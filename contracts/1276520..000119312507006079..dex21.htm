GAAP or Applicable SAP, as appropriate, Genworth will deliver to the Buyer
GenworthÂ’s good faith calculation of the Estimated Closing Total Equity
computed in accordance with Section 2.6(h) as of the Closing Date, together
with reasonably detailed supporting work papers.



 

15 (b) No later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Genworth will cause KPMG LLP
to prepare and deliver to Genworth and the Buyer: (i) audited balance sheets
for the Stock Sale Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
with the audited balance sheets of GEGA and DHI prepared in accordance with
GAAP and the audited balance sheets of GLHIC and PIC prepared in accordance
with Applicable SAP in each case based on the Books and Records and prepared
in a manner consistent with GAAP or Applicable SAP, as applicable, and
consistent in all material respects with the procedures and methodologies
applied to the GAAP Financial Statements and Statutory Statements, as
applicable (collectively, the "Final Closing Balance Sheet"); (ii) a schedule
of unadjusted financial statement differences not reflected in the audited
balance sheet; and (iii) a preliminary calculation of the Final Closing Total
Equity computed in accordance with _Section 2.6(h)_ as of the Closing Date.
KPMG LLP shall conduct such audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. For purposes of such
closing balance sheets and of the calculation of Final Closing Total Equity,
any and all uncorrected adjustments identified by KPMG LLP pursuant
to Section 2.6(b)(ii) will be recorded in the audited closing balance sheets
and reflected in Final Closing Total Equity.

(c) In connection with the preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and
the calculation of the Final Closing Total Equity, and during the period of
any dispute under this _Section 2.6_, the Buyer and Genworth shall (i)
provide the other party and the other partyÂ’s authorized representatives with
reasonable access to the relevant personnel, properties, and books and records
and (ii) cooperate in good faith with the other party and its
authorized representatives, including by providing on a timely basis all
information necessary or useful in preparing the Final Closing Balance Sheet
or calculating the Final Closing Total Equity.

(d) During the 30 day period following the BuyerÂ’s receipt of the Final
Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of the Final Closing Total Equity,
Genworth (i) will permit the Buyer and its accountants to review the working
papers of Genworth as well as such other documents as the Buyer may reasonably
request and (ii) will cooperate with, and be reasonably available to, the
Buyer to provide such other information reasonably requested relating to the
Final Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Final Closing Total
Equity; _provided,_ _however_ , that the accountants of Genworth will not
be obligated to make any work papers available to the Buyer and its
accountants unless and until the Buyer has signed a customary agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such accountants. The Final Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Final Closing Total Equity will become final and binding
upon the parties on the 30th day following delivery thereof to the Buyer,
unless objected to by the Buyer. If the Buyer objects to the preparation of
the Final Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of Final Closing Total
Equity, the Buyer must deliver a written notice (" _Buyer Â’s Notice_") to
Genworth prior to the 30th day following delivery of the Final Closing
Balance Sheet and calculation of the Final Closing Total Equity that specifies
in reasonable detail the amount by which and the reasons why it believes
particular line items in the Final Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of
the Final Closing Total Equity fail to comply with the requirements of
_Section 2.6(b)_ or the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing
Equity contained any numerical error.



 

16 (e) Within ten Business Days after GenworthÂ’s timely receipt of the
BuyerÂ’s Notice, the Buyer and Genworth shall begin good faith negotiations to
resolve such disagreement. If such parties are unable to resolve such
disagreement within ten Business Days after such negotiations begin, then
either the Buyer or Genworth may submit such disagreement to the Third Party
Accountants, for resolution in a manner consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that such resolution by
the Third Party Accountants shall be limited to a determination as to whether
the disputed items of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing
Total Equity (i) failed to comply with the requirements of _Section 2.6(b)_
or (ii) contained any numerical error. The parties shall cooperate with the
Third Party Accountants and shall proceed in good faith to cause the Third
Party Accountants to resolve such disagreement as expeditiously as practicable
after such disagreement is submitted to the Third Party Accountants. The fees
and expenses of the Third Party Accountants shall be paid one-half by the
Buyer and one-half by Genworth.

(f) Each party shall provide the Third Party Accountants with such information
as the Third Party Accountants reasonably may request in resolving any
disagreement submitted to them, together with such other information as the
party reasonably believes relevant to the resolution of such disagreement;
_provided,_ _however_ , that the accountants of the Buyer, Genworth or the
Stock Sale Companies will not be obligated to make any work papers available
to the Third Party Accountants unless and until the Third Party Accountants
have signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, Genworth or their
respective accountants, as the case may be. The Third Party AccountantsÂ’
resolution of any such disagreement shall be reflected in a written report
that shall be delivered promptly (and in any event within 45 days after their
appointment) to, and shall be final and binding upon, the parties. In making
such determination, the Third Party Accountants may only consider those items
and amounts (and related items and amounts) as to which the Buyer and Genworth
have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified above and
must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that the determination of the Third Party Accountants
will neither be more favorable to Genworth than reflected in the Final Closing
Balance Sheet nor more favorable to the Buyer than reflected in BuyerÂ’s
Notice.

(g) Upon the earliest to occur of (i) the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Final Closing Total Equity becoming final pursuant to
_Section 2.6(d)_, (ii) the parties reaching an agreement pursuant to _Section
2.6(e)_ or (iii) the Third Party Accountants delivering their report pursuant
to _Section 2.6(f)_, then, within five Business Days after the earliest to
occur of the events described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, (A)
Genworth shall, if the Final Closing Total Equity is less than the Estimated
Closing Total Equity, pay to the Buyer the difference between the Estimated
Closing Total Equity and the Final Closing Total Equity, plus simple interest
thereon from and including the Closing Date to, but not including, the date
of payment at an annual interest rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate, and (B)
the Buyer shall, if the Final Closing Total Equity is  



 

17  greater than the Estimated Closing Total Equity, pay to Genworth the
difference between the Final Closing Total Equity and the Estimated Closing
Total Equity, plus simple interest thereon from and including the Closing
Date to, but not including, the date of payment, at an annual interest rate
equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The payments described in this subsection
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account
or accounts of the party entitled to receive such payments as such party
specifies in writing to the party required to make such payments in the manner
specified herein for delivery of notices. The "Adjustment Amount" shall equal
(i) if $280,400,000.00 is greater than the Estimated Closing Total Equity, the
amount by which $280,400,000.00 exceeds the Estimated Closing Total Equity
(which amount shall be subtracted from the Purchase Price to be paid on the
Closing pursuant to _Section 2.1_) and (ii) if the Estimated Closing Total
Equity is greater than $280,400,000.00, the amount by which the Estimated
Closing Total Equity exceeds $280,400,000.00 (which amount shall be added to
the Purchase Price to be paid on the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.1_).

(h) For purposes of this _Section 2.6_, "Estimated Closing Total Equity" and
"Final Closing Total Equity" shall mean the sum of (i) Adjusted Capital and
Surplus for GLHIC and PIC and (ii) Equity excluding Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income for GEGA and DHI shown on, with respect to the Estimated
Closing Total Equity, the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and, with respect to
the Final Closing Total Equity, the Final Closing Balance Sheet for each
company, respectively. As used herein, "Adjusted Capital and Surplus for
GLHIC and PIC" means the total statutory capital and surplus of GLHIC and PIC
calculated in accordance with Applicable SAP, as (A) _increased_ by the sum
of (i) the Asset Valuation Reserve of GLHIC and PIC and (ii) the carrying
value of the non-admitted assets of GLHIC and PIC and (B) _decreased_ by the
aggregate amount of any net deferred tax asset (as calculated on page 2,
line 16.2, column 1 of the Statutory Statements) of GLHIC and PIC, determined
in each of the foregoing cases as of the Closing Date.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any matter
that results in an actual adjustment to the Purchase Price in favor of the
Buyer pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ may not constitute Damages for
any indemnification claim by the Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.6_ or _Article
X_ to the extent of the applicable adjustment to Purchase Price.

     | (a) | Genworth has delivered to the Buyer: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | unaudited balance sheets of the Stock Sale Companies as of
December 31, 2004 and 2005, together with any exhibits, schedules and notes
thereto, and September 30, 2006 and the related statements of income for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 and the nine month period ending
September 30, 2006 (the "GAAP Financial Statements"); and 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | the annual and quarterly statements of the Insurance
Companies, including all exhibits, schedules or notes thereto and any
affirmations or certifications filed therewith, as filed with the appropriate
Governmental Authority for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005
and the quarters ended March 31, 2006, June 30, 2006, and September 30, 2006
(the "Statutory Statements").  
---|---|--- 



 

21 (b) The GAAP Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Stock Sale Companies on a combined basis as at
the respective dates and for the respective periods indicated therein and the
results of their income for the respective periods then ended, in each case,
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated, except for the deviations from GAAP expressly disclosed thereon.
The GAAP Financial Statements were derived from, prepared using, and are
consistent in all material respects with, the Books and Records.

(c) The Statutory Statements have been prepared in accordance with the
statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Applicable SAP
and such accounting practices have been applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated, except as expressly disclosed in the
respective exhibits, schedules and notes thereto. The Statutory Statements
were derived from, prepared using, and are consistent in all material respects
with, the Books and Records. The Statutory Statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position and results of operations on a
statutory basis, including, the admitted assets, liabilities, capital and
surplus, of each of the Insurance Companies as of the respective dates
thereof, in accordance with Applicable SAP. No deficiencies or required
adjustments with respect to the Statutory Statements have been asserted by
any Governmental Authority that have not been cured or otherwise resolved to
the satisfaction of such Governmental Authority and that have not been
described on _Schedule 3.6(c)_.

(d) The Books and Records (i) are true and correct in all material respects
and accurately present the information therein and (ii) have been maintained
in all material respects in accordance with sound business practices and
applicable Law.

3.7.  _Reserves_.

(a) The aggregate reserves as recorded in the Statutory Statements have been
determined in accordance with the Applicable SAP (except as set forth
therein), consistently applied throughout the periods covered therein. Except
as set forth in _Schedule 3.7(a)_, the insurance reserving practices and
policies of the Insurance Companies have not changed, in any material
respect, since December 31, 2005 and the results of the application of such
practices and policies are reflected in the Statutory Statements. The reserves
set forth in the Statutory Statements are fairly stated in accordance with
sound actuarial principles and meet the requirements of the Applicable
Insurance Laws.

(b) The reserves and other similar amounts with respect to insurance as
established or reflected in the GAAP Financial Statements were determined in
accordance with GAAP, consistently applied throughout the periods covered
therein. All such reserves and other similar amounts were adequate in all
material respects as of the respective dates of such statements, based upon
then current information and assumptions concerning investment income,
mortality and morbidity experience, persistency and  



 

22  expenses, to cover the best estimate of the total amount of all reasonably
anticipated matured and unmatured benefits, dividends, claims and
other liabilities of the Regulated Companies under all insurance contracts
under which the Regulated Companies had any liability (including any liability
arising under or as a result of any reinsurance, coinsurance or similar
contract) on the respective dates of such GAAP Financial Statements. Except
as set forth in _Schedule 3.7(b)_, the GAAP insurance and reserve practices
and policies of the Regulated Companies have not changed, in any material
respect, since December 31, 2005. The foregoing clauses (a) and (b) shall not
be construed as a guarantee of the ultimate adequacy of the reserves to cover
the liabilities or contingencies to which they relate.

(c) Genworth has delivered to the Buyer a true and complete copy of the
report, dated October 6, 2006, prepared by Milliman, Inc. and the follow-up
letter dated October 16, 2006 with an electronic copy of the revised Appendix
D projections for the report (the "Milliman Report"). Milliman, Inc. has not
issued any further adjustment or errata with respect to the Milliman Report.
Any historical information and data furnished to Milliman, Inc. by Genworth
and the Stock Sale Companies in connection with the preparation of the
Milliman Report was accurate in all material respects and was not inconsistent
in any material respect with the Statutory Statements or the Books and
Records from which such historical information and data were derived and such
other information and data furnished to Milliman, Inc. by Genworth and the
Stock Sale Companies in connection with the preparation of the Milliman
Report, as of the date of delivery to Milliman, Inc., was believed by Genworth
and the Insurance Companies, as applicable, in good faith to be reasonable.
Prior to the date hereof, Genworth provided to Buyer a copy of the Memorandum
and Spreadsheet forwarded to Buyer by Goldman Sachs and Co. on December 15,
2006, with respect to the handling of the deferred tax assets on the Milliman
Report.

3.8. _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_.

Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.8_, none of the Stock Sale Companies has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (including, without limitation,
obligations or liabilities arising from policyholder claims or guaranty
fund assessments), whether absolute, accrued, contingent or unasserted,
except for (i) liabilities reflected or reserved against in the GAAP Financial
Statements or the Statutory Statements or in the Statutory Statement notes,
exhibits, schedules, and interrogatories thereto in accordance with the
standards of disclosure applicable thereto, (ii) liabilities for losses, loss
adjustment expenses and unearned premiums incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since the date of the most recent

liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since the date of the most recent balance sheet
included in the GAAP Financial Statements which would have been otherwise
permitted under _Section 5.7_. Any litigation matter that is not required
to be reserved for or otherwise recognized under Applicable SAP or GAAP shall
not be subject to this _Section 3.8_. For the avoidance of doubt, any such
litigation matters shall be subject to any other representations applicable
thereto, including _Section 3.16_.

payments of less than $50,000 and (vi) any property used by Genworth or its

to which any of the Stock Sale Companies leases any Leased Real Property or
Leased Personal Property is listed on _Schedule 3.10_ (the "Leases") and is

default or event of default (or any event that with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a default) that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect under any of the Leases on the part of any of the
Stock Sale Companies or, to the Knowledge of Genworth, any other party to the
Leases.

---|---|--- 



     | (x) | outstanding power of attorney, or obligation or liability

and shrink wrap, click wrap or commercially available, off-the-shelf computer
programs and databases). 
---|---|--- 

Each such Contract, and each other Contract entered into or amended after the
date hereof that if in effect on such terms as of the date hereof would have
been such a Contract (a "New Contract"), is (or will be, in the case of New
Contracts) a legal, valid and binding obligation of the applicable Stock Sale
Company and is in full force and effect except as to enforceability which may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, moratorium, receivership or similar laws affecting
creditorsÂ’ rights generally and by general principles of equity (whether
considered at law or in equity). No Stock Sale Company, nor to the Knowledge
of Genworth, any other party thereto, is in default under or, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, would be in default under, or has provided
any notice of any intention to terminate, any of the Contracts listed on
_Schedule 3.11(a)_, except for such defaults or terminations which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) _Schedule 3.11(b)_ lists all Contracts providing reinsurance (it being
understood that group stop-loss insurance contracts issued by the Stock Sale
Companies are not included herein) to which any Stock Sale Company is a party
that are currently in effect (or pursuant to which a party continues to or
should reserve against potential liability) (the "Reinsurance Agreements") on
the date of this Agreement. All such Reinsurance Agreements are legal, valid,
binding and in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. No Stock
Sale Company is, and, to the Knowledge of Genworth, no other party thereto
is, in default of or, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would
be in default of any provision thereof, which default would reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and, except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.11(b)_, no such Reinsurance Agreement contains any provision
providing that the other party thereto may terminate the same by reason of the
transactions contemplated  



 

28  by this Agreement or any other provision that would be altered or otherwise
become applicable by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby. Except
for the Contracts referenced in _Section 3.25_, no Stock Sale Company has
assumed any ceded reinsurance. Except as required by Law or as disclosed on
_Schedule 3.11(b)_, all amounts owed under any Reinsurance Agreement have
been paid in accordance with the terms of the Reinsurance Agreements under
which they arose, except for any matters listed on _Schedule 3.11(b)_ for
which Genworth reasonably believes there is a reasonable basis to contest
payment. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.11(b)_, to the Knowledge of
Genworth, no reinsurer that is a party to any of such Reinsurance Agreements
has a valid defense to payment of its material obligations under such
Reinsurance Agreements.

(c) There have been made available to the Buyer true and complete copies of
(i) all Contracts required to be set forth in  _Schedule 3.11(a)_, except
Contracts to which Genworth or its Affiliates (other than the Stock Sale
Companies) are a party and (ii) reinsurance agreements required to be set
forth in _Schedule 3.11(b)_. None of the Contracts providing reinsurance (it
being understood that group stop-loss insurance Contracts issued by the Stock
Sale Companies are not included therein) to which any Stock Sale Company is a
party that is not currently in effect (and which no party continues to or
should reserve against a potential liability) will impose any monetary or
other material obligations on any Stock Sale Company.

3.12. _Employee Benefits_.

(a) The Stock Sale Companies do not maintain or sponsor any Employee Benefit
Plan. 

(b) _Schedule 3.12(b)_ sets forth a true and correct list of each bonus,
pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock
ownership, stock purchase, stock appreciation, restricted stock, stock option,
phantom stock, performance, retirement, thrift, savings, stock bonus,
cafeteria, paid time off, perquisite, fringe benefit, vacation, severance,
termination, retention, change of control, disability, death benefit,
hospitalization, medical or other welfare benefit or other plan, program,
arrangement or understanding, including each "employee pension benefit plan"
(as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and "employee welfare benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), in each case maintained or contributed to,
or required to be maintained or contributed to, by each of Genworth or its
Affiliates, providing compensation or benefits to any current or former
employee of the Stock Sale Companies (each such plan, an "Employee Benefit
Plan" and, collectively, the "Employee Benefit Plans"). 

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code, and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS and nothing has occurred, whether
by action or by failure to act, that caused or could cause the loss of such
qualification or the imposition of any penalty or tax liability. _Schedule
3.12(c)_ contains a true, complete and correct copy of the most recent IRS
determination letter(s) with respect to the Genworth Retirement and Savings
Plan.



 

29 (d) None of the Stock Sale Companies is obligated to provide or to pay any
benefits to former employees, or to their dependents or beneficiaries, as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

(e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.12(e)_, as of the Closing Date there
will be no bonuses, profit sharing arrangements, incentives, commissions or
other compensation of any kind, including severance benefits, or accrued
vacation time or pay, sick leave pay, bonuses partially earned, deferred
compensation plans or other long or short-term compensation plans under which
there are service or performance credits pending or due to any employee
of Genworth or its Affiliates assigned to any of the Stock Sale Companies
(the "Employees") with respect to employment or termination of employment
prior to the Closing which have not been fully paid. No severance pay
obligation under any Employee Benefit Plan, under any Contract or at Law,
with respect to the Employees, will be triggered by the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor will there be any acceleration of vesting or payment
obligation under any Employee Benefit Plan.

(f) All contributions, premiums or other payments (including all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) which are due have
been paid to each of the Employee Benefit Plans and all contributions,
premiums or other payments for any period ending on or before the Closing
Date which are not yet due have been paid to each such Employee Benefit Plan
or accrued properly on the date of the most recent Financial Statements of
each of the Stock Sale Companies.

(g) None of the Stock Sale Companies and the other members of any Controlled
Group of Corporations (as defined in Code Section 1563) that may include any
of the Stock Sale Companies, has contributed to, presently contributes to, or
prior to Closing will contribute to, any Multiemployer Plan or has any
liability (including withdrawal liability) under any Multiemployer Plan, or
has ever been required to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan.

3.13. _Employees; Labor Matters_.

(a) On or immediately following the date of this Agreement, Genworth will
provide the Buyer with a complete and accurate list (the "Employee List") of
(i) the following information for each employee of Genworth or its Affiliates
assigned to any of the Stock Sale Companies (the "Employees") as of the date
the schedule is provided, including each Employee on leave of absence or
layoff status: employee number; job title; location; date of birth; if such
Employee is responsible for marketing or selling any Stock Sale Business, the

2005 and, to the extent available, 2006; rate of compensation (whether in the
form of salary, bonus, commission or other supplemental compensation now or
hereafter payable); accrued paid time off; and service credited for purposes
of vesting and eligibility to participate under the Employee Benefit Plans
and (ii) each employee who was assigned to the Stock Plan Companies on
September 30, 2006 who remains employed by Genworth or its Affiliates but is
no longer assigned to the Stock Plan Companies. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.13(a)_, the Employees on the Closing  



 

30  Date will be the same as the Employees listed on the Employee List (other
than Employees who terminate employment or are terminated by the Company prior
to the Closing Date). Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13(a)_, neither
Genworth nor its Affiliates have any employment, consulting, or other
compensation contracts written or oral, relating to any Employee.

(b) To the Knowledge of Genworth, no Employee is a party to, or is otherwise
bound by, any agreement or arrangement, including any confidentiality,
noncompetition, or proprietary rights agreement, between such Employee and any
other person that in any way will adversely affect (i) the performance of his
or her duties as an Employee, or (ii) the ability of any of the Stock Sale
Companies to conduct its respective Stock Sale Business as it is presently
being conducted.

(c) To the Knowledge of Genworth, each of the Stock Sale Companies has
complied in all material respects with all laws relating to the employment of
labor, including those relating to equal employment opportunity,
nondiscrimination, immigration, benefits, occupational safety and health,
plant closing, wages and hours. Each of the Stock Sale Companies has caused to
be paid or made provision for and will pay, or caused to be paid (if payable
on or before the Closing Date), all salaries and wages accrued through
the Closing Date to or for the benefit of or with respect to the Employees.
None of the Stock Sale Companies is liable for the payment of any material
amounts (whether designated as compensation, damages, fines, penalties, or
otherwise) for failure to comply with any of the foregoing.

(d) As of the date hereof, none of the Stock Sale Companies is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement with any labor union or organization
pertaining to any of the Employees and, as of the date hereof, no labor union

any Employees. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Genworth: (i) no
labor organization has made a pending demand to any of the Stock Sale
Companies for recognition as the bargaining representative of any of the
Employees; (ii) there are no representation petitions pending before the
National Labor Relations Board with respect to any of the Employees; and (iii)
no union organizing activities are in progress with respect to any of the
Employees.

there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Genworth, threatened strikes or
lockouts involving Employees; (ii) there is no strike, formal dispute, formal
grievance, arbitration proceeding, general slowdown, work to rule or work

charges or complaints of discrimination, harassment, or otherwise, pending or,
to the Knowledge of Genworth, threatened against any of the Stock Sale
Companies before the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or
any other federal, state, local or foreign agency, board or tribunal that
would become the BuyerÂ’s responsibility on the Closing Date.



 

31 (f) With respect to each of the Stock Sale Companies, there will have been no
"mass layoff" or "plant closing," as defined by WARN within 12 months prior
to the Closing Date.

3.14. _Technology and Intellectual Property_.

(a) Set forth in _Schedule 3.14(a)_ is a complete and accurate list of (i)
registrations and applications for registrations for patents, trademarks,
service marks, copyrights or domain names owned or filed by the Stock Sale
Companies or exclusively licensed to any of the Stock Sale Companies by
Genworth or its Affiliates ("Registered Intellectual Property"), in each case
specifying the owner thereof and the jurisdiction in which the applicable
registration has been obtained or pending application has been filed and,
where applicable, the registration or application number therefor and (ii)
all material common law trademarks or service marks that, to the Knowledge of
Genworth, are Owned Intellectual Property. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.14(a)_, all registrations, applications therefor, filings and issuances
with respect to any Registered Intellectual Property are, and remain, in full
force and effect. No action (including payment of any registration,
maintenance or renewal fees) must be taken within 180 days following the
Closing which, if not taken, would result in the loss or prejudice of any
right, or the incurrence of any incremental cost, with respect to any
registrations or, applications for any Registered Intellectual Property. 

(b) _Schedule 3.14(b)_ sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
material computer programs and databases (other than shrink wrap, click wrap
or commercially available, off-the-shelf computer programs or databases) used
by or on behalf of the Stock Sale Companies in their respective businesses as
currently conducted (the "Material Computer Programs"). All Intellectual
Property that has been licensed by or on behalf of the Stock Sale Companies is
being used in material compliance with the applicable license pursuant to
which the Stock Sale Companies have the right to use such Intellectual
Property.

(c) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.14(c)_, (i) the Stock Sale Companies

the authorized use of Intellectual Property.

(d) To the Knowledge of Genworth, the business and operations of the Stock
Sale Companies as currently conducted and the use of any Intellectual
Property by or on behalf of the Stock Sale Companies in the conduct of their
respective businesses as currently conducted do not breach, violate, infringe
or contribute to the infringement of any rights of a third party in
any Intellectual Property. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(d)_, none
of Genworth, its Affiliates or any Stock Sale Company (i) has  



 

32  received any written notice of any infringement or contributory infringement
of the rights of any third party with respect to any Intellectual Property
owned or used by the Stock Sale Companies and, (ii) to the Knowledge of
Genworth, there is no basis for a claim that the Owned Intellectual Property
or the Intellectual Property used by the Stock Sale Companies infringes,
misappropriates, dilutes or violates another PersonÂ’s Intellectual Property
rights or (iii) there are no claims pending or, to the Knowledge of Genworth,
threatened, challenging the ownership, validity or enforceability of any Owned
Intellectual Property.

 

(e) The Stock Sale Companies are in compliance with all privacy Laws or
policies of or applicable to the Stock Sale Companies, including, without
limitation, providing the Buyer with any information, including customer and
policyholder information, that has been or is expected to be provided to the
Buyer prior to, on or after the date hereof in connection with
the transactions and provision of services contemplated hereby.

(f) Each Stock Sale Company has established and is in material compliance
with security programs that are designed to protect (i) the security,
confidentiality and integrity of transactions executed through its computer
systems, including encryption and/or other security protocols and techniques,
when appropriate, (ii) the security, confidentiality and integrity of all
confidential or proprietary data and (iii) against unauthorized access to
their systems and the systems of such third party service providers which have
access to their data. To the Knowledge of Genworth, none of Genworth, its
Affiliates or any Stock Sale Company have suffered a material security breach
with respect to the data used in the businesses of the Stock Sale Companies or
the systems used in the businesses of the Stock Sale Companies. Except as has
been disclosed to Buyer in writing immediately prior to the date hereof, none
of Genworth, its Affiliates or any Stock Sale Companies has notified (i) any
Employee of an information security breach in connection with such EmployeeÂ’s
confidential information or (ii) any consumers of the Stock Sale Companies of
any information security breach.

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3(b) or 3.14(g)_, all Intellectual
Property that is used by or on behalf of the Stock Sale Companies in the
conduct of their businesses as currently conducted will be capable of being
used by the Stock Sale Companies upon and after the Closing, without the
consent, approval, waiver or authorization of any other party thereto or any
third party, and such use will not constitute a breach thereof or a violation
of any applicable Laws.

of Genworth or the Stock Sale Companies has received any notice of any
violation of any Applicable Law other than communications regarding failure to
comply with policy forms, annual information filings made concurrently with
the filing of the Statutory Statements and other similar  



 

33  filings which are handled in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, none of which individually or in the aggregate would be
material. Each of the Stock Sale Companies and, to the Knowledge of Genworth,
their independent agents, has marketed, sold, underwritten, administered and
issued products of the Stock Sale Companies in compliance in all material
respects with the Laws applicable to the Stock Sale Business. Each of the
Stock Sale Companies is in material compliance with its own and GenworthÂ’s
policies, in each case applicable to its collection, use and disclosure of
personal or private information of customers or consumers. Except as
otherwise set forth in _Schedule 3.15(a)_, the Stock Sale Companies hold all
Permits necessary for the conduct of the Stock Sale Business as presently
conducted. All of such Permits are valid and in full force and effect, and no
Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of Genworth, threatened that would
reasonably be expected to result in the suspension, revocation or limitation
of any such Permit. Except as set forth in  _Schedule 3.15(a)_, none of the
Stock Sale Companies has received any notice of any material violation of any
Permit applicable to it or to any of its properties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the representations contained in this  _Section 3.15_ do not
relate to the Permits identified on _Schedule 3.3(a)_, which are instead the
subject of _Schedule 3.3(a)_; employee benefits matters, which are instead
the subject of _Schedule 3.12_ and  _Article VIII_ ; or any Tax Matters,
which are instead the subject of _Article VII_.

(b) Except as set forth in  _Schedule 3.15(b)_ and except for any failure to
comply that would not reasonably be considered material:



     | (i) | all forms of insurance policies, insurance Contracts and
amendments and riders thereto (collectively, "Policies") in force that were
issued by the Regulated Companies or that the Regulated Companies have a
current contractual obligation to issue, are, to the extent required under the
insurance Laws of any applicable jurisdiction (collectively, "Applicable
Insurance Laws"), in all material respects, on forms approved by applicable
Governmental Authorities of the jurisdiction where issued or have been filed
with and not objected to by such Governmental Authorities within the period
provided for objection; 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | all Policy applications in respect of Policy forms in force
that were issued by any of the Regulated Companies and that are required to be
filed with or approved by applicable Governmental Authorities under
Applicable Insurance Laws have been so filed or approved;

all material respects in accordance with Applicable Insurance Laws; 
---|---|--- 


     | (iv) |

any premium rates with respect to Policies that were issued by any of the
Regulated Companies, which rates are, or were at the time such policies were
issued, required to be filed with or approved by applicable Governmental
Authorities under Applicable Insurance Laws have been so filed or approved and
premiums charged   

---|---|--- 



 

34  conform to the rates so filed or approved subject to such changes that may
have been effected in accordance with Applicable Insurance Laws;  

---|--- 



     | (v) | all Contracts to which any Regulated Company is a party that
are required to be filed with or approved by a Governmental Authority have
been so filed or approved; and  
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | no material deficiencies have been asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to any such filings referred to in this
_Section 3.15(b)_ that have not been cured or otherwise resolved to the
satisfaction of such Governmental Authority. 
---|---|--- 

(c) Genworth has previously made available to the Buyer true and complete
copies of (i) the reports (or the most recent draft thereof, to the extent any
final report is not available) available as of the date hereof reflecting the
results of the most recent financial examinations and market conduct
examinations of any of the Regulated Companies issued by any insurance
regulatory authority or the California Department of Managed Healthcare and
(ii) all actuarial opinion memoranda filed in the domiciliary state prior to
the date hereof in connection with any of the Insurance CompaniesÂ’ year-end
financial statements during the preceding three years.

(d) Each of the Stock Sale Companies has filed or otherwise provided all
material reports, data, registrations and other information and applications
required to be filed with or otherwise provided to any federal, state or
local Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over such company, and all
required Permits in respect thereof are in full force and effect. Except as
set forth in _Schedule 3.15(d)_, no material deficiencies have been
asserted by any such Governmental Authority with respect to any such
regulatory filings or submissions.

(e) Each of the Insurance Companies has delivered or made available to the
Buyer true and complete copies of all underwriting manuals (including each
amendment thereto) currently utilized by that Insurance Company and all group
bulletins proposed or implemented since January 1, 2002. The underwriting
standards and ratings applied by each Insurance Company since such date with
respect to Policies issued and/or ceded by that Insurance Company have
conformed in all material respects to those contained in the underwriting
manuals utilized by that Insurance Company or to those stipulated under the
terms of any reinsurance agreement pursuant to which Polices are ceded, as in
effect at the times such Policies were underwritten or ceded, as the case may
be. 

(f) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 3.15(f)_, all Policy benefits owed by
any of the Stock Sale Companies have been or will be paid, and all Policy
claims have been or will be settled, all in a timely manner in accordance with
the terms of the Policies under which they arose, except for such benefits or
claims that the appropriate Stock Sale Company reasonably believes there is a
reasonable basis to contest.



 

35 (g) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.15(g)_, no outstanding Policy
issued, reinsured or underwritten by any of the Regulated Companies entitles
the holder thereof or any other Person to receive any dividends,
distributions, experience rating refunds or other benefits based on the
revenues or earnings of any other Person. Other than Policies issued under
the Group Executive Ordinary, Select Executive Life and Select Executive
Ordinary plans, no Policies which would constitute or be deemed to constitute
corporate owned life insurance or similar tax advantaged group life insurance
policies, have been written by any Regulated Company.

(h) Except as set forth in  _Schedule 3.15(h)_ and except for any failure to
comply that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, each Producer at the time such Producer wrote, sold or produced
business for any Stock Sale Company was duly licensed and properly appointed
by such Stock Sale Company as a Producer (for the type of business written,
sold or produced by such Producer), where required. To the Knowledge of
Genworth and except as set forth on _Schedule 3.15(h)_, Genworth has used
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with industry standards and
practice to establish and monitor a compliance program that by its terms
requires that (i) each Producer or Service Provider that markets,
underwrites, sells, produces or administers Policies in connection with the
Stock Sale Business was, to the extent required by Law, duly licensed and/or
appointed with respect to the actions taken by such Producer or Service
Provider in connection with the Stock Sale Business; (ii) all commissions,
expense allowances, benefit credits and other fees paid to each such Producer
or Service Provider were paid in all material respects in accordance with
applicable Law; and (iii) each such Producer and Service Provider complies
with applicable Law.

3.16. _Litigation_.

Except as otherwise set forth in _Schedule 3.16_ and except for any liability
solely for policy benefits arising out of claims asserted against any of the
Stock Sale Companies between the date hereof and the Closing, (a) there are no
claims, audits, actions, suits, arbitrations, investigations or proceedings,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each,
a "Proceeding") pending or, to the Knowledge of Genworth, threatened against
or affecting Genworth or any of the Stock Sale Companies before any
Governmental Authority or arbitrator, that if resolved adversely to Genworth
or any of the Stock Sale Companies would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, materially affect the operations of the
Stock Sale Companies as currently conducted or result in or seek damages
payable by or sought against the Stock Sale Companies in excess of $100,000
or challenge the validity of this Agreement or seek to prevent or delay any
action taken or to be taken by Genworth or the Stock Sale Companies in
connection herewith and (b) there are no judgments, orders,
warrants, injunctions or decrees of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator
binding on any of the Stock Sale Companies that (i) have been issued by any
insurance regulatory authority, (ii) would materially restrict the ability of
any of the Stock Sale Companies to conduct its Stock Sale Business as now
being conducted, (iii) would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or (iv) would prevent or delay the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the
avoidance of doubt, the exception for any liability for policy benefits in the
foregoing sentence shall not include any Damages for legal  



 

36  or other defense costs relating to policy benefits. None of the Stock Sale
Companies is in default under any judgment, decree, injunction or order of
any Governmental Authority or arbitrator outstanding against it. No
Proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is (i)
pending, (ii) dismissed with rights of appeal not fully lapsed or (iii) to the
Knowledge of Genworth, threatened, in each case before any Governmental
Authority, that questions the validity of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or that presents a risk of the restraint or
prohibition of the transactions contemplated hereby or the obtaining of
material damages or other material relief in connection herewith or deprives,
or would reasonably be expected to deprive, the Buyer of any of the material
benefits hereunder or that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

3.17. _Brokers_.

All discussions and negotiations relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby have been carried out without the

any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement.

5.5. _Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation_.

(a) Except as otherwise agreed by the parties hereto in writing, a party
hereto and its Affiliates receiving Confidential Information (the "Receiving
Party") shall hold all such Confidential Information in the strictest
confidence at all times, making no use thereof (including for the purpose of
competing with the other party or any of its Affiliates) other than in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Receiving Party shall not without the prior written approval of
an appropriate officer of any other party or its Affiliates who furnishes
Confidential Information (the "Disclosing Party"): (i) release any
Confidential Information to any Person other than Persons directly involved in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) duplicate or otherwise
reproduce any Confidential Information except as required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) reverse engineer,
reverse compile, or otherwise subject any software used by the Buyer, Genworth

proprietary notice on any software or other object owned, leased or licensed
by the Buyer, Genworth or the Stock Sale Companies. At any time upon written
request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall return all records
and copies of Confidential Information, in whatever form then existing, to an
appropriate officer of the Disclosing Party or destroy all copies thereof
(except to the extent that such Confidential Information is retained in
archival back-up tapes or similar storage media, in which case such
Confidential Information is not to be used for any purpose by the Receiving
Party other than for archival purposes), and certify to the Disclosing Party
in a writing signed by an authorized officer of the Receiving Party as to such
destruction; provided that after the Closing, the Buyer need not comply with
any request pursuant to the prior sentence to the extent it relates to
Confidential Information concerning the Stock Sale Companies.



 

46 (b) In the event that the Receiving Party is requested or required (by oral
questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, the Receiving Party agrees that it will provide the Disclosing
Party with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that
the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this _Section 5.5_. If, failing the entry
of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Receiving
Party is, in the opinion of its counsel, compelled to disclose Confidential
Information, the Receiving Party may, notwithstanding the terms of paragraph
(a) of this _Section 5.5_, disclose that portion of the Confidential
Information which its counsel advises it is compelled to disclose and will
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to that portion of the Confidential Information
that is being disclosed. In any event, the Receiving Party will not oppose
any action by the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order
or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the
Confidential Information. 

(c) The Receiving Party shall be liable hereunder for the actions and
inactions of itself, its Affiliates that receive such Confidential
Information and its and such AffiliatesÂ’ officers, directors, employees,
advisers and representatives, all of whom shall be required by the Receiving
Party to abide by the provisions of this Agreement as though made parties
hereto. 

(d) The Receiving Party shall not, and shall not permit any of its
representatives to, communicate with any Person concerning any other aspect
of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than Persons reasonably
required to assist the Receiving Party in its analysis of the Confidential
Information in order to effect the transactions contemplated hereby. 

(e) Each Receiving Party stipulates that breach of the provisions of this
_Section 5.5_ concerning Confidential Information could cause the Disclosing
Party, or the rightful owner of the subject of such matters, irreparable
injury inadequately compensable through monetary damages, and accordingly,
agrees that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief
against such breach or threatened breach, in addition to any other available
remedies; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to restrict the right of a Receiving Party to oppose the assertion
that it has breached the terms of this _Section 5.5_ or that such a
threatened breach exists.

(f) After the date of this Agreement, Genworth shall take all such action (at
the sole cost and expense of Buyer) as is reasonably necessary to enforce all
of its rights under, and shall not waive or amend any provision of,
confidentiality agreements with prospective bidders relating to the sale of
the Stock Sale Companies (the "Third Party Confidentiality Agreements"),
including seeking injunctive and other equitable relief.  



 

47  Any monetary damages for breaches of the Confidentiality Agreements and
relating to the Stock Sale Companies recovered following the Closing shall
be promptly provided to the Buyer.

(g) If no Closing occurs, then until two years after the date hereof, the
Buyer shall not directly or indirectly solicit for employment or hire or
employ any of the Employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that such restrictions
shall not apply to any Employee (i) at any time more than 30 days after such
person has ceased to be such an Employee or (ii) with whom the Buyer does not
come into contact, or that the Buyer does not learn about, from the
Confidential Information or any negotiations or due diligence in connection
with the execution of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall not be prevented from hiring
any Employee who contacts it on his or her own initiative without any direct
or indirect solicitation by the Buyer or its agents (other than through
general solicitations in industry journals, newspapers or similar publications
or through use of a search firm or similar agency that has not been directed
by the Buyer to contact such person).

(h) Until two years after the Closing Date, Genworth shall not solicit for
employment or hire or employ (or cause any Affiliate of Genworth to solicit
for employment or hire or employ) any Employee who remains an officer,
director or employee of the Stock Sale Companies after the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such restrictions shall not apply to
any Employee at any time more than 30 days after such person has ceased to be
such an Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Genworth shall not be
prevented from hiring any Employee other than (i) senior management of the
Stock Sale Companies or (ii) an Employee serving in an underwriting, claims,
distribution or actuarial function (other than Employees serving solely in a
clerical or administrative capacity) who contacts it on his or her own
initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by Genworth or its
agents (other than through general solicitations in industry journals,
newspapers or similar publications or through use of a search firm or similar
agency that has not been directed by Genworth to contact such person).

5.6. _Investigations: Pre-Closing Access_.

(a) During the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date and subject
to applicable Laws, Genworth and the Buyer shall allocate sufficient
personnel and other resources and use commercially reasonable efforts to
develop, to mutually agree upon and, to the extent commercially reasonable and

conditions of the confidentiality provisions contained in _Section 5.5_. No
investigation made pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ or otherwise, whether made
before or after the date of this Agreement, and no matter disclosed pursuant

representation or warranty made by either party pursuant to this Agreement or
any rights of the parties under _Article VI_ or _Article X_.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Stock Sale Companies shall cease to
be insured by GenworthÂ’s or its AffiliatesÂ’ (other than one of the Stock Sale
Companies) insurance policies or by any of their self-insured programs to the
extent such insurance policies or programs cover the Stock Sale
Companies. With respect to events or circumstances relating to the Stock Sale
Companies that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date that are covered
by occurrence-based third party liability insurance policies and any workersÂ’
compensation insurance policies and/or comparable workersÂ’ compensation self-
insurance programs sponsored by Genworth and/or its Affiliates (other than one
of the Stock Sale Companies) and that apply to the Stock Sale Companies, the

shall cause its Affiliates to reasonably cooperate with the Buyer and its
Affiliates pursuing payment under any of the insurance policies covering the
Stock Sale Companies in effect as of the date hereof and, as applicable,
shall pay over to the Buyer or its Affiliates any amounts so collected;
_provided_ , _however_ , that by making any such claims, the Buyer agrees to
reimburse Genworth for any increased costs incurred by Genworth as a result
of such claims, excluding however any retroactive premium adjustments
associated with such coverage, as such amounts are determined in accordance
with those policies and programs generally applicable from time to time
to Genworth and its Affiliates (other  



 

52  than one of the Stock Sale Companies); _provided_ , _further_ , that neither
the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall make any such claims if, and to the
extent that, such claims are covered by insurance policies purchased or
sponsored by the Buyer and/or its Affiliates (including, after Closing, the
Stock Sale Companies).

(b) With respect to any open claims against GenworthÂ’s insurance policies
relating to the Stock Sale Companies prior to the Closing Date, Genworth

5.11_ attached hereto within the time periods set forth in such _Schedule
5.11_. Such information will be prepared in a manner consistent with past

5.12. _Transfers of Intellectual Property ; Use of Certain Owned Intellectual
Property_.

(a) Prior to or at Closing, Genworth shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to

Property that is set forth in _Schedule 5.12(a)_ used in the conduct of the
business of the Stock Sale Companies.

(b) Prior to or at the Closing, Genworth shall cause the Stock Sale Companies
to transfer to Genworth or its Affiliates or to such Person as Genworth may

goodwill, which the Stock Sale Companies may have in any Intellectual Property
that is set forth in Schedule 5.12(b) used in the conduct of the business of
the Stock Sale Companies.

(c) After the Closing, subject to Sections 5.12(a) and (b) Genworth and each
of its Affiliates on the one hand, and each Stock Sale Company on the other
hand, shall retain their respective ownerships rights in. and shall hold the
other Party harmless against Damages arising from its own use of any Owned
Intellectual Property that is jointly owned by or between (i) any Stock Sale
Company and (iii) Genworth or any Affiliate of Genworth (other than a Stock
Sale Company).

(d) Prior to or at the Closing, Genworth shall grant, or shall cause its
Affiliates to grant, to the Stock Sale Companies a worldwide, non-exclusive,
sublicenseable, transferable and irrevocable right to use all unregistered
Intellectual Property (other than common law trademarks or service marks)
owned by Genworth or its Affiliates and used, other than incidentally, in
the business of the Stock Sale Companies as of the date hereof.



 

53 (e) Genworth shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain all master
services agreements relating to the Contracts set forth on Schedule 3.14(h)
for the period of time from the date of this Agreement until (i) the services
being provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement to which such
master services agreement and Contract relate is terminated, (ii) the
Contract is transferred to a Stock Sale Company, (iii) the master services
agreement is cloned with a Stock Sale Company as a party thereto or (iv) a
replacement contract on terms reasonably acceptable to Buyer is obtained,
provided that GenworthÂ’s obligation pursuant to this Section 5.12(e) shall not
apply to those master services agreements disclosed in writing to the Buyer
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement that Genworth or one of its
Affiliates planned to terminate or replace such contract.

Effective as of the Closing Date, each of Genworth and, if applicable, the
Buyer and any of their respective Affiliates which is a party to the
Ancillary Agreements, shall enter into each of the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is a party.

5.14. _Non-Competition_. 

(a) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the last
day of the thirtieth month after the date hereof (the "Restricted Period"),
Genworth shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, engage in any Restricted Business (as defined below) in any
jurisdiction in which the Stock Sale Companies operate as of the Closing Date
within the United States (the "Restricted Territory") or otherwise compete in
the Restricted Products with the Buyer or the Stock Sale Companies in the
Restricted Territory. As used herein, "Restricted Business" means the
marketing, soliciting, underwriting, issuance, sale and administration of
Restricted Products. As used herein, "Restricted Products" means insurance
products and employment-based benefits and services in the following lines
of business (i) group life and accidental death and dismemberment, (ii) group
dental, (iii) group long-term disability, (iv) group short-term disability,
(v) group fully insured medical, and (vi) group medical stop loss. For the
avoidance of doubt, "group life" products do not include group annuity
products. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Restricted Products shall not be
deemed to include products of Genworth or its Affiliates that are sold in
joint marketing arrangements whereby non Restricted Products manufactured by
Genworth are bundled with Restricted Products of a third party and distributed
by such third party, so long as a purpose of GenworthÂ’s participation in such
joint marketing arrangements is not to circumvent the restrictions of this
Section 5.14.

(b) At any time following the Closing Date, none of Genworth or its
Affiliates or its or their successors shall, directly or indirectly, use or
transfer or otherwise disclose to any Person (including any Person that
becomes an Affiliate or successor of Genworth or any such Affiliate at
any time following the Closing Date) any Confidential Information about or
relating to the Stock Sale Business.



 

54 (c) If during the Restricted Period Genworth or any of its Subsidiaries
acquires, directly or indirectly, any Person in one or more transactions that
results in such Person becoming an Affiliate of Genworth or any of its
Subsidiaries and such Person engages in a Restricted Business, which
Restricted Business generated premiums of more than $200 million for its most
recent fiscal year, then Genworth shall, and shall cause such Subsidiary to,
divest such Restricted Business within 18 months of the closing of such
acquisition. For the avoidance of doubt, any series of one or more related or
unrelated transactions occurring during the Restricted Period shall be
aggregated for purposes of this Section 5.14(c). If such aggregation results
in the $200 million threshold of the foregoing sentence in this Section
5.14(c) being met, the divestiture requirements hereof will be applicable to
the Restricted Business acquired in the transaction that caused the $200
million threshold to be exceeded.

(d) The parties hereto recognize that the Laws and public policies of the
various States of the United States of America may differ as to the validity
and enforceability of covenants similar to those set forth in this _Section
5.14_. It is the intention of the parties that the provisions of this _Section
5.14_ be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and
policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought, and that the
unenforceability (or the modification to conform to such Laws or policies) of
any provisions of this _Section 5.14_ shall not render unenforceable
or impair the remainder of the provisions of this _Section 5.14_.
Accordingly, if at the time of enforcement of any provision of this _Section
5.14_, a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the restrictions stated
herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto
agree that the maximum period, scope or geographic area reasonable under such
circumstances will be substituted for the stated period, scope or geographical
area and that such court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions
contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and geographical area
permitted by applicable Law.

(e) Genworth expressly acknowledges that the restrictive covenants set forth
in this _Section 5.14_, including the geographic scope and duration of such
covenants, are necessary in order to protect and maintain the proprietary
interests and other legitimate business interests of the Buyer and its
Affiliates, and that any violation thereof could result in irreparable injury
to the Buyer and its Affiliates that would not be readily ascertainable
or compensable in terms of money, and therefore the Buyer and its Affiliates
shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent jurisdiction temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as damages, which rights
shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which
it may be entitled. Genworth further agrees that if it is determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable order that it has
willfully breached the terms of this  _Section 5.14_, the Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to recover from Genworth all costs and reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees incurred as a result of its attempts to redress such breach or
to enforce its rights and protect its legitimate interests.



 

55 (f) The parties hereto recognize that the Laws and public policies of the
various States of the United States of America may differ as to the validity
and enforceability of covenants similar to those set forth in this _Section
5.14_. It is the intention of the parties that the provisions of this _Section
5.14_ be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and
policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought, and that the
unenforceability (or the modification to conform to such Laws or policies) of
any provisions of this  _Section 5.14_ shall not render unenforceable or
impair the remainder of the provisions of this _Section 5.14_. Accordingly,
if at the time of enforcement of any provision of this _Section 5.14_, a
court of competent jurisdiction holds that the restrictions stated herein are
unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that
the maximum period, scope or geographic area reasonable under such
circumstances will be substituted for the stated period, scope or
geographical area and that such court shall be allowed to revise the
restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and
geographical area permitted by applicable Law.

(g) Genworth expressly acknowledges that the restrictive covenants set forth
in this _Section 5.14_, including the geographic scope and duration of such
covenants, are necessary in order to protect and maintain the proprietary
interests and other legitimate business interests of the Buyer and its
Affiliates, and that any violation thereof could result in irreparable
injury to the Buyer and its Affiliates that would not be readily
ascertainable or compensable in terms of money, and therefore the Buyer and
its Affiliates shall be entitled to seek from any court of competent
jurisdiction temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well
as damages, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other
rights or remedies to which it may be entitled. Genworth further agrees that
if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-
appealable order that it has willfully breached the terms of this _Section
5.14_, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to recover from Genworth
all costs and reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees incurred as a result of its attempts
to redress such breach or to enforce its rights and protect its legitimate
interests.

5.15. _Post-Closing Cooperation_. 

(a) Genworth and the Buyer shall cooperate with each other, and shall cause
their Affiliates and their respective officers, employees, agents, auditors
and representatives to cooperate with each other following the Closing, to
ensure the orderly transition of the Stock Sale Companies to the Buyer and to
minimize any disruption to the Stock Sale Companies that might result from
the transactions contemplated hereby. After the Closing, upon reasonable
written notice, each of Genworth and the Buyer shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other and their Affiliates and their respective employees,
counsel, auditors and representatives, access, during normal business hours,
to such information and assistance relating to the Stock Sale Companies (to
the extent within the control of such party) as is reasonably necessary for
financial reporting, Tax and accounting matters, determination of employee
benefits, compliance with the requirements of any Governmental Authority or
Law, determination and enforcement of rights and obligations under this
Agreement, and any actual or threatened action or proceeding. In addition,
after the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Genworth shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to the Buyer and its Affiliates and its employees,
counsel, auditors and representatives, access, during normal business hours,
to any Books and Records in the possession of Genworth or one of its
Subsidiaries.



 

56 (b) Following the Closing, Genworth shall either maintain or assign, and at
the direction of the Buyer, enforce or cooperate with the Buyer in the
enforcement of, any rights to indemnification from any third party with
respect to the Stock Sale Business after the Closing held by Genworth or any
of its Affiliates other than the Stock Sale Companies to the extent that such
rights remain on their terms in effect following the Closing. To the extent
Genworth recovers any amounts under such rights with respect to the Stock Sale
Business after the Closing, it shall pay to the Buyer any recoveries received
in connection therewith. The Buyer shall indemnify Genworth for any actions
taken and any costs incurred in following the direction of the Buyer pursuant
to this _Section 5.15(b)_.

(c) Following the date hereof, the parties shall work together in good faith
to determine appropriate terms relating to the DHI Stock and the CA Benefits
Stock in order to effect the intent of this Agreement and to comply with all
applicable Laws.

5.16. _COLI Liabilities_.

If, following the Closing, the Buyer receives notice (written or oral) from
any Person with respect to COLI Liabilities (a "COLI Notice") requiring it to
take any action, it shall notify Genworth of the receipt of such notice.
Genworth shall have the right to direct the Buyer to perform any reasonable
action required by the COLI Notice, at GenworthÂ’s sole cost and expense, and
the Buyer shall take such action as reasonably directed by Genworth. Genworth
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer from all Damages relating to or
resulting from such actions.

5.17. _Genworth Guarantees_.

Buyer hereby agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (without the
payment of any fees) to cause one of its Affiliates to replace Genworth or its
Affiliates as the guarantor of the real property leases to which the Stock
Sale Companies are a party that are set forth on _Schedule 5.17_ attached
hereto.

5.18. _Facilities Sublease_.

(a) Genworth shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed by such other Person as is appropriate, all Returns required to be filed
by or with respect to any Stock Sale Company on or before the Closing Date.
All such Returns will be filed when due (taking into account any extensions).

(b)(i) Genworth shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, in a manner consistent with past practice in all material
respects, any consolidated, unitary, combined or similar Return for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period that includes any of the Stock Sale Companies and at least
one other company that is not a Stock Sale Company and shall include, or cause
to be included, therein the income, gain, loss, deductions, expenses, credits,
and other Tax items of the appropriate Stock Sale Companies.

(ii) Genworth shall prepare or cause to be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practices in all material respects any Return for Income Taxes of
any of the Stock Sale Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that ends on or
before the Closing Date not otherwise covered by Section 7.2(b)(i) and shall

expenses, credits and other Tax items of the appropriate Stock Sale Companies.
Genworth shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, cause all Tax
periods of each Stock Sale Company to close on the Closing Date. Genworth
shall submit to Buyer each such Return at least 15 days prior to the due date
(including extensions) of such Return. Buyer shall timely file, or cause to be
timely filed by such other Person as appropriate, each such Return in the
form submitted to it by Genworth, unless otherwise required by Law or agreed
by Genworth and the  



 

62  Buyer. If Buyer believes that it would be a violation of Law to file any
Return submitted to it by Genworth, Buyer agrees to notify Genworth promptly
and to negotiate in good faith regarding the proper filing of such Return.

(c) Except for those Returns required to be filed in accordance with Section
7.2(b), the Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed by such other Person as is appropriate, subject to the Tax Pre-
Filing Review Procedure, all Returns with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (including Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are a portion of Tax periods
ending after the Closing Date) of each Stock Sale Company required to be filed
after the Closing Date. Such Returns shall be prepared, in all
material respects, in a manner consistent with the positions taken and
accounting methods used on the Returns filed by or with respect to the
appropriate Stock Sale Company prior to the Closing Date, unless otherwise
required by Law or agreed by Genworth and the Buyer.

(d) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause the Stock Sale Companies
to prepare and timely file, all Returns required to be filed by or with
respect to any Stock Sale Company for any Tax period beginning after the
Closing Date.

(e) Neither the Buyer nor any Stock Sale Company shall file any amended or
other Return for or relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior
written consent of Genworth, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;

similar Return that includes a company other than a Stock Sale Company,
Genworth may withhold consent within its sole discretion.

7.3. _Tax Payments_.

(a) Genworth shall timely pay or cause to be timely paid to the appropriate
Taxing Authority (without duplication of amounts otherwise payable or
previously paid) all Taxes required to be reported on any Returns required to
be prepared pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b)(i).

(b) The Buyer shall timely pay or cause to be timely paid to the appropriate
Taxing Authority all Taxes required to be reported on any Returns required to

(c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and similar Taxes incurred in connection with the sale of the Stock Sale
Companies pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid by the Buyer when due, and
the Buyer will, at its own expense, file all necessary Returns with respect to
all such Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, Genworth will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Returns that are
properly prepared. The Buyer will reimburse Genworth upon demand for any Taxes
paid by Genworth to obtain the appropriate transfer Tax stamps for delivery of
the certificates evidencing the Purchased Stock.



 

63 7.4. _Refunds_.

Genworth shall be entitled to receive and to retain any and all refunds
(including any interest) of Taxes of any Stock Sale Company for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period not accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet. In
the event the Buyer or any Stock Sale Company receives any Tax refund
(whether through payment, credit or reduction in Taxes) to which it is not
entitled hereunder, the recipient shall promptly pay, or cause the payment of,
the amount thereof to Genworth. The Buyer shall furnish or shall cause a
Stock Sale Company to furnish, as appropriate, Genworth with a power of
attorney or any other document or authorization necessary or appropriate to
enable Genworth to obtain any Tax refunds to which it is entitled under this
Section 7.4. In the event that any such Tax refund previously paid to Genworth
is subsequently reduced as a result of any adjustment required by any Taxing
Authority, Genworth shall promptly pay to the Buyer the amount of such
reduction, together with any interest, penalty, addition to Tax or additional
amount imposed with respect thereto by any Taxing Authority, net of any Tax
benefit to the Buyer or to the Stock Sale Companies attributable thereto.

 

7.5. _Cooperation_.

(a) The Buyer and Genworth shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the preparation, execution and filing of any Return,
and with any Tax Proceeding, of the Stock Sale Companies. However, no loss,
credit or other item of any of the Stock Sale Companies may be carried back
without GenworthÂ’s written consent, which Genworth may withhold in its
absolute discretion, to a Tax period for which (i) any of the Stock Sale
Companies and (ii) Genworth or any entity affiliated with Genworth filed a
consolidated, unitary, combined or similar Return.

(b) After the Closing Date, each Return prepared or caused to be prepared by
the Buyer with respect to any Stock Sale Company pursuant to Section 7.2(c)
shall be subject to pre-filing review by Genworth and, in the event of any
disagreement between Genworth and the Buyer or any Stock Sale Company,
Genworth and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
such disagreement. If Genworth and the Buyer do not reach agreement in a
reasonable period of time not to exceed 60 days, such disagreement shall be
resolved by the Third Party Accountants, and the determination by the Third
Party Accountants shall be final. If such determination is not received
before the due date (taking extensions into account) for filing the Return at
issue, the Buyer shall cause such Return to be timely filed. If the
determination is contrary to the position of the Buyer and if that position
was reflected in the Return as filed, the Buyer shall cause to be filed an
amended Return respecting such determination, and the Buyer shall pay,
indemnify Genworth and its Affiliates against, and hold Genworth and
its Affiliates harmless from any resulting interest, penalty and addition to
Tax. The fees and expenses of the Third Party Accountants shall be borne
equally by Genworth and the Buyer. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the
Returns subject to pre-filing review shall be submitted by the Buyer to
Genworth at least 20 days, 10 days in the case of premium tax Returns, prior
to the due date (including extensions) of such Return, and Genworth shall
either complete its review or provide written comments on such Return within
10 days, 5 days in the case of premium tax Returns, of receipt of such Return.
The procedure described in this Section 7.5(b) is referred to herein as the
"Tax Pre-Filing Review Procedure."

 



 

64 7.6. _Tax Indemnification_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Article VII, Genworth shall indemnify
the Buyer, its Affiliates, and the Stock Sale Companies against and hold each
harmless from:



     | (i) | any Tax of any Stock Sale Company for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, except: 
---|---|--- 

(1) Taxes paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority by or for the account of
the Stock Sale Companies on or prior to the Closing Date and

(2) to the extent of the amount of any accrued liability for Taxes on the
Final Closing Balance Sheet, reduced by the amount of actual payments of the
Tax Allocation Amounts provided for in Section 7.8; 



     | (ii) | any liability of a Stock Sale Company for Taxes of any
Person (other than a Stock Sale Company) as a result of having been a member
of a consolidated group that included General Electric Company or Genworth,
pursuant to any provision of joint and several liability including, without
limitation, Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 and any corresponding
provision of state or local Tax Law; 
---|---|--- 


     | (iii) | any liability for Taxes resulting from a breach or
inaccuracy of the representations contained in Section 3.12 or Section 7.1
(for this purpose, the breach of any representation or warranty shall be
determined without regard to materiality); 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | any Income Taxes attributable to the making of the Section
338(h)(10) Election; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, any
Taxes related to any step down in the basis of the assets of any of the Stock
Sale Companies resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election or any Taxes of
any Stock Sale Company as the "new target" corporation shall not be treated as
a Tax attributable to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election; 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | any amount payable after the Closing Date, as a Tax or
otherwise, as a result of a Stock Sale CompanyÂ’s being party to any Tax
Sharing Agreement entered into before the Closing Date other than any
payments provided for in Section 7.8; and 
---|---|--- 



 

65 resulting from adjustments to or changes in Tax items relating to any of the
Stock Sale Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, whether such adjustments
or changes are voluntarily made or are required by a Taxing Authority;
provided, however, it is understood and agreed for the avoidance of doubt that
there can be no such net increase in Income Tax with respect to any Stock
Sale Company in jurisdictions for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made. 
---|---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, Genworth
shall not indemnify Buyer for (i) any payments relating to current Income
Taxes made pursuant to Section 7.8 that Genworth timely remits to the
appropriate Taxing Authority in respect of the Stock Sale Companies, and (ii)
any other payments made pursuant to Section 7.8.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Article VII, the Buyer shall
indemnify Genworth and its Affiliates (other than the Stock Sale Companies)
from and against and hold them harmless from:



     | (i) | any Tax of any Stock Sale Company for a Post-Closing Tax
Period; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | all Taxes resulting from any action, taken without
GenworthÂ’s written consent by the Buyer or any of the Stock Sale Companies
after the Closing, in contravention of Section 7.2(e). 
---|---|--- 

In addition, the Buyer shall pay to Genworth (subject to the provisions of
Section 7.6(e) and without duplication thereof) the amount of any net
decrease in Taxes in a Post-Closing Tax Period resulting from adjustments to
or changes in Tax items relating to any of the Stock Sale Companies for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, whether such adjustments or changes are voluntarily
made or are required by a Taxing Authority; provided, however, it is
understood and agreed for the avoidance of doubt that there can be no such net
decrease in Income Tax with respect to any Stock Sale Company in
jurisdictions for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made.

(c)(i) Following the Closing Date, Genworth shall control the conduct of all
stages of any Tax Proceeding involving Taxes for which Genworth could be held
liable pursuant to this Article VII. The Buyer shall furnish or shall cause a
Stock Sale Company to furnish, as appropriate, Genworth with powers of
attorney or any other document or authorization necessary or appropriate to
enable Genworth to exercise the control provided Genworth in this Section
7.6(c). The Buyer (i) shall, within thirty days from its or any Stock
Sale CompanyÂ’s receipt of any written notice of any pending or threatened Tax
Proceeding with respect to which indemnification may be sought against
Genworth under this Article VII, provide written notice to Genworth thereof,
and (ii) shall not and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to take any
action with respect to any Tax Proceeding (including, without limitation,
accepting in whole or in part any proposed adjustment, waiving any right, or
entering into any settlement or agreement in compromise) that could result in
a claim for indemnification against Genworth pursuant  



 

66  to this Article VII without GenworthÂ’s express written consent.
Notwithstanding GenworthÂ’s obligations under Section 7.3 or under
this Section 7.6, Genworth shall have no obligation to pay or to indemnify or
hold Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Stock Sale Companies)
harmless from, and Buyer shall indemnify Genworth against, any Tax imposed or
assessed to the extent such Tax is greater than it would have been because of
(i) the failure of Buyer to notify Genworth as required by this paragraph, if
such failure adversely affects GenworthÂ’s ability to respond adequately in a
timely manner to the notice of a Tax Proceeding, or (ii) any action taken
without GenworthÂ’s written consent in contravention of the immediately
preceding sentence. Genworth may elect to forgo control of any Tax Proceeding
that it is entitled to control pursuant to this Section 7.6(c), and shall
notify the Buyer if Genworth elects to forgo such control. In that event, the
Buyer shall control the conduct of such Tax Proceeding, but shall afford
Genworth and its Tax advisors a reasonable opportunity to participate (at
GenworthÂ’s expense) in the conduct of such Tax Proceeding, including, without
limitation, the right to participate in conferences with Taxing Authorities
and submit pertinent material in support of GenworthÂ’s position.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything else in Section 7.6(c) or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall control the conduct of all the stages
of any Tax Proceeding involving Taxes included in the consolidated federal
Income Tax Return of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer for a Tax period
that begins after the Closing Date, and with respect to Post-Closing Tax
Period Taxes for which Genworth is the indemnifying party, GenworthÂ’s control
of the Tax Proceeding shall be limited to the Tax items it is responsible for
indemnifying.

(d) For purposes of this Article VII, in the case of any Taxes that are
payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing
Date, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (i)
in the case of any Taxes that are periodic and fixed in amount (for example,
real or personal property taxes), be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and
(ii) in the case of all other Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing
Date. The allocations of Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
made first without taking into account any Tax credits. The parties will
negotiate in good faith regarding the appropriate allocation of credits with
respect to any such Tax. All determinations necessary to give effect to the
foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Stock Sale Companies, unless otherwise required by Law or
agreed by Genworth and the Buyer.

(e) The amount of any Tax indemnification otherwise payable by Genworth under
this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of (or, in the case of a Tax
benefit to be realized subsequently, the then-present value of) any Tax
benefit for any Tax period to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
the Stock Sale Companies) resulting from any adjustment to or change in any
Tax item relating to any of the Stock Sale Companies  



 

67  for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Such present value shall be based on a
discount rate, per annum, equal to the applicable federal rate determined
pursuant to Section 1274(d) of the Code.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Genworth shall not
be liable for (and the Buyer shall pay, indemnify Genworth and its Affiliates
against, and hold Genworth and its Affiliates harmless from) any Taxes
resulting from any transaction or event that is outside the ordinary course of
business and occurs after the Closing but on the Closing Date, unless such
transaction or event is initiated by Genworth or a Stock Sale Company before
the Closing.

(g) The indemnifying party under this Section 7.6 shall also be responsible
for any reasonable fees and other out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable
outside professional fees and costs) incurred in contesting or otherwise in
connection with any Taxes indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.6, excluding
any fees or costs of counsel or other third-party advisors incurred by the
indemnified party without the indemnifying partyÂ’s prior written consent
while the indemnifying party has the right to control the Tax Proceeding to
which such fees and costs relate.

7.7.  _Section 338 Elections_

(a) Genworth and the Buyer shall timely make or shall cause the appropriate
Persons to timely make joint elections (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10)
Election"), with respect to the purchase of the stock of any of the Stock Sale
Companies identified in writing to Genworth no later than the Closing Date
under (i) Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and (ii) any analogous election with
respect to state, local or foreign income Taxes, to the extent that such
election is separately available, in each state, local and foreign
jurisdiction where such Stock Sale Companies (or any of them) currently file
income Tax Returns. Genworth and the Buyer shall report (or shall cause an
appropriate Person to report), in connection with the determination of Taxes,
the purchase of the stock of such Stock Sale Companies pursuant to this
Agreement in a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election.

(b) The Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of Form
8023 (together with any schedules or attachments thereto) that are required
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 and other forms that
are required to be submitted to any federal, state, county, or other local
taxing authority in connection with a Section 338(h)(10) Election (the
"Section 338 Forms"). Genworth shall execute, or shall cause an appropriate
Person to execute and deliver to Buyer such Section 338 Forms as are
requested by Buyer to complete properly the Section 338(h)(10) Election at
least 20 days before the date such Section 338 Forms are required to be filed;
provided that Buyer shall have delivered to Genworth all the Section 338
Forms properly completed in accordance with applicable Law no less than 45
days before the date such Section 338 Forms are required to be filed.

(c) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Genworth a written notice setting forth (with reasonable specificity) BuyerÂ’s
good faith  



 

68  calculation of aggregate deemed sales price ("ADSP ") and the allocation
thereof among the assets of the Stock Sale Companies in accordance with the
principles of the applicable Treasury regulations (the "BuyerÂ’s Allocation").
Within 20 Business Days after receipt thereof, Genworth shall deliver to Buyer
written notice indicating whether Genworth disagrees with the BuyerÂ’s
Allocation. If Genworth agrees with the BuyerÂ’s Allocation or if Genworth
fails to deliver such written notice within such 20 Business Days, BuyerÂ’s
Allocation shall constitute the "Agreed Allocation." If Genworth provides
timely written notice to Buyer of any disagreement with the BuyerÂ’s
Allocation, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine the Agreed
Allocation. If they do not reach agreement within 30 days after commencing
negotiations, the parties shall promptly submit the items in dispute to the
Third Party Accountant, who shall resolve all such disputed items and finalize
the Agreed Allocation as promptly as practicable. The fees and expenses of the
Third Party Accountant shall be borne equally by the parties. Except as
determined to the contrary by the appropriate Taxing Authority upon an audit
of its (or its AffiliatesÂ’) returns, the parties shall file (or cause to be
filed) all relevant Returns consistent with the Agreed Allocation and shall
not take (or permit any affiliate to take) any position inconsistent with the
Agreed Allocation unless required by law to do so); provided, however, that
(i) the deemed purchase prices of the assets may differ from the deemed sales
prices in order to reflect the BuyerÂ’s transaction costs not included in the
Agreed Allocation, and (ii) the amounts realized on the deemed sales of assets
may differ from the deemed sales prices reflected in the Agreed Allocation in
order to reflect transaction costs that reduce the amounts realized for
federal income Tax purposes.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Buyer makes
an election under Section 338 (other than the Section 338 (h)(10) Election)
with respect to any of the Stock Sale Companies, the Buyer shall prepare and
file the Returns for, be responsible for the payment of, indemnify and hold
Genworth and its Affiliates harmless from, and be entitled to any refund of,
any Taxes resulting from the election (and any corresponding election under
state or local Law). 

7.8. _Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements_.

Any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements shall be terminated with respect
to Genworth or a Genworth Affiliate and each Stock Sale Company as of the
Closing Date and thereafter neither Genworth (or any Genworth Affiliate) nor
any Stock Sale Company shall have any continuing liability or rights with
respect to each other under any such agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
as provided in Paragraph [4] of the Tax Sharing Agreements Release, to the
extent there is accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet a liability with
respect to any Stock Sale Company for Tax payments under a Tax Sharing
Agreement, that Stock Sale Company shall make a final payment under the Tax
Sharing Agreement equal to the amount so accrued. To the extent there is
accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet a receivable with respect to any
Stock Sale Company for Tax payments under a Tax Sharing Agreement, Genworth
shall make, or shall cause to be made, a final payment to that Stock Sale
Company under the Tax Sharing Agreement equal to the amount so accrued. In
addition, to the extent there is accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet a
liability for any Stock Sale Company for Taxes that is not
otherwise described in this Section 7.8 and that is associated with any
consolidated, unitary, combined, or similar Return that Genworth has
responsibility for filing  



 

69  pursuant to Section 7.2(b)(i) and for paying the Tax pursuant to Section 7.3
of this Agreement, the Stock Sale Company shall make a payment to Genworth
equal to the amount so accrued. Payments under this Section 7.8 are referred
to herein as the "Tax Allocation Amounts." The Tax Allocation Amounts shall be
payable at the time the Adjustment Amount described in Section 2.6(g) becomes
payable, or, if the Adjustment Amount is zero, when the Adjustment Amount
would be payable were it not zero.

7.9. _Survival and Exclusivity_.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
indemnification provisions of this Article VII shall survive until the
expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations with respect to the
assessment of Tax giving rise to a claim hereunder (giving effect to any
waiver or extension thereof), and subject to the requirements of Section
7.6(c), any claim for indemnity under this Article VII may be made at any time
prior to 60 days after the expiration of such statutes of limitations. Any
such claim shall be made by the indemnitee by providing to the indemnifying
party written notice thereof. Notwithstanding Article X or any other provision
of this Agreement, Genworth shall not have any liability under this Agreement
for or with respect to any Taxes of any of the Stock Sale Companies except
as otherwise expressly provided in this Article VII. For the avoidance of
doubt, any indemnification for Damages other than Taxes arising out of a
breach of any representations or warranty contained in Section 3.12 or 7.1(s)
shall be provided for in Article X.

7.10 _Second Closing_.

In the event of a Second Closing, insofar as they relate to DHI or CA
Benefits, all provisions in this Article VII shall be applied by substituting
the Second Closing for the Closing.

ARTICLE VIII

COVENANTS REGARDING EMPLOYEES

8.1. _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) Genworth and the Buyer agree that any obligations of any of the Stock Sale
Companies with respect to any of the Employee Benefit Plans and the
participation of each of the Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries
therein shall cease at the Closing Date and no Employee, dependent or
beneficiary shall have any claim against any of the Stock Sale Companies
arising out of such plans after the Closing Date. The Buyer (and each of the
Stock Sale Companies after the Closing Date) shall have no liability, duties
or obligations with respect to any Employee Benefit Plans or to any Employee,
former employee or beneficiary, dependent or other party enforcing the same
or having or claiming an interest thereunder, including governmental agencies.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Genworth shall take the necessary steps to
cause the transfer of each of the Employees to the Stock Sale Companies.

(c) As of the Closing Date, the Buyer agrees to initially continue the
employment of all of the Employees, including any Employee who has rights of
employment upon return from any vacation, approved leave or other approved
absence:  



 

70  (i) in the same or similar type of business as the Employees are engaged in
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) with a comparable total annual
cash compensation opportunity (i.e. base salary or wages together with cash
incentive or bonus opportunities); _provided,_ _however_ , that with respect
to any Employee who as of the Closing Date is on a disability leave of
absence, the Buyer shall have no obligation to employ such Employee unless
such Employee returns to work within one year following the date hereof. The
Buyer further agrees to provide the same benefits to the Employees as are
provided to similarly situated U.S. employees of the Buyer. The employee
benefit plans of the Buyer (the "Buyer Plans") shall not include a waiting or
eligibility period (except to the extent any such Employees are subject to a
waiting or eligibility period under the Employee Benefit Plans) or a
preexisting condition restriction or limitation and, to the extent that such
Employees have satisfied any internal limits, deductibles or co-payment
requirements of such Employee Benefit Plans for the year that includes the
Closing Date, such amounts will be credited toward the satisfaction of any
such requirements under the Buyer Plans. The Buyer will perform an analysis of
each Employee contribution or premium levels under BuyerÂ’s Employee Benefit
Plans as compared to GenworthÂ’s Employee Benefits Plans and will consider
taking action based on the results of such analysis.

(d) The Buyer and the Buyer Plans shall be responsible for any continuation
coverage obligations under COBRA with respect to each Employee and each

Each party entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (the "Indemnified
Party") shall give notice to the party required to provide such
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified
Party has knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give such notice shall
not affect the indemnification sought hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure (except that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnified Party failed to
give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to
the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to any third-party claim
as to which indemnity may be sought hereunder. The Indemnified Party shall
then permit the Indemnifying Party (at its expense) to assume the defense of
any claim or any litigation resulting therefrom;  _provided_ _that_ the
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at any time, but only at
such Indemnified PartyÂ’s expense. The Indemnified Party shall not be required
to commence litigation or take any action against any third party prior to
making a claim for indemnity hereunder. No Indemnifying Party, in the defense
of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each
Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release
from all liability with respect to such claim or litigation or (ii) includes
any relief  



 

75  thereunder other than for monetary damages. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any matter as above
provided, the Indemnified Party shall have the full right to defend against
any such claim or demand, and shall be entitled to settle or agree to pay in
full such claim or demand, in its sole discretion using reasonable business
judgment. For purposes of this Section 10.3, all notice requirements
hereunder with respect to the Baylor Litigation shall be deemed to have been
provided by Buyer upon entering into this Agreement.

10.4. _Insurance Proceeds_.

The amount of any indemnification payable in connection with any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall be net of any insurance proceeds
available under any insurance policies in effect at the time to a Buyer
Indemnified Person or a Genworth Indemnified Person, respectively, in
connection with the events or circumstances giving rise to the
indemnification.

10.5. _After-Tax Calculation_.

The amount of any indemnification payable in connection with any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall be (i) net of any federal or state Tax
benefit realized by the Indemnified Party by reason of the facts and
circumstances giving rise to the indemnification, and (ii) increased by the
amount of any federal or state Tax required to be paid by the Indemnified
Party on the accrual or receipt of the indemnification payment (including any
amount payable pursuant to this clause (ii)). For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the amount of any state Tax benefit or cost shall take into
account the federal Tax effect of such benefit or cost.

10.6. _Treatment of Indemnification; Certain Reserves_.

(a) The payment of any amount pursuant to the indemnification provisions of
this Agreement or pursuant to _Sections 7.3(c) and 7.4_  of this Agreement
shall be an adjustment of the Purchase Price.

(b) To the extent that Damages and any other costs or expenses incurred by
the Stock Sale Companies in connection with the defense and settlement of
Baylor Litigation following the Closing Date are in aggregate less than the
Baylor Reserve, Buyer will promptly pay to Genworth the difference between
the Baylor Reserve and such amount of Damages and costs and expenses.

10.7. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.

All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive
the Closing and shall terminate and expire at the close of business on
the two year anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, that (a) the
representations and warranties in _Sections 3.5_ (Capital Stock of the Stock
Sale Companies), _3.4_ (Authorization) and _4.2_ (Authorization) shall survive
the Closing indefinitely and (b) the representations and warranties in
_Sections 3.12_ (Employee Benefits) and _7.1_ (Tax Representations) shall
survive the Closing until six months after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (taking into account any applicable extensions or
tollings thereof). All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement,
shall survive the Closing until fully performed or otherwise expiring by their
terms hereunder.



 

76 10.8. _Exclusivity of Rights and Procedures_.

Except as set forth in _Article VII_ of this Agreement, and subject to each
partyÂ’s right to seek specific performance pursuant to  _Section 11.17_ and
to pursue any claim with respect to fraud or intentional misrepresentation,
the indemnification provided in this _Article X_ shall be the exclusive
remedies of each of the Genworth Indemnified Persons and the
Buyer Indemnified Persons for any claim any of them may have, whether
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, relating in whole or in part, to the
matters specified in _Section 10.1(a)_ or _Section 10.2(a)_ hereof other
