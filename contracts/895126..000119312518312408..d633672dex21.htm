Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). As a result of the Merger, the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
its existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as the surviving
corporation (in such capacity, the Company is sometimes referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ").

2.2 _Closing_.

 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ "), shall take place at 9:00
a.m., Houston, Texas time, on a date that is two (2) Business Days following
the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver in
accordance with this Agreement of all of the conditions set forth in _Article_
__ _ VII_ (other than any such conditions which by their nature cannot be
satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied
or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived in accordance with this
Agreement on the Closing Date) at the offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. in
Houston, Texas, or such other place as Parent and the Company may agree in
writing. For purposes of this Agreement " _Closing Date_ " shall mean the date
on which the Closing occurs.

 

(b) As soon as practicable on the Closing Date after the Closing, a
certificate of merger prepared and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") shall be
filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective upon the filing and acceptance of the
Certificate of Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, or at such later time as shall be agreed upon in writing by
Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 

2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. 

2.4 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, the Organizational
Documents of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall continue to be the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter amended, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_, in
accordance with their respective terms and applicable Law.

 

2.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The Parties shall
take all necessary action such that from and after the Effective Time, the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, and such directors and officers shall serve until
their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Organizational

2.6 _Organizational Documents of Parent_.

 

(a) Subject to the approval by Parents stockholders of the Parent Charter
Amendments prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary
actions to cause the Parent Charter Amendments to become effective at or
immediately following the Effective Time, and Parents restated certificate of
incorporation, as amended by the Parent Charter Amendments, shall be
the certificate of incorporation of Parent until thereafter amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

(b) Subject to the approval by Parents stockholders of the Parent Board Size
Charter Amendment prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary
actions to cause the amended and restated bylaws of Parent to be amended as of
the Effective Time so that such bylaws shall provide that the size of the
Parent Board shall be no more than eleven (11) members.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary corporate
action so that upon and after the Effective Time, one person designated by the
Company prior to the Closing (the " _First Company Director_ ") is appointed
to the Parent Board. Parent, through the Parent Board, shall take all
necessary action to nominate the First Company Director for election to the
Parent Board in the proxy statement relating to the first annual meeting of
the stockholders of Parent following the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Proxy
Statement_ "). The First Company Director must be reasonably acceptable to
Parent; provided that any current director of the Company shall be deemed
reasonably acceptable to Parent, without requiring any further approval from
Parent.

(d) If (i) the Parent Board Size Charter Amendment has been approved by
Parents stockholders prior to the Effective Time or (ii) following the
Effective Time a vacancy occurs on the Parent Board, then in either case,
Parent shall take all necessary corporate action so that upon and after the
Effective Time (if the Parent Board Size Charter Amendment has been
approved), or as promptly as practicable following the first vacancy on the
Parent Board, the First Company Director and a second person designated by the
Company prior to the Closing (the " _Second Company Director_ ") are
appointed to the Parent Board. Parent, through the Parent Board, shall take
all necessary action to nominate, subject to the approval of the Parent Board
Size Charter Amendment or the existence of a vacancy on Parents Board, the
Second Company Director for election to the Parent Board in the Post-Closing
Proxy Statement. The Second Company Director must be reasonably acceptable to
Parent; provided that any current director of the Company shall be
deemed reasonably acceptable to Parent, without requiring any further
approval from Parent.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
expressly acknowledge that approval by Parents stockholders of the Parent
Charter Amendments is not a condition to any partys obligation to complete
the Transactions.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties, the First Company
Director and the Second Company Director.

2.7 _Post-Closing Merger_. Immediately following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall merge with and into LLC Sub (the " _LLC Sub
Merger_ "), with LLC Sub continuing as the surviving entity in such merger as
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, pursuant to a merger agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ (the " _LLC
Sub Merger Agreement_ "). At the time of and immediately after the LLC Sub
Merger, Parent shall own all of the membership interests and other equity, if
any, in LLC Sub and shall be the sole member of LLC Sub, and LLC Sub shall be
treated as an entity disregarded as separate from Parent for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes.

 

ARTICLE III

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND

MERGER SUB; EXCHANGE

 

3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, or any holder of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and shall represent one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article_ __ _ III_, each share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any shares of Company Common Stock described in _clause_ __ _
(iii)_ of this  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_), including for the avoidance of
doubt any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time whose prior restrictions have lapsed pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 3.2_, shall be converted automatically at the Effective Time into the right
to receive from Parent (such consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

 

(A) For each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive mixed consideration has been made and not revoked or lost pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, (1) that number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Mixed Exchange Ratio and (2) $3.00
in cash (the " _Cash Portion_ "), without any interest thereon and subject to
any withholding Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 3.3(i) _(the " _Mixed Consideration_ "). As used in this Agreement, "
_Mixed Exchange Ratio_ " means 5.336.

(B) For each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election
to receive only share consideration has been made and not revoked or lost
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, that number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "
_Share Consideration_ "). As used in this Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ "
means 5.989.

 



7

    

(C) For each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which no
election to receive the Share Consideration or Mixed Consideration has been
made, the Share Consideration.

(ii) All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall cease
to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Each
holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock
described in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)(iii)_) shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration, (B)
any dividends or other distributions in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.3(g)_ and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_, in each case to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the exchange of any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 3.3(a)_.

 

(iii) All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
shares or by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of
Company Common Stock held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
(other than Merger Sub) or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into
such number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Share Consideration.

 

(c) _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc._ Without limiting the Parties respective
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, in the event
of any change in (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock, or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock or (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Parent Common Stock (including options to purchase Parent Common Stock), in
each case issued and outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Effective Time by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination,
exchange of shares or the like, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect the effect of such change and, as so adjusted,
shall from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration,
subject to further adjustment in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_.

 

3.2 _Treatment of Restricted Stock Awards_.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding award of
restricted Company Common Stock (the " _Restricted Stock_ ") granted pursuant
to the Companys 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time
(the " _Company Stock Plan_ "), shall immediately vest in full and any
forfeiture restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock shall immediately
lapse and, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, each share of Restricted Stock shall be treated as a share of
Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
vesting.

 



8

    

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board and/or the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board shall take such action and adopt such
resolutions as are required to effectuate the treatment of Restricted Stock
pursuant to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, and to take all actions
reasonably required to effectuate any provision of this _Section_ __ _ 3.2_,
including to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver any Company Capital
Stock to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of any equity awards of the
Company.

3.3 _Payment for Securities; Exchange_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
enter into an agreement with the Companys transfer agent, or another firm
reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent, to act as agent for the
holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger Consideration and cash sufficient to pay
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ to which
such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ III_. On
the Closing Date and prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article_ __ _ III_ through the Exchange Agent, (i) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holders and (ii)
sufficient cash to make delivery of the Cash Portion to such holders, in each
case pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_. Parent agrees to make available to the
Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_. The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued in exchange for shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_ and _Sections_ _3.3(g)_ and
_3.3(h)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash
and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent
(including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 3.3(g)_) shall be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of
the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company
Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Any interest or other income
resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall
become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable hereunder shall, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, of (A) an outstanding certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time 

 



9

    

 represented shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B)
shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ "), in each case, which shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, a letter of
transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
Letter of Transmittal, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to
by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)(i)_.

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ (after taking into account
all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time) and (B) a check in an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of cash, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_ and this _Article_ __ _ III_, including cash payable in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.3(h)_ and dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(g)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration, cash in
lieu of fractional shares or any unpaid dividends and other distributions
payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the record
holder of such shares of Company Common Stock, it shall be a condition of
payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or Parent that such Taxes either
have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_.

(c) _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration, dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(g)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ paid upon the surrender of and in
exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of
this

 



10

    

 Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed
immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing shares
of Company Common Stock described in _clause_ __ _ (ii)_ of  _Section_ __ _
3.1(b)_), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and
any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_, without any interest thereon.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the 180th
day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
former common stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore received
the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_
and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_, in each case
without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this _Article_ __ _
III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for such
amounts.

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for
any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If
any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the
time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other than
a Certificate evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in _clause_
__ _ (iii)_ of _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_) shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and
any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_.

 



11

    

(g) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with
respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be
entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to any such holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
3.3_. Following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, there
shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.
For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of
Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates or scrip or
shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account and aggregating all Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the aggregate
net cash proceeds as determined below and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of
which is such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock, and the
denominator is the number of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting a
portion of the Exchange Fund as represents the aggregate of all fractional
entitlements of all holders of Company Common Stock. As promptly as possible
following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall sell at then-prevailing
prices on the NYSE such number of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting
a portion of the Exchange Fund as represents the aggregate of all fractional
entitlements of all holders of Company Common Stock, with the cash proceeds
(net of all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sales) of such
sales to be used by the Exchange Agent to fund the foregoing payments in lieu
of fractional shares (and if the proceeds of such share sales by the Exchange
Agent are insufficient for such purpose, then Parent shall promptly deliver to
the Exchange Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the deficiency
required to make all such payments in lieu of fractional shares). The payment
of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding-off of the fractions in the exchange.

 



12

    

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement such amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code or any similar provisions of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are so
properly deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority
by Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

3.4 _Election Procedures_.

 

(a) Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Effective Time or
on such other date as Parent and the Company mutually agree (the " _Mailing
Date_ "), Company shall cause to be mailed an election form and other
appropriate and customary transmittal materials, in such form as Company shall
reasonably specify and as shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent (the "
_Election Form_ "), to each record holder of Company Common Stock (other than
shares of Company Common Stock described in _clause_ __ _ (iii)_ of _Section_
__ _ 3.1(b)_) as of a record date that is five (5) Business Days prior to
the Mailing Date or such other date as mutually agreed to by Parent and the
Company.

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through customary documentation and instructions) of Company Common Stock to
specify (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which
such holder elects to receive the Share Consideration, (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to
receive the Mixed Consideration or (iii) that such holder makes no election
with respect to such holders shares of Company Common Stock. Any shares of
Company Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent does not receive
a properly completed Election Form during the period (the " _Election Period_
") from the Mailing Date to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business
Day that is two Business Days prior to the Closing Date or such other date as
Parent and the Company shall, prior to the Closing, mutually agree (the "
_Election Deadline_ ") shall be deemed to have made no election. Parent and
the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election Deadline at least
five business days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. If the Closing Date
is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly
delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the Company shall promptly
announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election
Deadline.

 

(c) Company shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders or
beneficial owners of Company Common Shares during the Election Period, and
Parent shall provide the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary
for it to perform its duties as specified herein.

 

(d) Any election made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form during the Election Period. Any Election Form
may be revoked or changed by the person submitting it, by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent during the Election Period. In the event an
Election Form is revoked during the Election Period, the Shares represented by
such Election Form shall be deemed to have made no election, except to the
extent a subsequent election

 



13

    

 is properly made during the Election Period. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election
Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any
Person of any defect in an Election Form.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this
Agreement and delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior
to the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and except
as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (including all exhibits and
schedules thereto publicly filed with the SEC) filed with or furnished to
the SEC and available on Edgar prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding
any disclosures set forth in any such Company SEC Documents in any risk factor
section, any forward-looking statement disclosure or any other statements that
are non-specific, predictive, or cautionary in nature other than historical
facts included therein), where the relevance of the information as an
exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a particular representation is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

4.1  _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly
organized, as the case may be, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, with all requisite
entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted, other than, in the case of the
Companys Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized or to have such
power, authority or standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company (a
" _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "). Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the operation,
ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such qualification
necessary, other than where the failure to so qualify or be in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to
Parent complete and correct copies of its Organizational Documents, as well
as the equivalent Organizational Documents of each Subsidiary, in each case as
of the date of this Agreement.

 

4.2 _Capital Structure_.

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of (i) 500,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and (ii)

Preferred Stock_ " and, together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company
Capital Stock_ "). At the close of business on October 26, 2018: 101,996,339
shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding and 435,000 shares

(b) All outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock have been duly authorized
and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are not subject to
preemptive rights. All outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock have been
issued and granted in compliance in all material respects with (i) applicable
securities Laws and other applicable Law and (ii) all requirements set forth
in applicable contracts. As of the close of business on October 26, 2018,
except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ and pursuant to the
Company Certificate of Designations, there are no outstanding options,
warrants or other rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries any Company Capital Stock or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Company Capital Stock
(and the exercise, conversion, purchase, exchange or other similar price
thereof). All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Subsidiaries of the
Company that are owned by the Company, or a direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company, are free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than
Permitted Encumbrances, and have been duly authorized and are validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable. Except for the Preferred Stock or as set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 4.2_, and except for changes since October 26, 2018
resulting from the exercise of stock options outstanding at such date (and the
issuance of shares thereunder), or stock grants or other awards granted in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(ii)_, there are outstanding: (A) no
shares of Company Capital Stock, (B) no Voting Debt, (C) no securities of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of Company Capital Stock or Voting Debt, and (D) no
options, warrants, calls, rights (including preemptive rights), commitments or
agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party
or by which it is bound in any case obligating the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company to issue, deliver, sell, purchase, redeem or acquire, or cause
to be issued, delivered, sold, purchased, redeemed or acquired, additional
shares of Company Capital Stock or any Voting Debt or other voting securities
of the Company, or obligating the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to
grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment
or agreement. Other than the Stockholders Agreement, there are not any
stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound relating to the
voting of any shares of the Company Capital Stock or any equity interest in

Company has no (1) material joint venture or other similar material equity
interests in any Person or (2) obligations, whether contingent or otherwise,
to consummate any material additional investment in any Person other than its
Subsidiaries and its joint ventures listed on _Schedule 4.2_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 



15

    

4.3 _Authority; No Violations; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and

more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, title (as of the date of this

have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve estimates of Parent set forth in the

Parent Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve estimates fairly
reflect, in all respects, the oil and gas reserves of Parent at the dates
indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Except
for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and

knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision of, or taken
or failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease
(or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas
Lease) included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries.

(d) All material proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil
and Gas Properties of Parent and its Subsidiaries are being received by them
in a timely manner and are not being held in suspense (by Parent, any of its

reason other than awaiting preparation and approval of division order title
opinions for recently drilled Wells. Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries is
obligated by virtue of a take-or-pay payment, advance payment, or similar
payment (other than royalties, overriding royalties and similar arrangements

Gas Properties at some future time without receiving payment therefor at the
time of delivery, except, in each case, as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

information or data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries made by

substantive correspondence and, with respect to substantive oral
communications, a summary of such correspondence or communications, between:
(x) on the one hand, the Company or any of their Representatives; and (y) on
the other hand, the Person that made or submitted such Company Competing
Proposal or any Representative of such Person.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company,
directly or indirectly through one or more of its Representatives, may:

Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of this  _Section_ __ _
6.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no non-public information that is
prohibited from being furnished pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_ may be
furnished until the Company receives an executed confidentiality agreement
from such Person containing limitations on the use and disclosure of non-
public information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company
that are (A) no less favorable to the Company and (B) no less restrictive to
the Person making the Company Competing Proposal in the aggregate than the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided,_   _further_ , that such
confidentiality agreement does not contain provisions that prohibit the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_ or that otherwise prohibits the Company from complying
with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, and (B) prior to taking any
such actions, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company
Competing Proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Superior Proposal and, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to engage in such activities would be inconsistent with
the Company Boards duties under applicable Law;

(iii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response
to a Company Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, if the Company Board so chooses, cause the Company to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation or to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, if prior to taking such action
(A) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that
such Company Competing Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal (taking into
account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger proposed by
Parent in response to

 



57

    

 such Company Competing Proposal), (B) the Company Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to
do so would be inconsistent with the Company Boards duties under applicable
Law and (C) the Company shall have given notice to Parent that the Company has
received such proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
proposal, and, that the Company intends to take such action, and either (1)
Parent shall not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement prior to the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the third (3rd) Business Day after the date on which
such notice is given to Parent, or (2) if Parent within the period described
in the foregoing _clause (1)_ shall have proposed revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would form a binding contract if
accepted by the Company, the Company Board, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good
faith that the Company Competing Proposal remains a Company Superior Proposal
with respect to Parents revised proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that each
time material modifications to the financial terms of a Company Competing
Proposal determined to be a Company Superior Proposal are made the time
period set forth in this _clause (C)_ prior to which the Company may effect a
Company Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement shall be extended
for twenty-four (24) hours after notification of such change to Parent; and

(iv) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, seek
clarification from (but not engage in any negotiations with or provide any
non-public information to) any Person that has made a Company Competing
Proposal solely to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such
proposal to provide adequate information for the Company Board to make an
informed determination under _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)(ii)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a
Company Intervening Event that occurs or arises after the date of this
Agreement, the Company may, if the Company Board so chooses, effect a Company
Change of Recommendation if prior to taking such action (i) the Company Board
(or a committee thereof) determines in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards duties under applicable Law, (ii) the
Company shall have given notice to Parent that the Company has determined
that a Company Intervening Event has occurred or arisen (which notice will
reasonably describe such Company Intervening Event) and that the Company
intends to effect a Company Change of Recommendation, and either (A) Parent
shall not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement prior to the earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the third (3rd) Business Day after the date on which
such notice is given to Parent, or (B) if Parent within the period described
in _clause (A)_ shall have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by
the Company, the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, shall have determined in good faith that such proposed changes do
not obviate the need for the Company Board to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation and that the failure to make a Company Change of Recommendation
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards duties under applicable Law.

 



58

    

(g) During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the Effective Time and
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company
shall not (and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; provided, that,
notwithstanding any other provision in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, prior to,
but not after, the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if, in
response to an unsolicited request from a third party to waive any
"standstill" or similar provision, the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards duties under
applicable Law, the Company may waive any such "standstill" or similar
provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a
Company Competing Proposal, on a confidential basis, to the Company Board and
communicate such waiver to the applicable third party; provided, however, that
the Company shall advise Parent at least two Business Days prior to
taking such action. The Company represents and warrants to Parent that it has
not taken any action that (i) would be prohibited by this _Section_ __ _
6.3(g)_ or (ii) but for the ability to avoid actions in breach of
the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law, would have been prohibited by this _Section_ __
_ 6.3(g)_ during the 30 days prior to the date of this Agreement.

referred to as a " _Parent Change of Recommendation_ ").

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall promptly advise
the Company of the receipt by Parent of any Parent Competing Proposal made on

connection with a Parent Competing Proposal or any request for discussions or
negotiations with Parent or a Representative of Parent relating to a Parent
Competing Proposal (in each case within one Business Day thereof), and Parent

6.5 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration Statement_.

 

(a) Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and information
relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and the holders of
its capital stock, as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of
including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the adoption
by its stockholders of this Agreement. The Company will promptly furnish to
Parent such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and the
holders of its capital stock, as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose
of including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto.

shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC a
mutually acceptable Joint Proxy Statement relating to the matters to be
submitted to the holders of Company Capital Stock at the Company Stockholders
Meeting and the holders of Parent Common Stock at the Parent Stockholders
Meeting, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration
Statement (of which the Joint Proxy Statement will be a part). The
Company and Parent shall each use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the rules
and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff. Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the
Securities Act as soon after such filing as practicable and Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective as long
as is necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will
advise the other promptly after it receives any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or any request by the SEC for
additional information. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the
SEC in connection with the Transactions to comply as to form and substance in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the
Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing

Company and Parent will (i) provide the other with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed
final version of such document or response), (ii) shall include in such
document or response all comments reasonably proposed by the other and (iii)
shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving
the approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



61

    

(c) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
and applicable blue sky laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each
Party will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, or the suspension
of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of the Company and
Parent will use reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

 

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company and Parent.

 

6.6 _Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the declaration of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement and the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by the SEC. Except
as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the Company Board shall recommend that
the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Company Board shall
solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement, and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the
effect that the Company Board has made the Company Board Recommendation. The
Companys obligations to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ shall not
be limited or otherwise affected by the making, commencement, disclosure,
announcement or submission of any Company Superior Proposal or Company
Competing Proposal, or by any Company Change of Recommendation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders
Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys
stockholders or (B) if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Capital Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct business at such Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may, and at
Parents request shall, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled,
there are insufficient shares of Company Capital Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the Company
Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is
more than

 



62

    

 twenty (20) Business Days after the date for which the meeting was
previously scheduled (it being understood that such Company Stockholders
Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances
described in the foregoing _clauses_ __ _ (i)(A)_ and _(i)(B)_ exist, and
such Company Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing  _clause (ii)_ exist); and
_provided_ _further_ that the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be

postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to a date no later than the second
(2nd) Business Day after the expiration of any of the periods contemplated
by  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)(iii)(C)_. If requested by Parent, the Company
shall promptly provide all voting tabulation reports relating to the Company
Stockholders Meeting that have been prepared by the Company or the
Companys transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative, and shall
otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the status of the
solicitation and any material oral or written communications from or to the
Companys stockholders with respect thereto. Unless there has been a Company
Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the Parties
agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against any
efforts by any of the Companys stockholders or any other Person to prevent
the Company Stockholder Approval from being obtained. Once the Company has
established a record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company
shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for
the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless required to do so by applicable Law or its Organizational Documents or
in connection with a postponement or adjournment permitted hereunder.

(b) Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Laws
and the Organizational Documents of Parent to duly give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by the SEC. Except as
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, the Parent Board shall recommend that the
stockholders of Parent vote in favor of the issuance of Parent Common Stock
in the Merger and the Parent Board shall solicit from stockholders of Parent
proxies in favor of such issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and
the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that
the Parent Board has recommended that the stockholders of Parent vote in
favor of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting. The Parent Board shall recommend that the
stockholders of Parent vote in favor of the Parent Charter Amendments and the
Parent Board shall solicit from stockholders of Parent proxies in favor of the

statement to the effect that the Parent Board has made the Parent Charter
Amendment Recommendation. Parents obligations to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Parent Stockholder Meeting in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the
making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Parent
Competing Proposal or by any Parent Change of Recommendation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent (i) shall be
required to adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting (A) to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the Parents stockholders or (B) if, as
of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Parent
Stockholders Meeting or (ii) may, and at the Companys request shall, adjourn
or postpone the

 



63

    

 Parent Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Parent
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Parent
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to
by the Parties, the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date that is more than twenty (20) Business Days after the
date for which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being understood that
such Parent Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time
the circumstances described in the foregoing  _clauses_ __ _ (i)(A)_and
_(i)(B)_ exist, and such Parent Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or
postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing _clause
(ii)_ exist); and _provided_   _further_ that the Parent Stockholders
Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date on or after two (2)
Business Days prior to the End Date. If requested by the Company, Parent shall
promptly provide all voting tabulation reports relating to the Parent
Stockholders Meeting that have been prepared by Parent or Parents transfer
agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative, and shall otherwise keep the
Company reasonably informed regarding the status of the solicitation and any
material oral or written communications from or to Parents stockholders with
respect thereto. Unless there has been a Parent Change of Recommendation in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, the Parties agree to cooperate and use
their reasonable best efforts to defend against any efforts by any of the
Parents stockholders or any other Person to prevent the Parent Stockholder
Approval from being obtained. Parent shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Parent Stockholders Meeting without
the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by
applicable Law or its Organizational Documents or in connection with a
postponement or adjournment permitted hereunder.

 

(c) The Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting on the same day.

(d) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall duly
approve and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub in accordance with applicable Law and the Organizational Documents
of Merger Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by
written consent so approving and adopting this Agreement.

 

6.7 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
the other Party and its Representatives, during the period prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ of this Agreement, reasonable access, at
reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers,
key employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of such Party
and its Subsidiaries and to their books, records, contracts and documents and
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably
promptly to the other Party and its Representatives such information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties, contracts, records
and personnel as may be reasonably requested, from time to time, by or on
behalf of the other Party. Each Party and its Representatives shall conduct
any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the other Party or its Subsidiaries or otherwise
cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by
the employees of the other Party and its Subsidiaries of

 



64

    

 their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_, neither Party shall be required to, or to cause any
of its Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information to the other
Party or any of its Representatives to the extent that such information is
subject to an attorney/client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine
or that such access or the furnishing of such information is prohibited by
applicable Law or an existing contract or agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Party shall not have access to personnel records of the other
Party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other information that in the other
Partys good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the other
Party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Party shall not be permitted to conduct any sampling or
analysis of any environmental media or building materials at any facility of
the other Party or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the
other Party, which may be granted or withheld in the other Partys sole
discretion. Each Party agrees that it will not, and will cause its
Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7(a)_ for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions and the financing of Parent and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time.

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of August 8, 2018 between Parent
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall survive the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and shall apply to all
information furnished thereunder or hereunder.

6.8 _HSR and Other Approvals_.

 

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to Antitrust Laws
to which _Sections_ _6.8(b)_ and _(d)_ , and not this _Section_ __ _
6.8(a)_, shall apply, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the
Parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental
Entities all authorizations, Consents, notifications, certifications,
registrations, declarations and filings that are necessary in order to
consummate the Transactions and shall diligently and expeditiously prosecute,
and shall cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of, such matters.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following
the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall make any filings required under
the HSR Act. As promptly as reasonably practicable, the Parties shall make any
filings and notifications as may be required by foreign competition laws
and merger regulations (the " _Competition Law Notifications_ "). Each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings
under any applicable Antitrust Laws. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt
expiration of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any
Competition Law Notifications. Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply with any request for
information from any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying,
administering, or investigating the HSR Act, any Competition Law Notifications
or any other Law designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the
purpose or effect of mergers, monopolization, restraining trade or abusing
a dominant position (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "),

 



65

    

 including the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, any
attorney general of any state of the United States, the European Commission or
any other competition authority of any jurisdiction (" _Antitrust Authority_
"). Parent and the Company shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from any Antitrust Authority. In the event that any action is threatened or
instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be necessary to
avoid, resist or resolve such action. Parent shall be entitled to direct any
Proceedings with any Antitrust Authority or other Person relating to any of
the foregoing, _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall afford the Company a
reasonable opportunity to participate therein. In addition, in the event that
any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any Proceeding that would make
consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and all steps necessary to
vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such
consummation prior to the End Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_ or otherwise in this Agreement, in no event
shall Parent be required to (i) defend, commence or threaten to commence any
lawsuits or legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, (ii) agree
to hold separate, divest, license, or take or commit to take any action that
limits in any respect its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability
to retain, or cause a third party to purchase, any of the assets, businesses,
products, rights, services, or licenses, of the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates, or any interest therein, (iii) extend any
waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC,
the DOJ or other Governmental Body not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than a timing agreement negotiated with
the relevant agency, which is of normal and reasonable scope and duration,
except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, or (iv)
otherwise agree to any restrictions on the businesses of Parent or Company or
any of their respective Affiliates in connection with this _Section_ __ _
6.8_.

(c) The Parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected
from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine,
joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.8_ so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub shall not take any action that could reasonably be
expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of
the required waiting period under the HSR Act, any Competition Law
Notifications or any other applicable Antitrust Law.

6.9  _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Parent
shall cause each individual who is employed as of the Closing Date by the
Company or a Subsidiary thereof (a " _Company Employee_ ") and who remains
employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation, LLC Sub or any of its Subsidiaries) to be provided with (i) base
compensation (salary or wages, as applicable), and as applicable, annual bonus
and incentive compensation (excluding equity compensation) opportunities at
target that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those in effect for
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee
benefits (including retirement plan participation) that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than those in effect for such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date, which employee benefits may be provided through
Company Plans and/or Parent Plans (such employee benefit plans, the " _Company
Employee Benefit Plans_ ").

 



66

    

(b) From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, the Company Employees
shall be given credit for all purposes under the Company Employee Benefit
Plans (other than with respect to any "defined benefit plan" as defined in
Section 3(35) of ERISA, retiree medical benefits or disability benefits or to
the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits) in which the Company
Employees participate, for such Company Employees service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries, including vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual
purposes, to the same extent and for the same purposes that such service was
taken into account under a comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, to give service credit for long term disability coverage
purposes for the Company Employees service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, subject to the approval
of the applicable insurance carrier, to (i) waive any limitation on health and
welfare coverage of any Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents
due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment
requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under the
applicable health and welfare Company Employee Benefit Plan to the same
extent such conditions, periods or requirements are satisfied or waived under
the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
credit the expenses of any Company Employee that were credited towards
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits under the applicable
Company Plan for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs against
satisfaction of any deductibles or out-of-pocket limits under the Company
Employee Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

 

(d) Prior to but conditioned upon the Closing, the Company shall, or shall
cause its Affiliate to, take action to (i) effect the termination of the
WildHorse Resources Management Company, LLC Contribution Plan (the " _401(k)
Plan_ ") and shall provide Parent with evidence of such termination and (ii)
fully vest the account balance of all Company Employees under the 401(k)
Plan. Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliate to, cause (x) a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan to accept a rollover of each Company Employees
account distributed from the 401(k) Plan and (y) each Company Employee to be
eligible to participate in such tax-qualified defined contribution plan as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

 

(e) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Company Employee is entitled during the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries will assume and honor all unused vacation and other paid time off
days accrued or earned by such Company Employee as of the Closing Date for
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be
construed as amending, any Company Plan or Parent Plan. The provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.9 _are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing
in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to
confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt,

 



67

    

 any Company Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or
any of their respective Affiliates), other than the Parties and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.9_) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement.

 

6.10 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect
on the date of this Agreement or otherwise, from the Effective Time and until
the six (6) year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary
under any Company Plan or any of its Subsidiaries and, solely to the extent
of any Existing Proceedings, each Person who controls or is alleged to
control, directly or indirectly, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against all losses, claims,
damages, costs, fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys and other
professionals fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that
are paid in settlement, of or incurred in connection with any threatened or
actual Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise
involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising,
in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person controls or controlled
or is alleged to control or have controlled, directly or indirectly, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any
Company Plan or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise or by reason of
anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity, whether
pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to, at or after
the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including all Indemnified
Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out
of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses incurred in connection
therewith in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to each
Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law).
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding is brought or
threatened to be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may retain
the Companys regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to
them, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as
statements therefor are received, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall use their best efforts to assist in the defense of any such
matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, upon learning of any
such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to
notify shall not relieve a Party from any obligations that it may have under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices such Partys position with respect to such claims). With respect to
any determination of whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification by Parent or Surviving Corporation under this _Section_ __ _
6.10_, such Indemnified Person shall have the right, as

 



68

    

 contemplated by the DGCL, to require that such determination be made by
special, independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and
approved by Parent or Surviving Corporation, as applicable (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and who has not otherwise
performed material services for Parent, Surviving Corporation or the
Indemnified Person within the last three (3) years.

 

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation in any manner that would affect (or manage the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would)
adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by
applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its
directors, officers or employees existing immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified
Person against all reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), such amounts to be
payable in advance upon request as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_,
relating to the enforcement of such Indemnified Persons rights under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_ or under any charter, bylaw or contract regardless of
whether such Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be entitled to
indemnification hereunder or thereunder.

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place, and
Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time, "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope (including with
regard to covered persons) at least as favorable as the Companys existing
policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may elect
in its sole discretion to, but shall not be required to, spend more than 300%
(the " _Cap Amount_ ") of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to
the date of this Agreement for the six (6) years of coverage under such "tail"
policy; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such insurance exceeds
the Cap Amount, and Parent elects not to spend more than the Cap Amount for
such purpose, then Parent shall purchase as much coverage as is reasonably
available for the Cap Amount.

 

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assignees (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of their
assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render Parent or
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this _Section_
__ _ 6.10_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Parties and each Person
entitled to indemnification or

 



69

    

 insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.10_, and his heirs and Representatives. The rights of the Indemnified
Persons under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ are in addition to any rights such
Indemnified Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Law. Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

 

6.11 _Agreement to Defend; Stockholder Litigation_. In the event any
Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced that
questions the validity or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in
connection therewith, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Party shall give each other Party the right to review and
comment on all material filings or responses to be made by any Party in
connection with any such Proceeding, and no settlement shall be agreed to or
offered without each Partys prior written consent.

6.12 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by the Parties. The Parties will not, and will cause their
Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other public
disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions without the prior
written approval of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party,
its Subsidiaries or their Representatives may issue a public announcement or
other public disclosures required by applicable Law or the rules of any stock
exchange upon which such Partys or its Subsidiarys capital stock is traded,
provided such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the other Party an
opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure
and provide reasonable comment regarding same; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no provision this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict in any manner a
Partys ability to communicate with its employees and that neither Party shall
be required by any provision of this Agreement to consult with or obtain any
approval from any other Party with respect to a public announcement or press
release issued in connection with the receipt and existence of a Company
Competing Proposal or a Parent Competing Proposal and matters related thereto
or a Company Change of Recommendation or a Parent Change of Recommendation
other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3_.

 

6.13 _Advice of Certain Matters; Control of Business_. Subject to compliance
with applicable Law, the Company and Parent, as the case may be, shall confer
on a regular basis with each other and shall promptly advise each other orally
and in writing of any change or event having, or which would be reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. Except
with respect to Antitrust Laws as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, the
Company and Parent shall promptly provide each other (or their respective
counsel) copies of all filings made by such Party or its Subsidiaries with
the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions. Without limiting in any way any Partys rights or
obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give any Party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
other Party and their respective Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Parties shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



70

    

6.14 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)(ii)_,
all Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the Transactions, if any, shall
be borne and paid by Parent when due, whether levied on Parent or any other
Person, and Parent shall file or caused to be filed all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to any such Transfer Taxes. The Parties
will cooperate, in good faith, in the filing of any Tax Returns with respect
to Transfer Taxes and the minimization, to the extent reasonably permissible
under applicable Law, of the amount of any Transfer Taxes.

6.15 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

 

(a) Except to the extent that the Parties obligations are specifically set
forth elsewhere in this _Article_ __ _ VI_, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including _Section_ __ _ 6.3_),
each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Merger Sub
shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon becoming aware of (i) any
condition, event or circumstance that will result in any of the conditions in
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or _7.3(a)_ not being met, or (ii) the failure by such
Party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.

6.16 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of Parent
(including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act.

6.17 _Listing Application_. Parent shall take all action necessary to cause
the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing
on the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, subject to official notice of

Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Article_
__ _ VIII_, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers and directors to, and shall instruct and use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives

relating to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations, for use in marketing, rating agency and offering documents,
and to enable Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements) as reasonably
requested by Parent to assist Parent in (i) the arrangement of any bank debt
financing (including through amendments to existing bank debt financings) or
any capital markets debt or equity financing and (ii) any tender offer or
consent solicitation in respect of outstanding senior notes of Parent.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers and directors to, after (and not prior to) the receipt of
a written request from Parent to do so, use reasonable best efforts to deliver
all notices and take all other actions to facilitate the termination at the
Closing of all commitments in respect of each of any credit agreement of the
Company, the repayment in full on the Closing Date of all obligations in
respect of the indebtedness thereunder, the release on the Closing Date of any

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_,

performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
of competent jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
9.11_, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
under the terms of this Agreement at law or in equity. Each Party accordingly
agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy

breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 9.11_. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any

presiding over such action or until such action is otherwise resolved.

 

9.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at any time
before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company,
but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Law would
require the further approval by such stockholders without first obtaining
such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

9.13  _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and Parent may, by action taken or authorized by their respective

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
Party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement; or

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
Party contained in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent
in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right under this Agreement. No agreement on the
part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid unless set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.
