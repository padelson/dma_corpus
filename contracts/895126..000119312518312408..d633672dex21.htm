Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account and aggregating all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the aggregate net cash proceeds as
determined below and (ii)&nbsp;a fraction, the numerator of which is such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock, and the denominator is the number of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting a portion of the Exchange Fund as represents
the aggregate of all fractional entitlements of all holders of Company Common Stock. As promptly as possible following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall sell at then-prevailing prices on the NYSE such number of shares of Parent Common
Stock constituting a portion of the Exchange Fund as represents the aggregate of all fractional entitlements of all holders of Company Common Stock, with the cash proceeds (net of all commissions, transfer taxes and other <FONT

fractional shares). The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">bargained-for</FONT> consideration but merely represents a mechanical
