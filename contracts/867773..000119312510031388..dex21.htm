to be held in escrow until the Final Company Working Capital has been

Note Consideration Shareholder_ ") a second Company Shareholder Note in the

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.3,
Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise
payable in accordance with this Agreement to any Company Shareholder such
amounts as Purchaser is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any applicable Tax law or any other applicable
Laws. As of the date hereof, other than (i) such payments required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to any Israeli taxpayer participants in the
SunRay Malta Holdings Limited Share Plan, (ii) payments to any U.S. Person
that has not provided to Purchaser a properly completed U.S. Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9, and (iii) payments to a Person other than a U.S.
Person of interest on the Company Shareholder Notes, any portion of the
Interest Amount, and, deemed interest or original issue discount for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as to which, in each case, the recipient has not
provided to Purchaser a properly completed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form
certifying the recipients entitlement to exemption from withholding,
Purchaser is not aware of any amounts payable in accordance with this
Agreement to any Company Shareholder that it would be required to so deduct
and withhold. If after the date hereof but prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser becomes aware of any amounts payable in accordance with this
Agreement to any Company Shareholder that Purchaser would be required to so
deduct and withhold, Purchaser shall provide notice of such deduction or
withholding to such Company Shareholder not less than two Business Days prior
to the Closing to allow such Company Shareholder the opportunity to provide
forms or certifications that would allow for a reduction or exemption from any
such withholding; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Purchaser 



 

23  becomes aware of such amounts less than two Business Days prior to the
Closing, Purchaser shall provide such notice to such Company Shareholder prior
to the Closing. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Tax Authority by Purchaser, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company
Shareholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall (i) the aggregate
amount of cash and principal amount of the Company Shareholder Notes payable
to the Company Shareholders at the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.3(a)
(after giving effect to the provisions of Section 2.3(b)) plus (ii) the
Company Indemnification Amount plus (iii) the Working Capital Escrow Amount
exceed the Adjusted Purchase Price.

(b) _Escrow Payment_. Deliveries to the Escrow Agent shall be made, in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, by and
among Purchaser, U.S. Bank National Association, as escrow agent (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ") and the Company Shareholders, substantially in the form
attached hereto as  _Exhibit J_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Letter of
Credit and the Company Shareholder Notes shall be deposited by Purchaser with
the Escrow Agent to fund the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, in lieu of depositing the Letter of Credit
with the Escrow Agent, Purchaser may deposit cash in an amount equal to the
Stated Amount (without regard to the interest component) with the Escrow Agent
to fund the Escrow Fund, and in such event, Purchaser, the Escrow Agent and
the Company Shareholders shall agree on an alternate form of escrow agreement,
which shall be substantially similar to the Escrow Agreement (with such
changes as are necessary to reflect the substitution of cash for the Letter
of Credit as the form of escrow consideration thereunder). Upon such
agreement, such alternate form shall be attached hereto as Exhibit J, and
shall become the "Escrow Agreement" for purposes of this Agreement. The
Escrow Fund shall be distributed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement and Section 2.5 and Article 9 of this Agreement. To the maximum
extent possible, the Company Shareholder Note to be deposited with the Escrow
Agent on behalf of any Class C Note Consideration Shareholder shall represent
the portion of the combined aggregate principal amount of the Company
Shareholder Notes that is the last to be repayable to such Company Shareholder
pursuant to the terms of such Company Shareholder Note.

(c) Payment of all cash consideration to the Class A Holder and the Class
B Holders shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available U.S.

Share Plan (the " _Trustee_ ") as specified by such Company Shareholder in its
Side Agreement, or in the case of the EBT Trustee, in the EBT Trustee
Resolution, or such other account of the Trustee designated in writing by such
Company Shareholders or the EBT Trustee at least two (2) Business days prior
to the Closing, and the Company Shareholder Notes to be issued to each Class
C Note Consideration Shareholder shall be issued in the name of such Class C
Note Consideration Shareholder.

Consideration Shareholder set forth on _Schedule X_ ) shall have the right to
elect, exercisable by providing written notice of such election to Purchaser
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, that all of the

Shareholder Note shall be an amount of Euros equal to the product of (x) the

of the other provisions contained in this Agreement.

Shareholder Note to be denominated in British Pound Sterling instead of U.S.
dollars, (ii) the principal amount of such Company Shareholder Note shall be
an amount of British Pound Sterling equal to the product of (x) the principal
amount, in U.S. dollars, that such Company Shareholder Note would have been
absent such election and (y) 1.56, and (iii) such Company Shareholder Note
shall be deemed to have a principal amount equal to the principal amount,

A Holders calculation thereof. Any Shareholders Company Working Capital
Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail those items or amounts as
to which the Class A Holder disagrees and the basis for disagreement. All
items and amounts contained in Purchasers Company Working Capital Calculation
that are not disputed in the Shareholders Company Working Capital Objection
Notice shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in
this Section 2.5, and all amounts relating to such non-disputed portion of the
Working Capital Escrow (not including any portion of the Working Capital
Cushion that may be required to cover any disputed amounts, which shall
remain in escrow) shall be paid out to the Company Shareholders and Purchaser,
as applicable. If the Class A Holder does not deliver the Shareholders
Company Working Capital Objection Notice within the Shareholders
Company Working Capital Objection Period, the parties will be deemed to have
agreed in all respects with Purchasers Company Working Capital Calculation
and it shall be deemed the final calculation of Company Working Capital.

(f) If a Shareholders Company Working Capital Objection Notice shall be
timely delivered, and if Purchaser and the Class A Holder do not mutually
resolve the objections within ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of
such Shareholders Company Working Capital Objection Notice, then Purchaser
and the Class A Holder shall jointly engage Ernst and Young, or such other firm
of independent, internationally recognized accountants, having no material
relationship with Purchaser, the Company, any Subsidiary or any Company
Shareholders, unless waived by Purchaser and the Class A Holder in writing,
as shall be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and the Class A Holder (the "
_Arbitrating Accountant_ "), as arbitrator, and cause the Arbitrating
Accountant to promptly review this Section 2.5, the definitions of the terms
used herein, the applicable Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the disputed
items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the final Company Working
Capital. In making such calculation, the Arbitrating Accountant shall consider
only those items or amounts in Purchasers Company Working Capital
Calculation as to which the Class A Holder has, in the Shareholders Company
Working Capital Objection Notice, disagreed and such other issues as may
reasonably be affected by the items as to which the Class A Holder has
disagreed. The Arbitrating Accountant shall deliver to Purchaser and the Class
A Holder, as promptly as practicable, a written report setting forth its
calculation of the disputed items. In no event shall the Arbitrating
Accountants determination result in a calculation of final Company Working
Capital that is (i) greater than the Class A Holders calculation set forth in
the Shareholders Company Working Capital Objection Notice, or (ii) less than
Purchasers Company Working Capital Calculation. Absent manifest error, such
report shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant shall be allocated to and borne 50/50
by Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company Shareholders (pro rata), on the
other hand.



 

27 (g) Each party hereto will cooperate and, to the extent requested, assist in
the preparation of the final calculation of the Company Working Capital and
in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section 2.5, including (i)
Purchaser making available to the extent reasonably necessary or helpful any
books, records, work papers and personnel of the Company and the Subsidiaries
related to the Company Working Capital, and (ii) each of the Company
Shareholders making available to the extent reasonably necessary or helpful
any books, records, work papers and personnel of the Company and the Company
Shareholders. The final Company Working Capital, determined in accordance with
this Section 2.5, shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Final
Company Working Capital_." 

(h) Within five days following the determination of the Final Company Working
Capital, adjustments shall be paid in accordance with _Annex A_.

the rights of the Company or any Subsidiary in any Company IP Right or
portion thereof. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is paying any

Subsidiary has received any written notice (or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any oral notice) asserting that any IP Right or the conduct of the

former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary.

rights therein, to the Company or one of the Subsidiaries. All current

remain in effect as of the Closing, and such Company Shareholder has not
granted any rights to purchase, and has no obligation to transfer, assign or

any restrictions on Purchasers transfer under applicable securities Laws).

Shareholder did not avail itself of that opportunity prior to signing this
Agreement and 



 

56  the Related Agreements, that such Company Shareholder did so voluntarily

legal or Tax advice will not be used by such Company Shareholder as a defense
to the enforcement of such Company Shareholders obligations under this
Agreement or any of the Related Agreements. Such Company Shareholder
understands that it must rely solely on its own advisors and not on any
statements or representations by other Company Shareholders, the Company, any
Subsidiary, Purchaser or any of their respective agents. Such Company
Shareholder understands that it (and not Purchaser, the Company or any
Subsidiary) shall be responsible for its own legal or Tax liability that may
arise as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Related Agreements.

other legal Basis whatsoever.

Company Shareholders knowledge, threatened against or affecting such Company
Shareholder that would prevent such Company Shareholder from (a) executing and
delivering this Agreement or the Related Agreements or (b) performing such
Company Shareholders obligations pursuant to, or observing any of the terms
and provisions of, this Agreement or the Related Agreements.

4.7 _No Conflict_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or

Shareholder to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or
the Related Agreements.

and effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any
party thereto or their respective officers, directors, shareholders limited
partners, Affiliates or affiliated investment funds after such termination.

(d) Each Company Shareholder hereby agrees, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, to take all further actions as shall be
necessary to give effect to the foregoing Sections 6.13(a), (b) and (c).

6.14 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) Until the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser will not, nor
will it permit any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to, take any action to
amend any provision of the memorandum or articles of association (or other
comparable corporate charter documents) of the Company or any Subsidiary that
provides for indemnification of directors, officers or employees (including an
amendment effected through a merger, consolidation, sale of all
or substantially all the assets, liquidation or dissolution of any such
entity), if the effect of such amendment would be to adversely affect the
rights provided thereby to any Person who shall have served as a director or
officer of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date in respect
of actions taken in such capacity on or prior to the Closing Date, unless such
Person would immediately thereafter be entitled to indemnification by
Purchaser or another subsidiary of Purchaser comparable to that provided by
the affected provision prior to any such amendment.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall procure and the Company shall
purchase or cause to be purchased, at the Companys expense, an extended
reporting period for directors and officers and fiduciary liability policies
covering each present or former director and officer of the Company and each
Subsidiary for a period of six years following the Closing Date, such extended
reporting period to be based upon the Companys directors and officers
liability and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof.
For the avoidance of doubt, the terms, conditions and policy limits of such
extended reporting period shall be identical to the terms, conditions and
policy limits of the Companys directors and officers liability and
fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof.

6.15 _Covenants Relating to Certain Indebtedness_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall take all such actions as shall be
necessary to cause the Permitted Indebtedness identified on _Schedule G_ ,
together with all accrued interest, fees and other expenses payable thereon,
to be paid in full effective as of the Closing, and at the Closing shall pay
or cause such amounts to be so paid in full and shall procure for the
applicable evidence customary "payoff letters" in connection therewith.



 

69 (b) At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser and the Company shall take all such
actions as shall be necessary to terminate all of the guarantees or other
forms of credit or financial support provided to the Company, the Subsidiaries
or any Project Company by the Class A Holder or any of its Affiliates or
Principal Shareholder Indemnified Persons effective as of the Closing
(without cost or liability to Class A Holder of any of its Affiliates or
Principal Shareholder Indemnified Persons) and of no further force or effect,
except that, with respect to guarantees or other forms of credit or financial
support that are provided for the benefit of Persons other than Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, a customary "pay off letter", in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Class A Holder may be delivered at the Closing
with the full termination actions of similar effect to be completed by
Purchaser and the Company promptly after the Closing.

(c)

(i) The Company has delivered to Purchaser its budget for the operation
of the Company from February 28, 2010 through March 26, 2010 (such budget, as
may be modified by the Company from time to time with the prior consent of
Purchaser and the Class A Holder, and which is set forth in _Schedule W,_
the " _Post-February 28 Budget_").

(ii) On or prior to February 28, 2010, the Class A Holder and the Company
shall arrange for additional borrowings during March (the " _March Debt_ ") by
the Company from Citibank under the Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended,
dated as of November 2, 2009, by and among Denham Commodity Partners Fund V
LP, a Delaware limited partnership, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent and
letter of credit issuer and the Lender described therein, in an amount
sufficient to fund the Post-February Budget and on terms, including interest
rate and drawing mechanics, substantially similar to those offered to the
Company in connection with its existing 14,000,000 credit facility with
Citibank. Any March Debt shall be included within clause (iv) of the
definition of Permitted Indebtedness, and be deemed as listed on _Schedule G_
for purposes of paragraph (a) above.

(iii) During the period from February 28, 2010 and continuing until the later
of (A) the Closing Date or (B) March 26, 2010, the Company shall not make
expenditures that, in the aggregate exceed the aggregate amount budgeted for
the period covered by the Post-February 28 Budget without the prior consent
of Purchaser and the Class A Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably
delayed or withheld. During such period, each of Purchaser and the Class A
Holder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Citibank
promptly provides the Company with all funds necessary to make such
expenditure in a timely fashion.

(iv) During the period from February 28, 2010 and continuing until the earlier
of the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
defer any receivables from the Company or any Subsidiary, unless otherwise
permitted by the Class A Holder.



 

70 6.16 _Tax Matters_.

(a) After the Closing, the Company shall prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, all Tax Returns for the Company and each Subsidiary not
previously filed. All such Tax Returns that may relate to potential Pre-
Closing Tax Liabilities shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent
with prior practice, except as required, in the reasonable judgment of
Purchaser, to cause such Tax Returns to comply with applicable Tax Law and
avoid the imposition of any penalty, and except as required by a change in Tax
Law or a change in the interpretation of substantial authority previously
relied upon by Company or a Subsidiary. The Company shall deliver all such
Tax Returns that may relate to potential Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities to the
Class A Holder not less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date, with any
extensions, therefor for the Class A Holders review and comment. The Class A
Holder shall provide the Company with any such comments within fifteen (15)
days following delivery of the Tax Returns to the Class A Holder. The Company
shall consider any of the Class A Holders comments in good faith and the
parties shall work together to finalize all Tax Returns with respect to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods in a manner acceptable to both parties. If the Company and
the Class A Holder are unable to resolve any dispute regarding the filing of
a Tax Return that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Liability, the Parties shall
retain an independent accounting firm acceptable to both parties, and whose
fees shall be borne equally by both parties, to determine the most
appropriate manner to complete and file such Tax Return, and any such Tax
Return shall be prepared or revised to reflect the determination of the
independent accountants. Unless required by Law, Purchaser will not amend or
refile, and will cause the Company and each Subsidiary not to amend or refile,
any Tax Return filed by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to
the Closing Date without the Class A Holders consent, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser shall procure that any written information
received by Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary from any Tax Authority or
any of their respective employees in relation to the matters set forth on 
_Schedule P_ or _Schedule Q_ , including copies of notices, claims and
correspondence, is promptly provided to the Class A Holder.

(b) Neither Purchaser, Company, nor any Subsidiary shall make any election,
and Purchaser shall ensure that no such election is made, under section 338 of
the Code or any similar provision of Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Purchaser and Company Shareholders agree that indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated as Purchase Price adjustments for
Tax purposes to the extent allowable without penalties under applicable Law.

6.17 _Notification of Certain Events_. The Company shall promptly notify
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall promptly notify the Company and the Company
Shareholders, of any change, occurrence or event, which individually or in
the aggregate with any other changes, occurrences and events, is reasonably
likely to cause any of its conditions to closing set forth in Article 7 not to
be satisfied.

6.18 _Consideration_. Each Company Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that
(i) true, correct and complete copies of the provisions of Section 4.1 and
4.3 of the Company Shareholders Agreement and Article 103 of the Company
Articles are set forth on _Exhibit R_ , and that Sections 4.1(b) through (d)
of the Company Shareholders Agreement and Articles 103.4 and 103.5 of the
Company Articles, in each case as so attached, shall be used to determine the
allocation to the Company Shareholders of the Adjusted Purchase Price and any
distributions to 



 

71  the Company Shareholders from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 2.5(h),
(ii) he, she or it has read such provisions and agrees that the allocation set
forth with respect to such Company Shareholder in the Spreadsheet correctly
show how such provisions operate and should be interpreted given the
assumptions set forth therein, (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the Company Shareholders Agreement or the Company Articles, any
amounts available to be drawn under or distributed from the Letter of Credit
and the principal amount of each Company Shareholder Note shall be treated as
cash for purposes of such provisions and allocations and (iv) the Acquisition
constitutes a "Complete Exit" as defined in the Company Shareholders Agreement
after giving effect to the amendment to the Company Shareholders Agreement
described in Section 6.13.

6.19 _Issuer Note Guarantee_.

(a) In order to induce certain Class C Holders to accept promissory notes
issued by SunPower North America, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(the " _Issuer_ "), for a portion of the Adjusted Purchase Price payable to
such Class C Holders under this Agreement (the " _Issuer Notes_ "), Purchaser
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and
not merely as a surety, to each holder from time to time of the Issuer Notes
(whether or not such holder is a Class C Holder on the date hereof) and the
successor and assigns of any such holder (" _Issuer Note Holder_ ") (i) the
obligation of the Issuer to pay the principal of and interest (including
interest accruing during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership or other similar proceeding, regardless of whether allowed or
allowable in such proceeding) on the Issuer Notes, when and as due, whether
at maturity, by acceleration, upon one or more dates set for prepayment or
otherwise, and (ii) all other monetary obligations, including fees, costs,
expenses and indemnities, whether primary, secondary, direct,
contingent, fixed or otherwise (including monetary obligations incurred
during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other
similar proceeding, regardless of whether allowed or allowable in such
proceeding), in each case when and as due, of the Issuer under the Issuer
Notes (the " _Obligations_ "). Purchaser further agrees that the due and
punctual payment of the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in
part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain
bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or
renewal of any Obligation.

(b) Purchaser waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the
Issuer of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its
obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of
Purchaser hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any Issuer
Note Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy
against the Issuer under the provisions of this Agreement, the Issuer Notes or
otherwise; (ii) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (iii) any
rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement, the Issuer Notes or any other
agreement; (iv) the failure or delay of any Issuer Note Holder to exercise
any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Obligations; (v) the
failure of any Issuer Note Holder to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any remedy under any other agreement or instrument; (vi) any default, failure
or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or
(vii) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might
in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of Purchaser or otherwise
operate as a discharge of Purchaser as a matter of law or equity or which
would impair or eliminate any right of Purchaser to subrogation, in each case,
other than payment in full of the Obligations.



 

72 (c) Purchaser further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a
promise of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar
proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the
Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection.

(d) The obligations of Purchaser hereunder shall not be subject to any
reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall
not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or
termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of
the Obligations or otherwise, in each case, other than the defense of payment
in full of the Obligations.

(e) Purchaser further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to
be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or
any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored
by any Issuer Note Holder upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Issuer
or otherwise.

(f) In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right
which any Issuer Note Holder may have at law or in equity against Purchaser
by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Issuer to pay any Obligation when
and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after
notice of prepayment or otherwise, Purchaser hereby promises to and will
forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Issuer Note Holders in cash an
amount equal the unpaid principal amount of such Obligation. Purchaser further
agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a
currency other than Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York
and if, by reason of any legal prohibition, disruption of currency or foreign
exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such
Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible
or, in the reasonable judgment of any Issuer Note Holder, not consistent with
the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of such
Issuer Note Holder, Purchaser shall make payment of such Obligation in
Dollars (based upon the applicable spot exchange rate in effect on the date of
payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify such Issuer Note Holder
against any losses or expenses (including losses or expenses resulting from
fluctuations in exchange rates) that it shall sustain as a result of such
alternative payment.

(g) Upon payment in full by Purchaser of any Obligation of the Issuer, each
Issuer Note Holder shall, in a reasonable manner, assign to Purchaser the
amount of such Obligation owed to such Issuer Note Holder and so paid, such
assignment to be pro tanto to the extent to which the Obligation in question
was discharged by Purchaser, or make such disposition thereof as Purchaser
shall direct (all without recourse to any Issuer Note Holder and without any
representation or warranty by any Issuer Note Holder). Upon payment by
Purchaser of any sums as provided above, all rights of Purchaser against the
Issuer arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise
shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the
prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by the Issuer
to the Issuer Note Holders (it being understood that, after the discharge of
all the Obligations due and payable from the Issuer, such rights may be
exercised by Purchaser notwithstanding that the Issuer may remain contingently
liable for indemnity or other Obligations).



 

73 (h) For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser does not waive and may assert as an
affirmative defense, in an action to enforce Purchasers guarantee hereunder,
any and all contractual defenses to enforcement available to the Issuer under
the Issuer Notes as expressly provided therein for reductions caused by any
Trigger Event (as defined therein) or claim against the Escrow Fund and for
performance of the Issuer Notes.

the extent that any such event or condition arises out of or results from any
action or failure to act on the part of Purchaser or its Affiliates or any of

8.1 _Termination_. At any time prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be
terminated and the Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated hereby
may be abandoned, as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and the Class A Holder;

(b) by either Purchaser or the Class A Holder, if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before April 30, 2010 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(b) shall not be available to any party (including for this purpose, in the
case of the Class A Holder, the Company and each of the Company Shareholders)
who is in material breach of this Agreement and such breach of this Agreement
has resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Termination Date;

(c) by either Purchaser or the Class A Holder, if any permanent injunction or
other order of a court or other competent Government Entity preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have
become final and nonappealable; 

(d) by Purchaser, if the Company or any Company Shareholders shall have
materially breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein
and (i) such breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Company or the Class A Holder of written notice of such breach
( _provided_ , _however_ , that no such cure period shall be available or
applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot be cured) and (ii) if
not cured at or prior to the Closing, such breach would result in the failure
of any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.3 to be satisfied (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the termination right under this Section 8.1(d)
shall not be available to Purchaser if Purchaser is at that time in material
breach of this Agreement); or

(e) by the Class A Holder, if Purchaser shall have materially breached any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein and (i) such breach
shall not have been cured within thirty days after receipt by Purchaser of
written notice of such breach ( _provided_ , _however_ , that no such cure
period shall be available or applicable to any such breach which by
its nature cannot be cured) and (ii) if not cured at or prior to the Closing,
such breach would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 or 7.2 to be satisfied ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) shall not be available
to the Class A Holder if any Company Shareholders or the Company is at that
time in material breach of this Agreement).

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall
be no liability or obligation on the part of Purchaser or the Company or their
respective officers, directors, shareholders or Affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each party hereto shall remain liable for any Willful Breach
of this Agreement prior to its termination; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Prior NDA, Section 3 (Non-Solicitation) of the Prior Letter Agreement and
the provisions of Sections 1.1, 6.4, 6.6 and 8.2 and Article 10 shall remain
in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the 



 

76  foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1
after a Closing Delay Event Date, and between the Closing Delay Event Date and
the date of termination any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 that
were satisfied cease to be satisfied, then the aggregate amount that the
Company or any Company Shareholder may recover from Purchaser for any breach
of this Agreement related to the failure of such conditions to be satisfied
shall not exceed the aggregate amount of costs and expenses that were actually
and reasonably incurred by the Company or such Company Shareholder, as the
case may be, in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement. 

8.3 _Amendment_. The parties hereto may amend this Agreement at any time in
accordance with an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. In
addition, Purchaser and the Class A Holder jointly (on behalf of all other
parties, including the Company and the Company Shareholders) may cause this
Agreement to be amended at any time by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of Purchaser and the Class A Holder jointly (on behalf of all
other parties, including the Company and the Company Shareholders) and such
amendment shall be binding on all parties hereto as if they were signatories
to such amendment; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such amendment may change
the form or amount of consideration payable to any Company Shareholder (other
than the Class A Holder) pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise materially
and adversely affect the rights or obligations, under this Agreement or any
Related Agreement, of any Company Shareholder (other than the Class A Holder)
disproportionately compared to all other Company Shareholders (including
the Class A Holder)) (it being understood and agreed that any allocation of
amounts in accordance with Sections 4.1 and 4.3 of the Company Shareholders
Agreement and Article 103.5 of the Company Articles shall not be deemed to
disproportionately affect any Company Shareholder), without the written
consent of Company Shareholders so adversely affected who held in the
aggregate immediately prior to the Closing at least seventy-five percent (75%)
of the outstanding Shares held immediately prior to the Closing by all of the
Company Shareholders so adversely affected (it being acknowledged and agreed,
for the avoidance of doubt, that any amendment contemplated in any such
written consent shall be binding on all Company Shareholders (other than the
Class A Holder) as if all such Company Shareholders executed such written
consent).

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. The Class A Holder and Purchaser jointly (on behalf
of all parties, including the Company and the Company Shareholders) may, to
the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to any party herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions for the benefit of any party contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such extension or waiver may change the form or amount of
consideration payable to any Company Shareholder (other than the Class A
Holder) pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise materially and adversely
affect the rights or obligations, under this Agreement or any Related
Agreement, of any Company Shareholder (other than the Class A Holder)
disproportionately compared to all other Company Shareholders (including the
Class A Holder)) (it being understood and agreed that any allocation of
amounts in accordance with Sections 4.1 and 4.3 of the Company Shareholders
Agreement and Article 103.5 of the Company Articles shall not be deemed to
disproportionately affect any Company Shareholder), without the written
consent of Company Shareholders so adversely affected who held in the
aggregate immediately prior to the Closing at least seventy-five percent (75%)
of the outstanding Shares held immediately prior to 



 

77  the Closing by all of the Company Shareholders so adversely affected (it
being acknowledged and agreed, for the avoidance of doubt, that any extension
or waiver contemplated in any such written consent shall be binding on all
Company Shareholders (other than the Class A Holder) as if all such Company
Shareholders executed such written consent). Any party may waive any of its
rights under this Agreement by a written instrument signed by such party. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto, or by the Class A Holder on behalf of
other holders, to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Without
limiting the generality or effect of the preceding sentence, no delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such
right, and no waiver of any breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any
other breach or default of the same or any other provision in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 9

ESCROW FUNDS AND INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 _Escrow Fund_. Subject to the provisions of this Article 9, from and after
the Closing, each Principal Shareholder shall indemnify and hold harmless
Purchaser, each subsidiary of Purchaser and their respective managers,
officers, directors, agents and employees, subsidiaries, directors and
employees of subsidiaries, and each Person, if any, who controls or may
control Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act (each of
the foregoing, which for the avoidance of doubt shall not include any Company
Shareholder, a " _Purchaser Indemnified Person_ ") for such Principal
Shareholders Indemnification Percentage of any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims, suits, settlements, royalties, fines,
penalties, reasonable costs and expenses, including costs of investigation,
settlement, and defense and reasonable legal fees, court costs, and any
interest costs or penalties (collectively, " _Losses_ "), arising out of,
related to or otherwise by virtue of (a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in Article 3 or any of the
Related Agreements to which the Company is a party, in each case, other than
any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.9 and other than the
Excepted Company Representations, (b) any of the matters set forth on
_Schedule O_ , (c) the matter set forth on _Schedule P_ , (d) the matter set
forth on _Schedule Q_ , (e) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation
or warranty made by the Company in Section 3.1(a)(iii), the last sentence of
Section 3.1(a), the first sentence of Section 3.1(c), Sections 3.1(d), (e)
and (f), Section 3.2 and Section 3.3(a) (the " _Excepted Company
Representations_ "), (f) any breach or default by the Company of any of the
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or any of the Related
Agreements to which it is a party, or (g) any Taxes of the Company and any
Taxes of any Person that at or before the time of Closing is a Subsidiary,
which Taxes are attributable to any period (whether or not a taxable period)
ending on or prior to the Closing (or, that in the event that a Closing Delay
Event has occurred, on or prior to the Closing Delay Event Date) whenever
asserted or assessed, including after the Closing, other than Taxes incurred
solely in respect of the matters set forth on _Schedule P_ or _Schedule Q_
(the " _Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities_ "), and in addition, and for the
avoidance of doubt, Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities shall include interest
accruing on any Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities regardless of whether such
interest accrues prior to or after the Closing or the Closing Delay Event
Date. Losses claimed pursuant to Sections 9.1(c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) are
sometimes hereinafter referred to as " _Escrow Specified Losses_." For the
avoidance of doubt, all payments for Losses that arise out a claim made
pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall, in accordance with Section 9.8, first be
payable from the Escrow Fund and, subject to the limitations contained in
Section 9.3, then by the Principal 



 

78  Shareholders, but only to the extent that such Principal Shareholders are
liable for such Losses. The parties agree that the sole indemnification of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for Losses attributable to Taxes is provided in
Sections 9.1(b) (to the extent described in item 3 on _Schedule O_ ), (c),
(d), and (g).

9.2 _Indemnification of Indemnified Persons_.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article 9, from and after the Closing,
each Company Shareholder shall, severally but not jointly, indemnify and hold
harmless each Purchaser Indemnified Person from and against Losses arising out
of, related to or otherwise by virtue of (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty made by such Company Shareholder contained in
Article 4 of this Agreement or any Related Agreement to which it is a party,
or (ii) any breach or default by such Company Shareholder of any
covenant, obligation or condition required to be performed or complied with
by such Company Shareholder under this Agreement or any Related Agreement to
which it is a party.

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Article 9, from and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each Principal Shareholder, each
subsidiary of each Principal Shareholder and their respective managers,
officers, directors, agents and employees, subsidiaries, directors and
employees of subsidiaries, and each Person, if any, who controls or may
control each Principal Shareholder within the meaning of the Securities
Act (each of the foregoing, a " _Principal Shareholder Indemnified Person_
"), and with respect to any breach of or inaccuracy in the Excepted Purchaser
Representations, the Company Shareholders, each subsidiary of each
Company Shareholder and their respective managers, officers, directors,
agents and employees, subsidiaries, directors and employees of subsidiaries,
and each Person, if any, who controls or may control each Company Shareholder
within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any and all Losses
arising out of, related to or otherwise by virtue of (i) any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty contained in Article 5 of this
Agreement or any Related Agreement, (ii) any breach of or default in
connection with any of the covenants or agreements made by Purchaser in this
Agreement or any Related Agreement, (iii) any Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary to the extent attributable to any period after the Closing, but
not including interest accruing after the Closing that is attributable to
Taxes for any period prior to the Closing, or (iv) any amounts payable after
the Closing Date (provided, that in the event that a Closing Delay Event has
occurred, after the Closing Delay Event Date) under the guarantees or other
forms of credits or financial support to be terminated pursuant to Section
6.15(b).

(c) For the purposes of Section 9.1 and this Section 9.2, in determining the
amount of any Losses in respect of any inaccuracy in or any breach of any
representation and warranty (but not for the purpose of determining whether or
not a breach has occurred), any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualification contained in such representation or warranty will in
all respects be ignored.

(d) In the case of any taxable period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of Pre-Closing Tax
Liabilities based on or measured by income or receipts (collectively, the "
_Closing of the Books Taxes_ ") shall be based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date, for this purpose
treating any transactions outside the ordinary course of business that occur
on the 



 

79  Closing Date but after the Closing as occurring on the day after the
Closing, and the amount of any Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities that are not
Closing of the Books Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Purchaser
has elected to postpone the Closing in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10.14 of this Agreement, references in this Section 9.2(d) to the
"Closing Date" shall mean the Closing Delay Event.

(e) If any amount is to be distributed to the Purchaser Indemnified Persons
from the Escrow Fund with respect to a resolved claim in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement, then such amount shall be paid by reduction of amounts
available to be drawn under the Letter of Credit and cancellation of principal
amount of Company Shareholder Notes pro rata in proportion to the
Indemnification Percentage of each Company Shareholder.

9.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) The Purchaser Indemnified Persons may not recover Losses from the Escrow
Fund or from the Company Shareholders in respect of any claim for
indemnification in accordance with Section 9.1(a) unless and until Losses in
accordance with Section 9.1(a) have been incurred, paid or properly accrued in
an aggregate amount greater than $2,500,000 (the " _Purchaser Indemnification
Deductible_ "). Once the Purchaser Indemnification Deductible has been
exceeded, the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover all
Losses in accordance with Section 9.1(a) in excess of the Purchaser
Indemnification Deductible, subject to the other limitations, terms and
conditions in this Article 9. No Loss may be claimed under Section 9.1(a) (or
counted against the Purchaser Indemnification Deductible) unless the Losses
resulting from any single claim or series of related claims arising out of the
same facts, events or circumstances exceeds $50,000.

(b) The Company Indemnified Persons may not recover from Purchaser in respect
of any claim for indemnification in accordance with Section 9.2(b)(i) unless
and until Losses in accordance with Section 9.2(b)(i) have been incurred,
paid or properly accrued in an aggregate amount greater than $2,500,000 (the "
_Company Indemnification Deductible_ "). Once the Company Indemnification
Deductible has been exceeded, the Company Indemnified Persons shall be
entitled to recover all Losses in accordance with Section 9.2(b)(i) in excess
of the Company Indemnification Deductible, subject to the other limitations,
terms and conditions in this Article 9. No Loss may be claimed under Section
9.2(b)(i) (or counted against the Company Indemnification Deductible) unless
the Losses resulting from any single claim or series of related claims arising
out of the same facts, events or circumstance exceeds
$50,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Indemnified Persons shall
be entitled to recover for, and the Company Indemnification Deductible and the
immediately foregoing sentence shall not apply as a threshold to, any Losses
with respect to any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
made by Purchaser in Section 5.1, Section 5.2 or Section 5.3 (each, an "
_Excepted Purchaser Representation_ ").



 

80 (c) Subject to Section 9.3(a), the aggregate liability of the Company
Shareholders for Losses shall be as follows, in each case to be satisfied in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.8:

representations or warranties made by a Company Shareholder contained in
Article 4 or in any Related Agreement to which such Company Shareholder is a
party (each, an " _Individual Representation_ ") claimed under Section
9.2(a)(i), or (B) breaches of or defaults by a Company Shareholder of any of
the covenants, obligations or agreements required to be performed or complied
with by such Company Shareholder and contained in Section 6.6, the first
sentence of Section 6.8 or Section 6.15 of this Agreement, or any Article of
this Agreement other than Article 6 (collectively, the " _Payment Covenants_
"), a Purchaser Indemnified Person may recover from the applicable Company
Shareholder all Losses arising out of such Company Shareholders breach,
inaccuracy or default up to the aggregate portion of the Adjusted
Closing Purchase Price received or to be received by such Company Shareholder
(less, in the case of any Class C Note Consideration Holder, any portion of
the principal amount of such Holders Company Shareholder Note that has been
canceled in accordance with the terms of such Company Shareholder Note);
_provided_ that in the case of fraud the foregoing limitation as to the
maximum amount shall not apply;

(ii) with respect to (A) breaches of or inaccuracies in any of the Excepted
Company Representations, or (B) breaches of or defaults by the Company of any
Payment Covenants required to be performed or complied with by the Company, a
Purchaser Indemnified Person may recover all of its Losses from each Principal
Shareholder pro rata based on their Indemnification Percentage up to an amount
equal to the portion of the Adjusted Purchase Price received or to be
received by such Principal Shareholder (less, in the case of any Class C Note
Consideration Holder, any portion of the principal amount of such Holders
Company Shareholder Note that has been canceled in accordance with the terms
of such Company Shareholder Note); _provided_ that in the case of fraud, the
foregoing limitation as to the maximum amount shall not apply;

of such Company Shareholder Note);

Adjusted Purchase Price received or to be received by such Principal
Shareholder (less, in the case of any Class C Note Consideration Holder, any
portion of the principal amount of such Holders Company Shareholder
Note that has been canceled in accordance with the terms of such Company
Shareholder Note);

(v) with respect to the matters set forth on _Schedule Q_ , a Purchaser
Indemnified Person may recover (i) eighty percent (80%) of the first
$5,000,000 of its Losses from each Principal Shareholder pro rata based on

81  Shareholder (less, in the case of any Class C Note Consideration Holder, any
portion of the principal amount of such Holders Company Shareholder Note that
has been canceled in accordance with the terms of such Company Shareholder
Note), and (ii) all of its Losses in excess of $5,000,000 from each Principal
Shareholder pro rata based on their Indemnification Percentage up to amount
equal to the portion of the Adjusted Purchase Price received or to be
received by such Principal Shareholder,

(vi) with respect to all Losses other than those set forth in the immediately
foregoing clauses (i)-(v), the Purchaser Indemnified Persons may recover all
of its Losses solely from, and up to, the consideration in the Escrow Fund
from time to time; and

(vii) In no event shall the aggregate Losses payable by any Company
Shareholder to Purchaser under this Article 9 exceed the amount equal to the
portion of the Adjusted Closing Purchase Price received or to be received by
such Company Shareholder (less, in the case of any Class C Note Consideration
Holder, any portion of the principal amount of such Holders Company
Shareholder Note that has been canceled in accordance with the terms of such
Company Shareholder Note), except that in the case of fraud by such Company
Shareholder the foregoing limitation as to maximum amount shall not apply.

(d) Subject to Section 9.3(b), the aggregate liability of Purchaser for Losses
shall be as follows:

(i) with respect to (A) breaches of or inaccuracies in any of the Excepted
Purchaser Representations, (B) breaches of or defaults by Purchaser of any
Payment Covenants required to be performed or complied with by Purchaser, or
(C) any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary to the extent attributable to
any period after the Closing, a Company Indemnified Person may recover all of
its Losses from Purchaser up to an amount equal to the Adjusted Purchase
Price; _provided_ that in the case of fraud the foregoing limitation as to the
maximum amount shall not apply;

(ii) with respect to (A) breaches of or inaccuracies in any representation or
warranty of Purchaser claimed under Section 9.2(b)(i), other than the
Excepted Purchaser Representations and (B) Losses claimed under Section
9.2(b)(ii) (other than those covered by clause (i) above), a Company
Indemnified Person may recover all of its Losses from Purchaser up to an
amount equal to $31,855,000; _provided_ that in the case of fraud the
foregoing limitation as to the maximum amount shall not apply; and

(iii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses payable by Purchaser
exceed an amount equal to the Adjusted Purchase Price, except that in the case
of fraud by Purchaser the foregoing limitation as to maximum amount shall not
apply.

(e) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, including in this Article
9, no party shall have any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
right or remedy against any other party in connection with any indemnification
obligation or any other liability to which such party may become subject under
or in connection with this Agreement; it being understood that nothing herein
shall limit the right of a party to recover from any other party the fees and
expenses that such other party has agreed to share pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.



 

82 (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of the Company
Shareholders or Purchaser for any liability that survives the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2 if the Acquisition is not consummated.

(g) No Indemnified Persons rights under this Article 9 shall be adversely
affected by any investigation conducted, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired), by such Indemnified Person at any time, whether before or
after the execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, or by the
waiver of any condition to Closing.

(h) In calculating any Losses there shall be deducted (i) any indemnification,
contribution or other similar payment actually recovered by the Indemnified
Person or any Affiliate thereof from any third Person with respect to the
subject of such Losses (including any insurance proceeds (net of any
deductible amounts)) and (ii) any amounts (x) that would otherwise result in a
duplicative recovery due to an adjustment made pursuant to the determination
of Final Company Working Capital or otherwise or (y) that is specifically
identified as a reserve on the face of the Company Balance Sheet and not in
the notes thereto, other than any reserve for the matters set forth on 
_Schedule O_ , _Schedule P_ or _Schedule Q_.

(i) No party shall have any liability for any special, exemplary or punitive
damages suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Persons or other Person.

(j) Except in the case of common law fraud and as otherwise expressly
provided in Section 10.15 and except for remedies under the Company
Shareholder Notes, the Escrow Agreement and the Letter of Credit, the remedies
provided in this Article 9 shall, after the Closing, be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to the Indemnified Persons for any claim or cause
of action arising out of, in connection with or under this Agreement, the
Related Agreements, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

(k) Subject to the limitations set forth on _Schedule R_ , each party shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the amount of any Losses
for which it may seek recovery under this Article 9 with respect to the
matters set forth on _Schedule R_.

(l) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event will any Purchaser Indemnified Person be entitled to recover, or make
a claim for, any Losses from any of the Company Shareholders to the extent
that such Losses result from either (i) any action taken or failed to be
taken by Purchaser or its Affiliates or any of its or their respective
subcontractors or any other Person performing work or providing services to
the Company, the Subsidiaries or any Project Company at the direction of or
under the supervision or responsibility of Purchaser and its Affiliates, in
each case, in the course of EPC Work performed or to be performed, or (ii)
Purchasers breach of its obligations under Section 6.15(c).

9.4 _Escrow Claim Period_. The period during which claims for indemnification
from the Escrow Fund may be initiated (the " _Escrow Claim Period_ ") shall
commence at the Closing Date and terminate on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, at the conclusion of the Escrow Claim Period, such portion of the
Escrow Fund as shall equal the aggregate amounts set forth in any unresolved
or unsettled claims for Losses set forth in Claims Notices delivered to the
Escrow Agent prior to the 



 

83  expiration of the Claim Period (or otherwise set forth in certificates
provided for in the Escrow Agreement) shall remain in the Escrow Fund until
such claims for all such Losses have been resolved or satisfied, and the
remaining portion of the Escrow Fund shall be released to the Company
Shareholders. For the purpose of compensating any Purchaser Indemnified Person
for any Losses pursuant to this Article 9, each Company Shareholder Note in
the Escrow Fund shall be valued at its principal amount.

9.5 _Claims for Indemnification_.

(a) After an Indemnified Person becomes aware of any claim such Indemnified
Person has under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 that might result in a Loss (a "
_Liability Claim_ "), such Indemnified Person shall with reasonable promptness
deliver a notice of such Liability Claim (a " _Claims Notice_ ") (i) in the
case of a Liability Claim under Section 9.1, to the Principal Shareholders
and the Escrow Agent, (ii) (A) in the case of a Liability Claim under Section
9.2(a) or (B) for fraud (the " _Excluded Items_ "), to the applicable
Company Shareholder(s) (with a copy to the Class A Holder), or (iii) in the
case of a Liability Claim under Section 9.2(b), to Purchaser.

(b) A Claims Notice shall (i) be signed by an officer or other authorized
Person of the Indemnified Person (or in the case that the Indemnified Person
is an individual, by such Individual), (ii) state that an Indemnified Person
has incurred, paid or properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it may
incur, pay or properly accrue, Losses, (iii) state the amount of such Losses
(which, in the case of Losses not yet incurred, paid or properly accrued,
shall be a good faith estimate of those anticipated to be incurred, paid or
properly accrued), and (iv) specify in reasonable detail (based upon the
information then possessed by such Indemnified Person) the individual items
of such Losses included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to
which such Losses are related.

(c) No delay in or failure to give a Claims Notice by an Indemnified Person to
the Indemnifying Person pursuant to this Section 9.5 will adversely affect any
of the rights or remedies that the Indemnified Person has under
this Agreement or alter or relieve the Indemnifying Person of their
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Persons, except and to the extent that
(i) the Claims Notice is not provided within the applicable time limit set
forth in Section 9.4 or (ii) such delay or failure has actually prejudiced
the Indemnifying Person.

9.6 _Objections to Claims_. 

(a) The Class A Holder, and solely the Class A Holder, may object (with the
costs of pursuing the objections hereunder to be shared by all Principal
Shareholders proportionately based on their Indemnification Percentage) to any
Liability Claim set forth in a Claim Notice delivered in accordance with
Section 9.5(a)(i) by delivering written notice to Purchaser (with a copy to
the Company Shareholders and the Escrow Agent) of its objection.

(b) The applicable Company Shareholder may object to any Liability Claim set
forth in a Claim Notice delivered in accordance with Section 9.5(a)(ii) by
delivering written notice to Purchaser (with a copy to the Class A Holder) of
its objection.



 

84 (c) Purchaser may object to any Liability Claim set forth in a Claims Notice
delivered in accordance with Section 9.5(a)(iii) by delivering written notice
to the Company Shareholder that delivered the Claim Notice (with a copy to the
Company Shareholders) of its objection.

(d) Any notice delivered pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above shall be
referred to herein as an " _Objection Notice_." Any Objection Notice must
describe the grounds for such objection in reasonable detail. If an Objection
Notice is not delivered by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person
that delivered the Claim Notice (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if a Claims
Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent) within sixty (60) days after
delivery by the Indemnified Person of the Claims Notice (the " _Objection
Period_ "), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment
by the Indemnifying Persons that the Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification under Section 9.1 or 9.2 for the full amount of the Losses set
forth in such Claims Notice.

9.7 _Resolution of Objections to Claims_.

(a) If the Indemnifying Person shall object in writing to any claim or claims
made in any Claims Notice to recover Losses from the Indemnifying Person in
accordance with Section 9.6, the Indemnified Person shall have sixty (60)
days after its receipt of the Objection Notice to respond (with a copy to each
of the Company Shareholders, Purchaser and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent)
in a written statement to such objection (such sixty-day period, the "
_Response Period_ ").

(b) If after the expiration of the Response Period there remains a dispute as
to any claims, the Indemnified Person and Indemnifying Person shall attempt in
good faith for thirty (30) days thereafter to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims.

(c) If no agreement can be reached after good-faith negotiation and after
thirty (30) days after the expiration of the Response Period, either
Purchaser or the Class A Holder (or in the case of a Liability Claim with
respect to an Excluded Item, the applicable Company Shareholder(s)) may
institute arbitration to resolve the dispute in accordance with the
arbitration provisions of Section 10.12 and the decision of the arbitrator
regarding such claims shall be binding and conclusive on the parties to this
Agreement.

9.8 _Payment of Claims_.

(a) If a Claims Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent and no Objection
Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent within the Objection Period, or an
Objection Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent within the Objection Period
but such Objection Notice was only with respect to a portion of the Losses
claimed in the Claims Notice, the amount available to be drawn under the
Letter of Credit by the Escrow Agent and the aggregate principal amount of the
Company Shareholder Notes held in the Escrow Fund shall be reduced
proportionally based on the respective Indemnification Percentages having a
value equal to (i) the amount of the Losses set forth in such Claims Notice,
if no Objection Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent, or (ii) the amount
of the portion of the Losses set forth in such Claims Notice to which no 



 

85  objection was made, if an Objection Notice was delivered to the Escrow Agent
and, if such Losses specified in clauses (i) or (ii) were Escrow Specified
Losses and if such reduction in the amount available to be drawn under the
Letter of Credit and the aggregate principal amount of the Company Shareholder
Notes from the Escrow Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all such Losses,
each Principal Shareholder obligated to indemnify Purchaser (on behalf of
itself or any other Purchaser Indemnified Person) shall promptly wire transfer
to Purchaser an amount of cash equal to its Indemnification Percentage of the
value of any amount by which the Escrow Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy
all such Losses, subject to any applicable limitations in Section 9.3(c);
_provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent that the amount of the Losses set
forth in the Claims Notice (or portion thereof) is an estimate,
the Indemnified Persons shall not be so entitled to receive, and the Escrow
Agent shall not deliver, funds in respect of such portions of such estimated
Losses unless and until the amount of such estimated Losses is finally
determined.

(b) If (i) a Claims Notice was delivered directly to one or more Company
Shareholders in the case of a Liability Claim under Section 9.2(a) (an "
_Individual Claim_ ") and no Objection Notice was delivered to Purchaser by
such Company Shareholder(s) within the Objection Period, or (ii) a Claims
Notice was delivered directly to one or more Company Shareholders in the case
of an Individual Claim within the Objection Period but such Objection Notice
was only with respect to a portion of the Losses claimed in the Claims Notice,
then promptly, and in no event later than ten (10) days after expiration of
the Objection Period, each such Company Shareholder shall wire transfer to
Purchaser the applicable portion of the amount of such Losses set forth in the
Claims Notice for which such Company Shareholder is responsible under Section
9.2, subject to any applicable limitations in Article 9; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the amount of the Losses stated in the Claims Notice (or
any portion thereof) is an estimate, then such Company Shareholder(s) will
be required to make such payment within five days after the date that the
amount of Losses is finally determined.

(c) If (i) a Claims Notice was delivered to Purchaser and no Objection Notice
was delivered to the Class A Holder within the Objection Period, then
promptly, and in no event later than ten (10) days after expiration of the
Objection Period, Purchaser shall wire transfer to the Company Indemnified
Person(s) the amount of such Losses set forth in the Claims Notice from which
Purchaser is responsible under Section 9.2 subject to any applicable
limitations in Article 9;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the amount of the
Losses stated in the Claims Notice (or any portion thereof) is an estimate,
then Purchaser will be required to make such payment within five (5) days
after the date that the amount of Losses is finally determined.

(d) If an Objection Notice is delivered within the Objection Period:

(i) In the case of Losses claimed under Section 9.1, if an agreement between
the Class A Holder and Purchaser is reached during the Response Period or in
accordance with Section 9.7(b) or otherwise, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by each of Purchaser and the Class A
Holder. A copy of the memorandum setting forth the agreement shall be
delivered to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and shall reduce the amount available to be drawn under
the Letter of Credit and the aggregate principal amount of the Company
Shareholder Notes in the Escrow Fund as soon as practicable in accordance
with the terms of such memorandum. In addition, if such Losses were Escrow
Specified Losses and if the value of 



 

86  the reduction in the amount available to be drawn under the Letter of Credit
and the aggregate principal amount of the Company Shareholder Notes from the
Escrow Fund set forth in such memorandum is insufficient to fully satisfy all
such Losses, each Company Shareholder from which Purchaser (on behalf of
itself or any other Purchaser Indemnified Person) seeks recovery (without
duplicative recoveries) shall promptly wire transfer to Purchaser an amount
of cash equal to its Indemnification Percentage of the value of any amount by
which the Escrow Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all such Losses,
subject to any applicable limitations in Section 9.3(c).

(ii) In the case of an Individual Claim, if an agreement between the
applicable Company Shareholder(s) and Purchaser is reached during
the Response Period or in accordance with Section 9.7(b) or otherwise, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by each
of such Company Shareholder(s) and Purchaser. Within ten (10) Business Days of
the date of such memorandum, such Company Shareholder(s) shall wire transfer
to Purchaser (on behalf of the applicable Indemnified Person(s)) the amount of
cash agreed to be delivered to Purchaser (on behalf of the applicable
Indemnified Person(s)) in the memorandum.

(iii) In the case of Losses claimed under Section 9.1, if a determination is
made through arbitration in accordance with Sections 9.7(c) and Section
10.12, a copy of the determination shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such decision and, in accordance
with Section 9.2(e), shall reduce the amount available to be drawn under the
Letter of Credit and the aggregate principal amount of Company Shareholder
Notes in the Escrow Fund as soon as practicable from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of such determination. In addition, if such Losses
are Escrow Specified Losses, and if the value of the reduction in the amount
available to be drawn under the Letter of Credit and the aggregate principal
amount of the Company Shareholder Notes from the Escrow Fund set forth in
such determination is insufficient to fully satisfy all such Losses, each
Company Shareholder from which Purchaser (on behalf of itself or any other
Purchaser Indemnified Person) seeks recovery shall, subject to any applicable
limitations in Section 9.3(c), promptly wire transfer to Purchaser an amount
of cash equal to the amount by which such Losses exceed the value of such
distributions.

(iv) In the case of an Individual Claim, if a determination is made through
arbitration in accordance with Sections 9.7(c) and Section 10.12, within ten
(10) Business Days of such determination the applicable Company
Shareholder(s) shall deliver an amount of cash to Purchaser in accordance with
the terms of such determination.

(v) In the case of a Liability Claim under Section 9.2(b), (i) if an agreement
between Purchaser and the applicable Indemnified Person(s) is reached during
the Response Period or in accordance with Section 9.7(b) or otherwise, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by each
and within ten (10) Business Days of the date of such memorandum, Purchaser
shall wire transfer to the applicable Indemnified Person(s) the amount of
cash agreed to in the memorandum and (ii) if a determination is made through
arbitration in accordance with Sections 9.7(c) and Section 10.12, within ten
(10) Business Days of such decision Purchaser shall, subject to any
applicable limitations in Section 9.3(d)(ii), deliver an amount of cash to the
applicable Indemnified Persons in accordance with the terms of such
determination.



 

87 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
Shareholders do not have any individual right to object to any claim made in
a Claims Notice under this Article 9 (except for an Individual Claim, and then
only the Company Shareholder(s) to whom such Claims Notice was delivered shall
have the individual right to object in accordance with this Article 9) and,
except as aforesaid, any and all claims made in Claims Notice on behalf of the
Indemnified Persons may be objected to only by the Class A Holder.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.8, if
any Principal Shareholder that is a Class C Note Consideration Holder is
required to pay any amount under this Section 9.8, then such amount shall be
paid as follows: such Principal Shareholder shall promptly wire transfer to
Purchaser an amount of cash up to the amount received by such Principal
Shareholder under Article 2 of this Agreement prior to such time, and, in the
event that such amount of cash so received is insufficient to fully satisfy
all such Losses, Purchaser shall have the right to exercise the set-off
provisions, if and to the extent set-off is available, for the amount of such
shortfall, first, under the Company Shareholder Note delivered to the Escrow
Agent on behalf of such Principal Shareholder at the Closing pursuant to
Section 2.3(a)(iv), and second, under the Company Shareholder Note received
by such Principal Shareholder at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(v).

9.9 _Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Person receives written notice of
a third-party claim, including from a Tax Authority, that such Indemnified
Person believes may result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this Article 9, Purchaser (in the case such Indemnified Person is a Purchaser
Indemnified Person) or the Class A Holder (in the case such Indemnified Person
is a Company Indemnified Person) shall promptly notify the other (or in the
case of a third-party claim that may result in an Individual Claim, the
applicable Company Shareholders(s)) of such third-party claim, and provide the
Indemnifying Person the opportunity to direct, through counsel of its own
choosing (who shall be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser or the Class A
Holder (or Company Shareholder(s)), as the case may be), at its own cost (to
be shared proportionally by all Principal Shareholders in the case of the
Class A Holder), the defense and, subject to the next sentence, settlement of
such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the claim or proceeding solely
seeks (and continues to seek) monetary damages or an amount in respect of
Taxes; and (b) the Indemnified Person reasonably determines in good faith
that there is no reasonable likelihood that such claim will cause any
Indemnified Person to suffer Losses (other than Losses not subject to
indemnification because of the application of the Purchaser
Indemnification Deductible or the Company Indemnification Deductible or
because of the application of provisions in Sections 9.3(c)(iv) and (v) in
which Purchaser specifically agrees to be liable for a specified portion of
Losses) in excess of the amount for which such Indemnified Person is entitled
to be indemnified under this Article 9 from time to time during the pendency
of the claim, excluding any amounts of the Escrow Fund as are the subject of
any then pending Liability Claims (if applicable) (the conditions set forth
in clauses (a) and (b) are, collectively, the " _Litigation Conditions_ ").
Any settlement of such claim by the Indemnifying Person shall require the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Person (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the Litigation Conditions are met and
the Indemnifying Person elects to assume the defense of any such claim or
proceeding, the Indemnifying Person shall allow the Indemnified Persons to
participate in such defense, but in such case the expenses of the Indemnified
Persons shall be paid by the Indemnified Persons. An Indemnified Person shall
provide the Indemnifying Person and its counsel with reasonable access to its
records and 



 

88  personnel relating to any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding during
normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with the Indemnifying
Person in the defense or settlement thereof, and the Indemnified Persons
shall be reimbursed for all of their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in
connection therewith. If the Indemnifying Person fails to defend or if, after
commencing or undertaking any such defense, the Indemnifying Person fails to
prosecute or withdraws from such defense, or if any of the Litigation
Conditions cease to be met, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to
undertake the defense or settlement thereof, and in its sole discretion to
settle any such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the consent of
the Indemnifying Person, no settlement of any such claim with third-party
claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such
matter. If the Indemnifying Person consents to any such settlement, no Person
shall have any power or authority to object to the amount or validity of any
claim by or on behalf of the Indemnified Person for indemnity with respect to
such settlement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in
connection with any third-party claim, any costs and expenses of defense and
investigation, including court costs and reasonable attorneys fees incurred or
suffered by the Indemnified Persons in connection with the defense of any
such third party claim, other than costs of the Indemnified Persons counsel
to be borne by the Indemnified Person pursuant to the third sentence of this
Section 9.9, whether or not it is determined that there was a breach or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty or any other matter specified in
Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 as a basis for indemnification under this
Agreement, shall constitute Losses subject to indemnities under Section 9.1
or Section 9.2. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, for purposes of Section 9.9, and subject to the limitations set
forth in this Section 9.9, with respect to the matters set forth on
_Schedule P_ and _Schedule Q_, the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall be
treated as the Indemnified Party and the Principal Shareholders shall be
treated as the Indemnifying Persons.

9.10 _Acknowledgement of Certain Rights of the Class A Holder_. Each Company
Shareholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that, in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, the Class A Holder is permitted or required to take certain
actions, including without limitation, making certain decisions or giving or
withholding its approval or consent, and that in taking (or failing to take)
all such actions permitted under this Agreement, the Class A Holder is not
acting as an agent, representative, fiduciary or otherwise on behalf of any
other Company Shareholder and the Class A Holder shall be entitled to act in
its sole discretion. Moreover, each Company Shareholder acknowledges and
agrees that the Class A Holder shall have no obligation to consider the
interests of the other Company Shareholders in exercising any of its rights
pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE 10

GENERAL PROVISIONS

10.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties made by the Company, the Company Shareholders
and Purchaser in this Agreement or any Related Agreement shall survive the
Closing and remain in full force and effect until the second anniversary of
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Sections 4.2,
4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 4.10 shall survive the Closing and remain in full
force and effect indefinitely; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.9 shall not survive
the 



 

89  Closing. Any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement to be
performed prior to the Closing (other than any Payment Covenants) shall
survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date. Each of the Payment Covenants and any
covenant or agreement contained in Section 6.4, the second sentence of Section
6.8 and Sections 6.12, 6.13, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16 and 6.18 shall survive the

breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement has been given
on or before the Date of Survival by a party in whose favor such

relevant representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive, as to
such claim, until the claim has been finally resolved. Except as set forth in

Survival.

10.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
section or article, such reference shall be to a section or article of this
Agreement, unless otherwise clearly indicated to the contrary. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement, and annex, article, section,
paragraph, exhibit and schedule references are references to the annex,
articles, sections, paragraphs, exhibits and schedules of this Agreement,
unless otherwise specified. The words "made available" shall, unless otherwise
specifically provided herein, mean, with respect to any statement in this
Agreement to the effect that any information, document or other material has
been "made available" to Purchaser, that such 



 

91  information, document or material: (a) was available for review by Purchaser
or its accountants or counsel in the virtual data room provided by the Company
in connection with this Agreement for at least the period from 5:00 p.m.
Eastern time on the date one (1) Business Day prior the date hereof through
the date hereof, (b) can be shown by the Company to have been available for
review on January 8, 2010 or January 13, 2010, in either case, by Purchaser
or its accountants or counsel in the offices of the Company or Norton Rose
Group located in Greece, or (c) delivered to Purchaser or its accountants or
counsel by electronic mail prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the date one
(1) Business Day prior to the date hereof. The plural of any defined term
shall have a meaning correlative to such defined term and words denoting any
gender shall include all genders and the neuter. Where a word or phrase is
defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have a corresponding
meaning. All references in this Agreement and in any Related Agreement to
amounts of money expressed in dollars are references to United States
dollars, unless otherwise indicated. For purposes of calculating the amount
of the Adjusted Purchase Price, except as provided otherwise herein, any
amounts denominated in any currency other than United States dollars shall be
converted to United States dollars using the applicable Exchange Rate as of
the date of the Closing Date. Any reference to a party to this Agreement or
any other agreement or document contemplated hereby shall include such partys
successors and permitted assigns. A reference to any legislation or to any
provision of any legislation shall include any modification, amendment, re-
enactment thereof, any legislative provision substituted therefore and all
rules, regulations and statutory instruments issued or related to such
legislation. The headings and captions in this Agreement are for reference
only and shall not be used in the construction or interpretation of this
Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. No prior draft of this Agreement nor any course of performance or
course of dealing shall be used in the interpretation or construction of this
Agreement. No parole evidence shall be introduced in the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement unless the ambiguity or uncertainty in issue
is plainly discernable from a reading of this Agreement without consideration
of any extrinsic evidence. Although the same or similar subject matters may
be addressed in different provisions of this Agreement, the parties intend
that, except as reasonably apparent on the face of the Agreement or as
expressly provided in this Agreement, each such provision shall be read
separately, be given independent significance and not be construed as
limiting any other provision of this Agreement (whether or not more general or
more specific in scope, substance or content). The doctrine of election of
remedies shall not apply in constructing or interpreting the remedies
provisions of this Agreement or the equitable power of a court considering
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being
understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. The
exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise)
by facsimile or by electronic delivery in PDF or other picture format shall
be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.



 

92 10.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to
herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached
hereto (but not including any Related Agreements), the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the Company Shareholder Disclosure Schedules, (a) constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, except the Prior
NDA, which shall continue in full force and effect following any termination
of this Agreement and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in
accordance with its terms, but shall terminate automatically at the Closing,
and (b) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as conferring,
upon any Person (other than the parties hereto and, with respect to Article 9,
the Persons with indemnification rights thereunder and the directors and
officers of the Company to the extent provided in Section 6.14) any rights or
remedies hereunder. The Prior NDA shall terminate and be of no further force
or effect upon the Closing.

10.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written content of the other
parties, except that Purchaser may, without prior written consent of the other
parties, assign this Agreement and any of its respective rights, interest or
obligations hereunder to an Affiliate of Purchaser or in connection with a
merger of Purchaser or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
Purchaser, but no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder (including, to pay the Purchase Price and issue the Company
Shareholder Notes in accordance with Article 2). Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

10.7 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the parties that, to the
extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot
be given to both or all such provisions, (i) the representations, warranties,
covenants and closing conditions in this Agreement shall be construed to be
cumulative; (ii) each representation, warranty, covenant and closing
condition in this Agreement shall be given full separate and independent
effect; and (iii) no limitation in any representation, warranty, covenant or
closing condition shall be construed to limit any other representation,
warranty, covenant or closing condition unless such limitation is expressly
made applicable to such other representation, warranty, covenant or closing
condition.

10.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be invalid, void or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the invalid, void or unenforceable term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final
judgment of such court or arbitrator declares that any term or provision
hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree to reduce the
scope, duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the original intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision.



 

93 10.9 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or
delay on the part of either party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and
remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive
of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. For the avoidance of doubt,
the parties agree that no corporate ratification or rectification of prior
board or shareholder actions or omissions, no approval of statutory accounts
or other similar corporate action occurring post-Closing, nor any filing with
a Governmental Entity of any such document by Purchaser, the Company or any
Subsidiary with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary shall be deemed a
waiver of, consent to or acquiescence on the part of Purchaser in any breach
of any representation, warranty or obligation by the Company, any Subsidiary
or any Company Shareholders under this Agreement.

10.10 _Agent for Service of Process_. Each of the Company and each of the
non-U.S. Company Shareholders has appointed CT Corporation, with offices on
the date hereof at 111 Eighth Avenue, 13th Floor, New York, New York 10011, as
its authorized agent in the State of New York (the " _Authorized Agent_ "),
upon whom process may be served in any suit, action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to each of the non-U.S. Company
Shareholders who is a Non-Principal Shareholder, such appointment shall
terminate on the third anniversary of the Closing Date. The Authorized Agent
has accepted such appointment and has agreed to act as said agent for service
of process, and each of the Company and each of the non-U.S. Company
Shareholders agrees to take any and all action, including the filing of any
and all documents that may be necessary to continue such
respective appointment in full force and effect. Service of process upon the
Authorized Agent shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of
process upon the Company and each non-U.S. Company Shareholder, as applicable.
Each of the Company and each of the non-U.S. Company Shareholders also agrees
that process may be served upon it in any suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
by registered mail to its address set forth (i) with respect to the Company,
in Section 10.2, and (ii) with respect to any non-U.S. Company Shareholder, on
the signature pages attached to this Agreement. Each of the Company and each
non-U.S. Company Shareholder shall each take all steps to maintain, and in
the case of non-U.S. Company Shareholders who are Non-Principal Shareholders,
at all times on or before the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Authorized Agent as such partys authorized agent in the State of New York
upon whom process may be served with respect to such party, and shall take any
further efforts necessary or reasonably requested by Purchaser in furtherance
thereof.

10.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without regard to any
such Laws, the application of which would result in the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

10.12 _Dispute Resolution and Venue_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
in Sections 2.5, Section 6.7 and Article 9, any dispute, claim or controversy
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination,
enforcement, interpretation or validity hereof, including any request for
specific performance, claim based on contract, tort, statute or 



 

94  constitution or the determination of the scope or applicability of this
agreement to arbitrate, will be determined by arbitration in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York before one arbitrator. The arbitration will be
administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services pursuant to its
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, as modified in this Section
10.12.

(a) The arbitrator will not have the power to order hearings and meetings to
be held in any place or places outside of the Borough of Manhattan, New York,
New York. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English.

(b) The arbitrator will have the power to order any remedy, including
monetary damages, specific performance and all other forms of legal and
equitable relief, except that the arbitrator will not have the power to order
special, exemplary or punitive damages. The arbitrator may hear and rule on
dispositive motions as part of the arbitration proceeding (e.g., motions for
summary disposition).

(c) Each party will be entitled to the timely production by the other party
of relevant, non-privileged documents or copies thereof. If the parties are
unable to agree on the scope and/or timing of such document production, the
arbitrator will have the power, upon application of any party, to make all
appropriate orders for the production of documents by any party.

(d) Before the arbitrator establishes the facts of the case, each party will
be entitled to examine witnesses by deposition to provide non-privileged
testimony that is relevant to the controversies, claims or disputes at issue.
If the parties are unable to agree on the propriety, scope or timing of a
deposition, the arbitrator, upon the application of any party, may make all
appropriate orders in connection with a proposed deposition.

(e) The arbitrator may appoint expert witnesses only with the consent of all
of the parties to the arbitration.

(f) The arbitrators fees and the administrative expenses of the arbitration
will be paid equally by the parties. Each party to the arbitration will pay
its own costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with the
arbitration.

(g) The award rendered by the arbitrator will be executory, final and binding
on the parties. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered into any
court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for
judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may
be. Such court proceeding will disclose only the minimum amount of information
concerning the arbitration as is required to obtain such acceptance or order.

(h) Except as required by law, no party may disclose the existence, contents
or results of an arbitration brought in accordance with this Agreement, or
the evidence produced by its opposing parties, or any analyses or summaries
derived from such evidence.



 

95 (i) Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees that in connection with any
such action process may be served in the same manner as notices may be
delivered under Section 10.2 and irrevocably waives any defenses it may have
to service in such manner.

(j) Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees that this Agreement does not
preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from
(i) the trial courts of superior jurisdiction located in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York or (ii) the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. For the purposes of this subparagraph, each of
the parties hereto consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of
the courts described in the first sentence of this subparagraph, agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other application, agrees that it will not bring any Action relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any other court, agrees that it will not assert as a defense that such Action
may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue
thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement may not be enforced in
or by such courts, and agrees that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such Actions in the manner provided in Section 10.2 or in
such other manner as may be permitted by Law will be valid and sufficient
service thereof.

(k) Each party to this Agreement waives any right it may have to assert the
doctrine of forum non conveniens or similar doctrine or to object to venue
with respect to any proceeding brought in accordance with this Section 10.12,
stipulates that the courts located in New York, New York shall have
in personam jurisdiction and venue over each of them for the purpose of
litigating any dispute, controversy, or proceeding arising out of or related
to this Agreement, and hereby authorizes and accepts service of process
sufficient for personal jurisdiction in any action against it. Any final
judgment rendered against a party in any action or proceeding shall be
conclusive as to the subject of such final judgment and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions in any manner provided by law. 

10.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF THE COMPANY, PURCHASER OR ANY COMPANY
SHAREHOLDER IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.

10.14 _Postponement of Closing and Suspension of Conditions_.

(a) At any time when the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3
(excluding conditions that, by their terms, are not expected to be satisfied
until the Closing Date) have been satisfied or waived, then subject to the
notice requirements in Section 2.4, Purchaser may elect to postpone the
Closing to a date to be specified by Purchaser to occur not later than March
26, 2010.



 

96 (b) If a Closing Delay Event shall have occurred, then from and after 5:00 pm
Eastern time on the Closing Delay Event Date, the obligations of Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall no longer be subject to
the satisfaction at or prior to the Closing of the conditions set forth in (i)
Section 7.1, (ii) the first sentence of Section 7.3(a) (except with respect
to the Excepted Company Representations), or (ii) Sections 7.3(b) or (c).

10.15 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Company
Shareholder Notes were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Company Shareholder
Notes or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof before any arbitrator specified in Section 10.12 in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
