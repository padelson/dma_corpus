 (vi) Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the reasonable review and approval of Parent, the Company shall have taken all actions necessary to effect the transactions anticipated by this Section 1.6(e) and Section 5.10(b) hereof under the Plan, all Company Option agreements, all Company RSU agreements and any other plan or arrangement of the Company (whether written or oral, formal or informal), including delivering all required notices and obtaining any required consents necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Agreement.

 (h) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of Common Stock of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands or offer
to settle or settle any such demands. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent that Parent or the Company (i) makes any payment or payments in respect
of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration that otherwise would
have been payable in respect of such shares in accordance with this
Agreement, or (ii) incurs any other costs or expenses, (including
specifically, but without limitation, attorneys fees, costs and expenses in
connection with any action or proceeding or in connection with any
investigation) in respect of any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for
such shares) (together "Dissenting Share Payments"), Parent shall be entitled
to recover under the terms of Section 7.2 hereof the amount of such Dissenting
Share Payments.

Upon Parent making each aggregate payment required of it under this Agreement to the Exchange and Paying Agent, Parent shall have fulfilled its obligations with respect to such payment. Neither Parent nor the Exchange and Paying Agent shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to the distribution of such payments among the Stockholders/former Stockholders of the Company.

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. On or after the Closing Date, Parent shall mail a letter of transmittal to each Stockholder at the address set forth opposite each such Stockholders name on Section 2.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

No interest shall be payable on any cash deliverable upon the exchange of any Company Capital Stock. 

   

 (e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Company Stock Certificate surrendered 

    ##### 

  

 

in exchange therefor is registered, or if any cash amounts are to be
disbursed pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof to person other than the person or
entity whose name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery
thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares
of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder
of the certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent
or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable. 

   

 (f) _Exchange and Paying Agent to Return Consideration_. At any time following the last day of the respective six (6) month period following the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange and Paying Agent to deliver to Parent or its designated successor or assign all shares of Parent Common Stock and cash that have been deposited with the Exchange and Paying Agent pursuant to Section 1.9(b) hereof, and any income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.9(c) hereof, and thereafter the holders of Company Stock Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to the terms of Section 1.9(g) hereof) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any and all amounts that may be payable to such holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof upon the due surrender of such Company Stock Certificates in the manner set forth in Section 1.9(c) hereof. 

   

 (g) _No Liability_.

 1.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The cash amounts paid and Parent Common Stock issued in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE I. 

  

 1.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange and Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Stockholder who is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to either (i) deliver a bond in such amount as it may reasonably direct or (ii) provide an indemnification agreement in form and

substance acceptable to Parent, against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Exchange and Paying Agent with respect to the certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  #####

Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or such Affiliate, as the case may be.

The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or the Parent contained in Section 3.1, Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.4 and Section 3.12 hereof (the "Parent Indemnity Representations"), or in any certificate or other instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the expiration of such twelve (12) month period, the "Survival Date", _provided, however_ , that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 2.2 and Section 2.11 hereof shall survive indefinitely and until 30 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, respectively), and provided further, however, that if, at any time prior to the close of business on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, a Parent Officers Certificate (as defined in Section 7.5(b) hereof) or a Stockholder Representatives Certificate (as defined in Section 7.5(c) hereof) is delivered alleging Losses (as defined in Section 7.2 hereof) and a claim for recovery under Section 7.5 hereof, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date until such claim is fully and finally resolved. The representations and warranties of Parent and Sub contained in this Agreement, other than the Parent Indemnity Representations, or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate at the Closing. 

  

 7.2 _Stockholder Obligations for Indemnification_. The Stockholders agree to indemnify and hold Parent and its officers, directors, and affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation (the "Parent Indemnified Parties"), harmless against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of investigation and defense and diminution in value (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and collectively "Losses") incurred or sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Surviving Corporation), directly or indirectly, as a result of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instruments delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any failure by the Company or the Stockholders to perform or comply with any covenant applicable to it contained in this Agreement, (iii) the amount of any Excess Third Party Expenses, and/or (iv) the amount of any Dissenting Share Payments.

For all purposes of this Section 7.2, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue proceeds available under the insurance policies it maintains and any Loss of any Parent Indemnified Party shall be net of (A) any insurance or other recoveries actually received by the Parent Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (after accounting for reasonable costs incurred to collect such insurance recoveries) and (B) any actual 

   #####

 7.4  _Escrow Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) _Escrow Fund_. 

   

 (i) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount. The shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Escrow Amount shall be represented by a single stock certificate registered in the name of Var and Co., as nominee of the Escrow Agent. Such deposit of the Escrow Amount shall be contained in an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth herein. The Escrow Fund shall be security for the indemnity obligations provided for in Section 7.2 hereof. The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate the Parent Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are entitled to recovery under this ARTICLE VII. The Escrow Agent may execute this Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and such later execution, if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the binding nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof between the other signatories hereto. Interests in the Escrow Fund shall be non-transferable. 

  

 (ii) Subject to Section 7.4(a)(iii) hereof, if on the Survival Date, the value of the Escrow Shares (valued at the Signing Price) is greater than or equal to the Survival Escrow Value, then Parent shall deliver the Contingent Cash Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent, together with a written notice identifying the Contingent Cash Escrow Amount, which shall constitute part of the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (iii) If a pending claim exists on the Survival Date, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (valuing each such share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Signing Price), of aggregate value equal to the amount of such pending claim shall be retained by the Escrow 

   ##### 

  

    

Agent in the Escrow Fund. Once a final determination is made as to whether
Parent is entitled to recover Losses in connection with such pending claim,
the amount of such claim (if any) to which Parent is entitled shall be paid
in Parent Common Stock (valuing each share of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Signing Price) and the remainder (if any) shall be allocated to the
Stockholders in accordance with their pro rata portions of the Escrow Fund. 

  

 (b) _Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Periods_. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., local time at Parents headquarters, on the Survival Date (the "Escrow Period"); _provided, however_ , that the Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to any amount which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent, is or may be necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representative prior to the Escrow Period termination date with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to the Survival Date. As soon as all such claims have been resolved in accordance with Section 7.5 hereof, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy such claims to the Stockholders. Deliveries of amounts out of the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders pursuant to this Section 7.4(b) shall be made in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portions of the remaining shares in the Escrow Fund, with the number of shares delivered to each Stockholder rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, with such other adjustments as may be necessary (and agreed to between Parent the Stockholder Representative) such that the whole number of shares issued from the Escrow Fund equals the whole number of shares in the Escrow Fund. Any distribution of all or a portion of the Parent Common Stock to the Stockholders shall be made by delivery of the stock certificate held by the Escrow Agent representing the Parent Common Stock to the Parent, endorsed for transfer, with instruction to the Parent to transfer and issue, or cause its transfer agent to transfer and issue, the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock being distributed, allocated among the Stockholders based upon his or her Pro Rata Portion, in each case by issuing to each such Stockholder a stock certificate, without restrictive legend thereon, representing such allocated shares, registered in his or her name set forth on the schedule delivered to the Escrow Agent at Closing and mailed by first class mail to such Stockholders address set forth on such schedule (or to such other address as such Stockholder may have previously instructed the Escrow Agent in writing); and, if less than all the then remaining shares of Parent Common Stock are to be so distributed and transferred, the Escrow Agent shall instruct the Parent to issue and return to the Escrow Agent (or its nominee, if the Escrow Agent shall so instruct) a stock certificate representing the remaining shares of Parent Common Stock. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for the actions or omissions of, or any delay on the part of, the Parent in connection with the foregoing. 

   

 (c) _Protection of Escrow Fund_. 

   

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms of this Section 7.4(c).

##### 

 

   

 (ii) Any opinion of counsel required to be delivered pursuant to any restrictive legend appearing on the certificate evidencing the Parent Common Stock in connection with any distribution of Parent Common Stock to be made by the Escrow Agent under or pursuant to this Agreement shall include the Escrow Agent as an addressee or shall expressly consent to the Escrow Agents reliance thereon, _provided, however_ , that if Parent shall so request such an opinion of counsel, Parent shall bear the cost of providing such opinion of counsel. 

  

 (iii) The parties hereto agree to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax identification number by signing and returning a Form W-9 to the Escrow Agent, upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

  

 (iv) Neither the Escrow Agent nor its nominee shall be under any duty to take any action to preserve, protect, exercise or enforce any rights or remedies under or with respect to the Parent Common Stock (including without limitation with respect to the exercise of any voting or consent rights, conversion or exchange rights, defense of title, preservation of rights against prior matters or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Escrow Agent is so requested in a written request of the Stockholders Representative received by the Escrow Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date on which the Escrow Agent is requested therein to take such action (or such later date as may be acceptable to the Escrow Agent), the Escrow Agent shall execute or cause its nominee to execute, and deliver to the Stockholders Representative a proxy or other instrument in the form supplied to it by the Stockholders Representative for voting or otherwise exercising any right of consent with respect to any of the Parent Common Stock held by it hereunder, to authorize therein the Stockholders Representative to exercise such voting or consent authority in respect of the Escrow Fund (provided that the Escrow Agent shall not be obliged to execute any such proxy or other instrument if, in its judgment, the terms thereof may subject the Escrow Agent to any liabilities or obligations in its individual capacity). The Escrow Agent shall not be under any duty or responsibility to forward to any of the parties hereto, or to notify any such parties with respect to, or to take any action with respect to, any notice, solicitation or other document or information, written or otherwise, received from an issuer or other person with respect to the Escrow Shares, including but not limited to, proxy material, tenders, options, the pendency of calls and maturities and expiration of rights. 

  

 (v) Cash dividends, and any non-cash taxable dividends or distributions, on any shares of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the Stockholders according to their Pro Rata Portion, and shall not become a part of the Escrow Fund. Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity securities issued or distributed by Parent after the Effective Time in a nontaxable transaction ("New Shares") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund which have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof. The parties hereto (other than the Escrow Agent) agree that the Stockholders are the owners of any stock in the Escrow Fund. New Shares issued in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock which have been released from the Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the record holders thereof.

 7.5 _Indemnification Claims_. 

  

 (a) _Basket; Deductible_. 

   

 (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except as set forth in the second sentence of this Section 7.5(a)(i), a Parent Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under Section 7.2(i) hereof unless and until one or more Parent Officers Certificates (as defined below) identifying such Losses under Section 7.2(i) hereof in excess of $4,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Basket") has or have been delivered to the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 7.5(b) hereof, in which case the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover, subject to the other limitations set forth in this Agreement, all Losses incurred in excess of $2,000,000 (the "Deductible")(including the $2,000,000 difference between the Deductible and the Basket). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover for, and neither the Basket nor the Deductible shall apply as a threshold to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to (A) all Losses incurred pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of Section 7.2 hereof, and (B) Losses resulting from any breach of representation or warranty contained in Section 2.2 and (Company Capital Structure) and in Section 2.11 (Tax Matters) hereof. 

  

 (ii) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a Stockholder Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under Section 7.3(i) hereof unless and until one or more Stockholder Representatives Certificates (as defined below) identifying such Losses under Section 7.3(i) hereof in excess of the Basket has or have been delivered to Parent as provided in Section 7.5(c) hereof, in which case the Stockholder Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover, subject to the other limitations set forth in this Agreement, all Losses incurred in excess of the Deductible (including the $2,000,000 difference between the Deductible and the Basket). 

  

 (b) _Parent Indemnified Parties  Claims for Indemnification_. In order to seek indemnification under Section 7.2, Parent shall deliver a Parent Officers Certificate to the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent to be received by them at any time on or before the last day of the Escrow Period; _provided, however_ , Parent may seek indemnification for a breach of a representation and warranty of the Company contained in Section 2.2 and Section 2.11 hereof following the expiration of the Escrow Period by delivering a Parent Officers Certificate to the Stockholder Representative on or before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Unless the Stockholder Representative shall have delivered a Stockholder Objection Notice pursuant to Section 7.5(d) hereof, the Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Parent Officers Certificate, deliver to the Parent Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the Loss set forth in such Parent Officers Certificate. Any payment from the Escrow Fund to Parent Indemnified Parties shall be made in whole shares of Parent Common Stock (valuing each share of Parent Common Stock equal to the Signing Price) to the extent there remain any Escrow Shares in the Escrow Fund. For the purposes hereof, "Parent Officers Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by any officer of Parent: (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it 

   ##### 

  

   

will have to pay, sustain, incur, or accrue Losses, (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so
stated, the date each such item was paid, sustained, incurred, or properly
accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related, and (iii) specifying the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock represented by such incurred and/or anticipated Losses. 

   

 (c) _Stockholder Indemnified Parties  Claims for Indemnification_. In order to seek indemnification under Section 7.3, the Stockholder Representative shall deliver a Stockholder Representative Certificate to Parent at any time on or before the last day of the Escrow Period. Unless Parent shall have delivered a Parent Objection Notice pursuant to Section 7.5(e) hereof, Parent shall promptly, and in no event later than the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Stockholder Representative Certificate, deliver in accordance with the written instructions of the Stockholder Representative, which instructions shall be conclusively binding upon the Stockholder Indemnified Part(y)(ies) and may be relied upon by Parent, for distribution to the Stockholder Indemnified Part(y)(ies) an amount equal to the Loss set forth in such Stockholder Representatives Certificate. Any such payment shall be made either by wire transfer or check, as the Stockholder Representative may direct in its written instructions to Parent. For the purposes hereof, "Stockholder Representatives Certificate" shall mean a certificate signed by the Stockholder Representative: (1) stating that a Stockholder Indemnified Party has paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay, sustain, incur, or accrue Losses, and (2) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, sustained, incurred, or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related. 

   

 (d) _Objections to Parent Indemnified Parties  Claims for Indemnification_. No such payment shall be made under Section 7.5(a) hereof if the Stockholder Representative shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Parent Officers Certificate (a "Stockholder Objection Notice"), and such Stockholder Objection Notice shall have been received by Parent and the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Parent Officers Certificate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders hereby waive the right to object to any claims in respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss (as defined in Section 7.5(f)(v) hereof). If the Stockholder Representative does not to object in writing within such 30-day period, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Parent Officers Certificate, and payment in respect of such Losses shall thereafter be made in accordance with this Section 7.5. 

   

 (e) _Objections to Stockholder Indemnified Parties  Claims for Indemnification_. No such payment shall be made under Section 7.5(c) if Parent shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Stockholder Representatives Certificate (a "Parent Objection Notice"), and such Parent Objection Notice shall have been delivered to the Stockholder Representative prior to the expiration of the thirtieth (30th) day after its receipt of the Stockholder Representatives 

   ##### 

  

   

Certificate. If Parent does not to object in writing within such 30-day
period, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by
Parent that the Stockholder Indemnified Part(y)(ies) is/are entitled to the
full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Stockholder
Representatives Certificate, and payment in respect of such Losses shall
thereafter be made in accordance with this Section 7.5. 

   

 (f) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_. 

   

 (i) In case the Stockholder Representative delivers a Stockholder Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.5(d) hereof (other than Agreed-Upon Losses as defined in Section 7.5(f)(v) hereof) or Parent delivers a Parent Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.5(e) hereof, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a Parent Objection Notice, furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. 

  

 (ii) If, after thirty (30) days after delivery of a Stockholder Objection Notice or a Parent Objection Notice, as the case may be, no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent, on the one hand, or the Stockholder Representative on the other hand, may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative. In the event that, within thirty (30) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Stockholder Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) days after the end of such thirty (30) day period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. If the Stockholder Representative fails to select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15) day period, then the parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator selected by Parent. 

  

 (iii) Any such arbitration shall be held in Boston, Massachusetts, under the rules then in effect of JAMS/Endispute ("JAMS"). All expenses relating to the arbitration (but excluding each parties own expenses) shall be paid, including without limitation, the fees of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of JAMS shall be paid as follows: fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Stockholders on the basis of the Stockholders respective Pro Rata Portions;  _provided, however_ , that each party shall bear its own respective expenses relating to the arbitration, including without limitation, legal and expert witness fees. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a 

   ##### 

  

 

majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon
motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose
sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a
competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the
three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was
sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or
objected to without substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator
or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the
validity and amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be
final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Such
decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact
and conclusions, which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order
awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
on and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms
of such award, judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within ten (10) days
of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another,
such party shall make the payment to such other party. The prevailing party
shall be awarded its costs and attorneys fees in connection with
the arbitration pursuant to this Section 7.5(f). 

   

 (iv) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The forgoing arbitration provision shall apply to any dispute under this ARTICLE VII, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.7 hereof. 

  

 (v) This Section 7.5(f) shall not apply to claims made in respect of (1) any Dissenting Share Payments (as defined in Section 1.7(c) hereof), (2) any Excess Third Party Expenses (as defined in Section 5.4 hereof), or (3) any Agent Interpleader Expenses or Agent Indemnification Expenses pursuant to clauses (vi) and (vii) of Section 7.5(h) hereof (each, an "Agreed-Upon Loss"). Claims against the Escrow Fund made in respect of any Agreed-Upon Loss shall be resolved in the manner described in Section 7.5(d) above. 

  

 (g) _Third-Party Claims_. 

   

 (i) In the event Parent or the Stockholder Representative becomes aware of a third party claim (other than a claim that is the subject of an Agreed-Upon Loss) (a "Third Party Claim") which the party becoming aware of such Third Party Claim reasonably believes may result in a demand for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE VII, such party shall notify the other party of such claim, and in the case of a Third Party Claim of which Parent becomes aware, Parent shall also notify the Escrow Agent. If the Third Party Claim may result in a claim against the Escrow Fund, the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Stockholders, shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such Third Party Claim. Parent shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such claim; _provided, however_ , that except with the consent of the Stockholder Representative, no settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter. In the event that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the Stockholders shall have no power or authority to object to the amount of any Third Party Claim by Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 7.5(g) shall not apply to any third party claim that is the subject of an Agreed-Upon Loss.

 (h) _Escrow Agent s Duties_. 

   

 (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement that are signed by an officer of Parent and the Stockholder Representative and are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, or, in the reasonable opinion of Escrow Agent, will not result in additional obligations or liabilities to the Escrow Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agents duties hereunder are ministerial in nature and shall not be deemed fiduciary. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. 

  

 (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction. 

  

 (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder. 

  

 (iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent. 

  

 (v) In performing any duties under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses (including losses resulting from liquidating a position in the Money Market Account), or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (1) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good faith, or (2) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with performing the Escrow Agents duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents and the Escrow Fund and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agents discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and the Escrow Fund held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action (the "Agent Interpleader Expenses") and which the parties agree to pay as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis of the Stockholders respective Pro Rata Portions;  _provided, however_ , that in the event any Stockholder fails to timely pay his or her Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its option pay such Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses and recover an equal amount (which shall be deemed a Loss) from such Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of his/her duties under this Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject matter, other than those arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the "Agent Indemnification Expenses") as follows: fifty percent (50%) to be paid by Parent and fifty percent (50%) to be paid by the Stockholders on the basis of the Stockholders Pro Rata Portions directly from the Escrow Fund; _provided, however_ , that in the event the Stockholders portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses cannot be satisfied from the Escrow Fund in full, the parties agree that Parent shall pay the shortfall of such Stockholders portion of the Agent Indemnification Expenses, and shall be entitled to recover such amount from each Stockholder equal to such Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of such amount without regard to any caps or other limits herein. 

  

 (viii) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days written notice to the Parent and the Stockholder Representative; _provided, however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows: Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of New York or appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent and 

   ##### 

  

    

shall remain the escrow agent until such order is received. The successor
escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such
appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the
estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow
agent as if originally named as escrow agent. Upon appointment of a successor
escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any further duties
and liability under this Agreement. 

  

 (ix) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any investment permitted by this Agreement, or in carrying out any sale of the Escrow Fund permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or such affiliate is acting as a subagent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person or dealing as principal for its own account. 

  

 (x) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any provision seeking to limit the liability of the Escrow Agent shall not be applicable in the event such liability arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. 

  

 (xi) Notwithstanding any term appearing in this Agreement to the contrary, in no instance shall the Escrow Agent be required or obligated to distribute any of the Escrow Fund (or take other action that may be called for hereunder to be taken by the Escrow Agent) sooner than two (2) Business Days after (i) it has received the applicable documents required under this Agreement in good form, or (ii) passage of the applicable time period (or both, as applicable under the terms of this Agreement), as the case may be. 

  

 (xii) The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts beyond its control. Such acts shall include but not be limited to acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, terrorism, epidemics, governmental regulations superimposed after the fact, fire, communication line failures, computer viruses, power failures, earthquakes or other disasters. 

  

 (i) _Fees_. All fees (including attorneys fees) of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent previously delivered to Parent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement but that has been requested by an officer of Parent, or if the parties request a substantial modification of the terms of the Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees, including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or litigation. 

   

 (j) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation or other entity into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or other entity resulting from any merger, conversion or 

   ##### 

  

   

consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a
party, or any corporation or other entity to which substantially all the
corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may
be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement without
further act. 

   

 7.6 _Stockholder Representative_. 

  

 (a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the requisite vote of the Stockholders, each of the Stockholders shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint Paul Egerman as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the Stockholders to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party against any Stockholder or by any such Stockholder against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Stockholder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive any compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Stockholders. 

   

 (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Stockholders shall indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Stockholder Representative ("Stockholder Representative Expenses"). A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative, including but not limited to an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement, shall constitute a decision of the Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Stockholders; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, 

   ##### 

  

   

act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders. The Escrow Agent and Parent
are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

REGISTRATION  

  

 8.1 _Filing and Effectiveness of Stockholder Registration Statement_. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement on Form S-3 (or other appropriate form if Form S-3 is not available) or prospective supplement to an existing registration statement of Parent covering the resale to the public by the Stockholders of all shares representing the Stockholder Equity Consideration other than the Escrow Shares (the "Stockholder Registration Statement") with the SEC within ten (10) business days following the later of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the delivery to Parent of the Required Financial Information and any auditor consents of the Company or the Surviving Corporation necessary to file the Registration Statement. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Stockholder Registration Statement to be automatically effective upon filing, or if automatic effectiveness is not available, to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable; provided, that Parent shall not be required to make any filing with the SEC prior to the date that such filing otherwise would be due. Parent shall cause the Stockholder Registration Statement to remain effective until the one year anniversary of the Closing Date or such earlier time as all of the Stockholder Equity Consideration covered by the Stockholder Registration Statement has been sold pursuant thereto.

   ##### 

  

    

 (b) If Parent delays or suspends the Stockholder Registration Statement or requires the Stockholders to cease sales of Stockholder Equity Consideration pursuant to Section 8.2(a) hereof, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following the termination of the circumstance which entitled Parent to do so, take such actions as may be necessary to file or reinstate the effectiveness of the Stockholder Registration Statement and/or give written notice to all Stockholders authorizing them to resume sales pursuant to the Stockholder Registration Statement. If as a result thereof the prospectus included in the Stockholder Registration Statement has been amended to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, Parent shall enclose such revised prospectus with the notice to Stockholders given pursuant to this Section 8.2(b), and the Stockholders shall make no offers or sales of Stockholder Equity Consideration pursuant to the Stockholder Registration Statement other than by means of such revised prospectus.

 10.2 _Interpretation_. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 10.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 10.4 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Exhibits hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein: (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, and (iii) shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to its affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder. 

  

 10.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

  

 10.6 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 10.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, regardless of the laws that might otherwise 

   #####

exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any court within Suffolk County,
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Business Litigation Session, in connection with
any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters
contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any
manner authorized by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for such
persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which
they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process. 

   

 10.8 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefor, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

  

 10.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
