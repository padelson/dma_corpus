SECTION 2.04 No Finder's Fee. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of the Shareholder.

  

  

SECTION 2.05 Purchase Entirely for Own Account. The Parent Shares proposed to
be acquired by the Shareholder hereunder will be acquired for investment for
its own account, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part
thereof, and the Shareholder has no present intention of selling or otherwise
distributing the Parent Shares, except in compliance with applicable
securities laws.

  

  

SECTION 2.06 Shareholder Status. The Shareholder has accurately confirmed on
Exhibit A attached hereto whether the Shareholder meets the definition of
"accredited investor" set forth in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Shareholder is not required to be
registered as a broker-dealer under Section 15 of the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

  

  

SECTION 2.07 Experience of Such Shareholder. The Shareholder, either alone or
together with its representatives, has such knowledge, sophistication and
experience in business and financial matters so as to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the Parent Shares and
has so evaluated the merits and risks of such investment. The Shareholder is
able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Parent Shares and, at
the present time, is able to afford a complete loss of such investment.

  

  

SECTION 2.08 Access to Information. The Shareholder acknowledges that it has
received and had the opportunity to review the Parent SEC Documents (as

3.15); and this Agreement and all exhibits hereto including the Parent
Disclosure Letter (as defined in the opening paragraph to Article IV) and the
Company Disclosure Letter (as defined in the opening paragraph in Article
III). Such Shareholder further acknowledges that it or its representatives
have been afforded (a) the opportunity to ask such questions as it has deemed
necessary of, and to receive answers from, representatives of the Parent and
the Company concerning the terms and conditions of the reorganization
contemplated by this Agreement and the offering of the Parent Shares, the
merits and risks of investing in the Parent Shares, (b) access to information
about the Parent and the Company and the Parent's and the Company's financial
condition, results of operations, business, properties, management and
prospects sufficient to enable it to evaluate the reorganization contemplated
by this Agreement and its investment in the Parent Shares, and (c) the
opportunity to obtain such additional information which the Parent or the
Company possesses or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that
is necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information
contained herein or otherwise provided to the Shareholder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 2.09 Restricted Securities. The Shareholder understands that the
Parent Shares are characterized as "restricted securities" under the
Securities Act inasmuch as the Parent Shares are being offered in a
transaction not involving a public offering. The Shareholder further
acknowledges that the Parent Shares may not be resold without registration
under the Securities Act or the existence of an exemption therefrom. The
Shareholder represents that it is familiar with Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act, as presently in effect, and understands the resale limitations
imposed thereby and by the Securities Act.

PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR
PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO,
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL TO
THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY
ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY.

necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such

expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company, a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or on the ability of the Company to consummate the Transactions (a
"Company Material Adverse Effect"). The Company is duly qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or its
ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary
except where the failure to so qualify would not reasonably be expected to

are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right
of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right or
any Contract to which the Company is a party or otherwise bound. There are no
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right
to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, capital shares having the

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no options,
warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock

extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, security,
commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking or (iii) that give any person

related to or limiting creditors' rights generally and by general principals
of equity.

  

  

SECTION 3.05 No Conflicts; Consents.

  

  

(a) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and
the consummation of the Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and
thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to
loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon
any of the properties or assets of the Company under, any provision of (i) the
Company Constituent Instruments, (ii) any material contract, lease, license,
indenture, note, bond, agreement, permit, concession, franchise or other

filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate, except
to the extent any failure to file or any inaccuracies in any filed Tax
Returns, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Returns, or otherwise owed, have been timely paid,
except to the extent that any failure to pay, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. There are no unpaid taxes in any material amount
claimed to be due by the taxing authority of any jurisdiction, and the
officers of the Company know of no basis for any such claim.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company Financial Statements reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes
payable by the Company (in addition to any reserve for deferred Taxes to

against the Company, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any
such Taxes are pending, except to the extent any such deficiency or request

benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company
(collectively, "Company Benefit Plans"). As of the date of this Agreement
there are no severance or termination agreements or arrangements between the
Company and any current or former employee, officer, director or manager of
the Company, nor does the Company have any general severance plan or policy.

  

  

SECTION 3.08 Litigation. There is no action, suit, inquiry, notice of
violation, proceeding (including any partial proceeding such as a deposition)
or investigation pending or threatened in writing against or affecting the
Company or any of its properties before or by any court, arbitrator,

material respect with any applicable Law.

SECTION 3.11 Contracts. Except as disclosed in the Contracts that are material
to the business, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise),
results of operations or prospects of the Company taken as a whole, the
Company is not in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any
condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice would cause
such a violation of or default under by the Company) any Contract to which it
is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except

and (ii) a review of the balance sheet of the Company as of September 30,
2013, and the related statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash
flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 (the

the ordinary course of business subsequent to September 30, 2013, and (ii)
obligations under Contracts and commitments incurred in the ordinary course of
business and not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be

has qualified for an extension for filing, all Tax Returns required to be
filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate, except

Returns, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Returns, or otherwise owed, have been timely paid,
except to the extent that any failure to pay, individually or in the

of or default under) any Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any

in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

interests in, all of its properties and assets used in the conduct of its
businesses. All such assets and properties, other than assets and properties
in which the Parent has leasehold interests, are free and clear of all Liens

in the Parent Disclosure Letter, none of the officers or directors of the
Parent and, to the knowledge of the Parent, none of the employees of the

by, providing for rental of real or personal property to or from, or otherwise
requiring payments to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to
the knowledge of the Parent, any entity in which any officer, director, or any
such employee has a substantial interest or is an officer, director, trustee
or partner.

  

  

SECTION 4.20 Internal Accounting Controls. The Parent maintains a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that
(i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or
specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. The Parent has established disclosure
controls and procedures for the Parent and designed such disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Parent is
made known to the officers by others within those entities. The Parent's
officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the Parent's controls and
procedures. Since September 30, 2007, there have been no significant changes
in the Parent's internal controls or, to the Parent's knowledge, in other
factors that could significantly affect the Parent's internal controls.

  

  

SECTION 4.21 Application of Takeover Protections. The Parent has taken all
necessary action, if any, in order to render inapplicable any control share
acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including any distribution
under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision under the
Parent Constituent Instruments or the laws of the State of Nevada that is or
could become applicable to the Shareholders as a result of the Shareholders
and the Parent fulfilling their obligations or exercising their rights under
this Agreement, including, without limitation, the issuance of the Parent

Parent Shares under this Agreement does not contravene the rules and

currently listed or quoted, and no approval of the stockholders of the Parent
is required for the Parent to issue and deliver to the Shareholders the Shares
contemplated by this Agreement.

Shares and which has not been publicly announced or disclosed in writing to
the Company.

SECTION 9.03 Termination.

consent at any time prior to the Closing;

after the notice of breach, or (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or before December 31, 2013, by reason of the failure of any condition
precedent under Section 6.02 hereof (unless the failure results primarily from
the Parent itself breaching any representation, warranty, or covenant
contained in this Agreement); and

  

  

(c) The Company may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Parent at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event the Parent has
breached any material representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this
Agreement in any material respect, the Company has notified the Parent of the
breach, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of twenty days
after the notice of breach or (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before December 31, 2013, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent

the Company or discovered by the Company in connection with its due diligence

Section 9.03(a) above, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder

SECTION 9.04 Replacement of Securities. If any certificate or instrument
evidencing any Parent Shares is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Parent shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and

satisfactory to the Parent of such loss, theft or destruction and customary
and reasonable indemnity, if requested. The applicants for a new certificate
or instrument under such circumstances shall also pay any reasonable third-
party costs associated with the issuance of such replacement Parent Shares. If
a replacement certificate or instrument evidencing any Parent Shares is
requested due to a mutilation thereof, the Parent may require delivery of such
mutilated certificate or instrument as a condition precedent to any issuance
of a replacement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 9.05 Remedies. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights
provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, the

under this Agreement. The Parties agree that monetary damages may not be

any action for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that a
remedy at law would be adequate.

  

  

SECTION 9.06 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a

policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that Transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

purposes.

other than the Parties any rights or remedies.

in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, regardless of the
laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
laws thereof. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees (i) that it is and shall continue to be subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California and of the federal
courts sitting in the State of California, and (ii)(A) to the extent that such
party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of

party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by
the U.S. Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service, and that, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, service made pursuant to
(ii)(A) or (B) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served
upon such party personally within the State of California.
