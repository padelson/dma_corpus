  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_. For purposes of allocating production (and accounts
receivable with respect thereto), under this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, (i)
liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Wells
when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities
into which they are transported from the lands covered by the applicable Well,
or if there are no storage facilities, when they pass through the LACT meter
or similar meter at the entry point into the pipelines through which they are
transported from such lands, and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to
be "from or attributable to" the Wells when they pass through the production
meters, flare meters, fuel use equipment, venting, or delivery point sales
meters or similar meters at the entry point into the pipelines through which
they are transported from such lands. Liquid Hydrocarbons in storage shall be
measured by gauging of tanks at the Effective Time. Seller shall utilize
reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of production
when exact meter readings (including gas production meters or sales meters)
or gauging data is not available.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt and subject to _Section_ __ _ 13.2_, the
Parties agree that, other than with respect to the Excluded Receivables, from

be responsible for, or otherwise required to pay, any Operating Expenses,
regardless when the same were incurred or paid and (ii) Seller shall expressly
be entitled to the Excluded Receivables, regardless when the same are received
by Buyer, Seller or their respective Affiliates. To the extent any Party or
its Affiliates receive any Excluded Receivables or proceeds that the other
Party is entitled to hereunder, then such Party (A) if in the form of cash,
such Party shall promptly remit such amounts to the other Party, or (B) if in
the form of a credit or a recoupment right (including in the form of a
recoupable balance), such Party shall promptly pay to the other Party an
amount in cash equal to the total dollar value of such non-cash Excluded
Receivables or receivable (including the amount of any such recoupable
balance).

 

 _2.4_ _Joint Interest and Other Audits_. After Closing, each Party shall
be entitled to participate in all joint interest audits and other audits of

Party with a copy of all applicable audit reports and written audit
agreements received by such Party or its Affiliates and relating to periods
for which the other Party is wholly or partially responsible.

two (2) Business Days after receipt of the Preliminary Settlement Statement,
Buyer will deliver to Seller a written report containing all changes, with
explanation therefor, that Buyer proposes to be made to the Preliminary
Settlement Statement. The Parties shall in good faith attempt to agree on the
Preliminary Settlement Statement as soon as possible after Sellers receipt
of Buyers written report. The Preliminary Settlement Statement, as agreed
upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing;
_provided_ that if the Parties do not agree upon an adjustment set forth in

settlement statement (the " _Final Settlement Statement_ ") will be prepared
by Seller, based on actual income and expenses during the Interim Period and
which takes into account all final adjustments made to the Purchase Price and
shows the resulting final Adjusted Purchase Price (the " _Final Price_ ").
The Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual proration of the
amounts required by this Agreement. Seller shall, at Buyers request, supply
reasonable documentation in its or its Affiliates possession available to
support the actual revenue, expenses and other items for which adjustments are
made. As soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days, after
receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
written report containing any proposed changes to the Final Settlement
Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons therefor (the
" _Dispute Notice_ "). Any changes not so specified in the Dispute Notice
shall be deemed waived, and Sellers determinations with respect to all such
elements of the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed specifically
in the Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Buyer fails to timely deliver a
Dispute Notice to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the
Final Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by
Seller will be deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon by the Parties,
and will, without limiting _Section_ __ _ 15.2(d)_, be final and binding on
the Parties and not subject to further audit or arbitration. If the Final
Price set forth in the Final Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by
Seller and Buyer, the Final Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall,
without limiting _Section_ __ _ 15.2(d) _or Buyers right to indemnity
under  _Section_ __ _ 13.2(d)_ for Seller Taxes, be final and binding on the
Parties, subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_. Any difference
in the Adjusted Purchase Price as paid at Closing pursuant to the Preliminary
Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be paid by the owing Party to
the owed Party within ten (10) days after final determination of such owed
amounts in accordance herewith. All amounts paid pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 3.6_ shall be delivered in United States currency by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by the
relevant Party.

 



11

    

(b) Subject to matters for which a Party has an indemnity obligation
pursuant to _Article_ __ _ XIII_ and subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_,
there shall be no adjustment for, or obligation to pay, any revenues,
proceeds, or Operating Expenses between the Parties following the eighteen
(18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Cut-Off Date_").

 

 _3.7_ _Disputes_. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters
addressed in the Dispute Notice (if any), within fifteen (15) Business Days
after Buyers delivery of a Dispute Notice, upon the written request of either
Buyer or Seller, Buyer and Seller shall engage the Denver office of Deloitte
LLP or such other Person as the Parties may mutually select (the "
_Accounting Arbitrator_ ") to resolve any such disputed matters set forth in
the Dispute Notice (other than Disputed Title Matters and Disputed
Environmental Matters) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each
of Buyer and Seller shall within twenty-five (25) Business Days after Buyers
delivery of such Dispute Notice summarize its position with regard to such
dispute in a written document and submit such summaries to the Accounting
Arbitrator, together with a copy of the Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement
Statement and any other documentation such Party may desire to submit. The
Parties shall cooperate diligently with any reasonable request of
the Accounting Arbitrator in an effort to resolve the matters submitted to
the Accounting Arbitrator as soon as reasonably possible after the Accounting
Arbitrator is engaged. Within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving the
Parties respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall render a
written decision choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position with
respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the materials
submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator as described above. Any decision
rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall, without limiting
_Section_ __ _ 15.2(d)_, be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and
Buyer, absent fraud or manifest error, and will be enforceable against the
Parties in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the Accounting
Arbitrator shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the disputes presented to it, shall be limited to the procedures
in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.7_, may not hear or decide any matters except the
disputes presented to it and may not award damages, interest, costs,
attorneys fees, expenses or penalties to either Party. In addition, the
Accounting Arbitrator shall agree in writing to keep strictly confidential
the specifics and existence of any matters submitted as well as all
proprietary records of the Parties, if any, reviewed by the Accounting
Arbitrator in the process of resolving such disputes.

_3.8_ _Allocation of Purchase Price/Allocated Values_.

 

(a) Buyer and Seller agree that the Purchase Price shall be allocated among
the Wells and the Well Locations as set forth in _Schedule 3.8A_ and
_Schedule 3.8B_ , as applicable (the " _Allocated Values_ "). Buyer and Seller
agree that (i) such allocation is reasonable, (ii) the Allocated Values shall
be used in calculating adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided herein,
(iii) the Allocated Values, as adjusted, shall be used by Seller and Buyer as
the basis for reporting asset values and other items for purposes of this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.8(a)_, __ and (iv) subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.8(b)_, they
shall not take any position inconsistent therewith, including in notices in
connection with Preferential Purchase Rights or in other documents or notices
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



12

    

(b) Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to
an allocation of the Purchase Price and any other items properly treated as
consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes among the Assets in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder and, to the extent allowed under applicable federal
income tax Law, in a manner consistent with the Allocated Values, within
thirty (30) days after the date that the Final Settlement Statement is
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ (the " _Allocation_ "). If Seller
and Buyer reach an agreement with respect to the Allocation, (i) Buyer and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Allocation in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code following the receipt of any Earnout
Payment or any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement,
and (ii) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, report
consistently with the Allocation, as adjusted, on all Tax Returns, including
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and neither Seller nor Buyer shall take
any position on any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Allocation,
as adjusted, unless otherwise required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Party shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability
and discretion to concede, negotiate, compromise and/or settle any Tax audit,
claim or similar proceedings in connection with such Allocation. If the
Parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after the date
that the Final Settlement Statement is finally determined, then each Party
shall be entitled to adopt its own position regarding the Allocation;
_provided_ that such position shall, to the extent allowed under applicable
federal income tax Law, be consistent with the Allocated Values.

 

 _3.9_ _Allocation for Imbalances at Closing_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, if, prior to Closing, either Party
discovers an error in the Imbalances set forth in _Schedule_ __ _ 4.12_,
then, as the applicable Partys sole remedy in respect of such error, the
Purchase Price shall be further adjusted at Closing pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.3(a)(v)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)(vi)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)(vii)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)(viii)_, as applicable, and  _Schedule_ __ _ 4.12_
will be deemed amended immediately prior to Closing to reflect the Imbalances
for which the Purchase Price is so adjusted. If, after Closing, any Imbalances
are discovered before the date that the Final Settlement Statement is agreed
upon, then the Party discovering such Imbalances shall notify the other
Parties and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, as the
applicable Partys sole remedy in respect of such error, the Parties shall
settle such Imbalances based on the formula set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.3(a)(v)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)(vi)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)(vii)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)(viii)_, as applicable, as part of the process described
in _Section_ __ _ 3.5_.

of Buyer, of each of the other parties thereto, except to the extent limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance,

or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a failure to satisfy a
condition precedent on the part of Buyer under the terms and conditions of the
Debt Commitment Letter or of Sponsor or Equity Investor under the terms and
conditions of the Equity Commitment Letters. Buyer

 has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be
paid pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter on or
before the date of this Agreement. None of the Commitment Letters or the Fee

the existence or exercise of "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee
Letter shall not be deemed to constitute a modification or amendment of the
Debt Commitment Letter) and, as of the date hereof, none of the commitments
under the Commitment Letters have been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect.

 

(f) As of the date hereof, the Forward Purchase Agreement is a valid and
binding obligation of Buyer Parent and, to the knowledge of Buyer Parent, of
each of the other parties thereto, except to the extent limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or
other similar Laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors
generally, or by general equitable principles. As of the date hereof, no event
has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would
reasonably be expected to constitute a failure to satisfy a
condition precedent on the part of Buyer Parent under the terms and
conditions of the Forward Purchase Agreement. The Forward Purchase Agreement
has not been modified or amended, as of the date hereof and, as of the date
hereof, none of the commitments under the Forward Purchase Agreement have

 _5.8_ _Regulatory_. Buyer is or will be at Closing qualified per

disqualified as such an owner or operator. To the extent required by any
applicable Laws, as of Closing, Buyer shall maintain, lease bonds, area-wide
bonds or any other surety bonds as may be required by, and in accordance with,
all applicable Laws governing the ownership and operation of the Assets and as

evaluated, the merits and risks of the Assets, Buyers acquisition, ownership
and operation thereof, and its obligations hereunder, and (c) is able to bear
the economic risks associated with the Assets, Buyers acquisition, ownership
and operation thereof, and its obligations hereunder. In making its decision

comments, statements, projections or other materials made or given by any
representatives or consultants or advisors of Seller, and (ii) has satisfied
itself through its own due diligence as to the environmental and physical
condition of and contractual arrangements and other matters affecting the
Assets.

shares of Buyer Parent Class A Common Stock, will have immediately prior to
the Closing) at least $552 million in the Buyer Parent Trust, with such funds
invested in cash, United States government securities or money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment

are no side letters and (except for the Buyer Parent Trust Agreement) there
are no agreements, contracts, arrangements or understandings, whether written
or oral, between Buyer Parent, on the one hand, and the Trustee or any other
Person, on the other hand, that would (a) cause the description of the Buyer
Parent Trust Agreement in Buyer Parents filings with the SEC to be inaccurate
in any material respect or (b) entitle any Person (other than holders of
Buyer Parent Class A Common Stock who shall have exercised their redemption
rights) to any portion of the proceeds in the Buyer Parent Trust. Prior to the
Closing, none of the funds held in the Buyer Parent Trust may be
released except as set forth in the Buyer Parent Trust Agreement.

Buyer acknowledges that Seller owns undivided interests in certain of the
properties comprising the Assets of which neither Seller nor its Affiliates
is the operator, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of any other
Working Interest owner or any other Person who is not Seller or an Affiliate
of Seller shall not constitute a breach of the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 6.1_, and no action required by a vote of Working Interest owners shall
constitute such a breach so long as Seller has voted its interest in a manner
that complies with the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_.

With respect to any AFE or similar request received by Seller that is
estimated to cost in excess of $300,000, Seller shall forward such AFE to
Buyer as soon as is reasonably practicable and thereafter the Parties shall
consult with each other regarding whether or not Seller should elect to
participate in such operation. Buyer agrees that it will timely respond to
any written request for consent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_. In the
event the Parties are unable to agree within five (5) days (unless a shorter
time is reasonably required by the circumstances or the applicable joint
operating agreement) of Buyers receipt of any consent request as to whether
or not Seller should elect to participate in such operation, Buyers decision
shall control and Seller shall vote its Working Interest or other voting
interests consistent with such decision.

From and after the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary (A) Seller shall have the right to control
and make adjustments with respect to Burdens paid by Seller to Governmental
Authorities, to the extent the same relate to pre-Effective Time periods,
in order to comply with applicable Laws and the terms of the Leases and any
relevant Contracts and Seller has agreed in writing after Closing or in this
Agreement that Seller is obligated hereunder to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties therefor, and (B) Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Sellers efforts and actions in
connection therewith.

 

 _6.2_ _Successor Operator_. While Buyer acknowledges that it desires to
succeed Seller (or its Affiliate) as operator of those Assets or portions
thereof that Seller (or its Affiliate) may presently operate, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot and does not covenant or warrant
that Buyer shall become successor operator of such Assets since the Assets or
portions thereof may be subject to operating or other agreements that control
the appointment of a successor operator. Seller agrees, however, that, as to
the Assets it (or its Affiliate) operates, it shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to support Buyers efforts to become successor operator of
such Assets (to the extent permitted under any applicable joint operating
agreement, Unit agreement, pooling order, or other applicable
agreement) effective as of Closing (at Buyers sole cost and expense) and to
designate and/or appoint, to the extent legally possible and permitted under,
and subject to any Third Partys right to resume operatorship under, any
applicable joint operating agreement, Unit agreement, pooling order, or other
applicable agreement, Buyer as successor operator of such Assets effective as
of Closing.

 

 _6.3_ _Governmental Bonds and Guarantees_.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that none of the bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees, if any, set forth on  _Schedule_ __ _ 6.3_, posted by Seller or
its Affiliates with any Governmental Authority or any non-governmental Third
Party and relating to the Assets (the " _Bonds_ ") are transferable to Buyer.
On or before the Closing Date, Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in
the name of Buyer, replacements for such Bonds to the extent such

 



29

    

 replacements are necessary (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) to permit the cancellation of such Bonds posted by
Seller and/or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Assets. In addition,
at or prior to Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller evidence of the posting
of bonds or other security with all applicable Governmental Authorities and
all applicable Third Parties meeting the requirements of such Governmental
Authorities and such Third Parties to own and, if applicable, operate the
Assets.

 

(b) In the event that any Governmental Authority or any Third Party does
not permit the cancellation of any Bond posted by Seller and/or any Affiliate
thereof with respect to the Assets, then, from and after Closing, without
limiting Buyers right to indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.2_,
Buyer shall indemnify Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, against all
amounts incurred by Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, under such Bond
(and all costs incurred in connection with such Bond) to the extent applicable
to the Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any cash placed in escrow by Seller or any Affiliate thereof in
connection with the Bonds must be returned to Seller, and shall be deemed an
Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder.

 

 _6.4_ _Amendment to Schedules_. Each of Buyer and Buyer Parent agrees
that, with respect to the representations and warranties of Seller contained
in this Agreement, Seller shall have the continuing right until Closing to
add, supplement or amend the Schedules to its representations and warranties
with respect to any act, omission or occurrence, to the extent occurring
after (and not before) the Execution Date, which, if existing on the Execution
Date, would have been required to be set forth or described in such Schedules.
For all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining
whether the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_ have been fulfilled,
the Schedules to Sellers representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein
on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained
in any addition, supplement or amendment thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if Closing shall occur, then all matters disclosed pursuant to any such
addition, supplement or amendment at or prior to Closing shall be waived
solely as to _Section_ __ _ 13.2(a)_ but shall not be waived for purposes of
_Section_ __ _ 13.2(b)_ through  _(d)_ and Buyer shall be entitled to make
a claim pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.2(b)_ through _(d)_ with respect
thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if the conditions to
Closing of Buyer set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_ are not fulfilled, and
nonetheless Buyer elects to proceed with Closing, and the Closing shall occur,
then all matters disclosed pursuant to any such addition, supplement or
amendment at or prior to Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.2_ shall be
waived for all purposes and Buyer shall not be entitled to make a claim with
respect thereto pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 13.2_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, should Seller add to, supplement or amend
the matters disclosed on _Schedule 4.7_ as of the Execution Date, such
addition, supplement or amendment shall, if the matters disclosed by such
addition, supplement or amendment (i) constitute Part 1 Litigation, be made
to _Part 1 of Schedule_ __ _ 4.7_, or (ii) do not constitute Part 1
Litigation, be made to a new _Part 3 of Schedule_ __ _ 4.7_.

 

 _6.5_ _Records Retention_. Buyer shall and shall cause its successors
and assigns to, for a period of five (5) years following Closing (or, in the
case of Records related to Tax matters, until the expiration of the period of
time set forth in the applicable statute of limitations), (a) retain the
Records, (b) provide Seller and its officers, employees and representatives
with reasonable access

 



30

    

 to the Records during normal business hours for review and copying at
Sellers expense, and (c) provide Seller and its officers, employees and
representatives with reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
materials received or produced after Closing relating to any indemnity claim
made under _Article XIII_ for review and copying at Sellers expense.

 

 _6.6_ _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Seller and Buyer shall (x) make or cause to be made appropriate filings
of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than ten (10) Business Days, after the Execution Date, and Seller and
Buyer shall bear their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with such
filings and compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_; _provided_ that Buyer
and Seller shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of any filing fees in
connection therewith, and (y) use their commercially reasonable efforts to
respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for additional
information made by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the
" _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other
Governmental Authority, to take all actions necessary to cause the waiting
periods under the HSR Act and any other Laws to terminate or expire at the
earliest possible date but in no event later than the Outside Date, to resist
in good faith, at each of their respective cost and expense, any assertion
that the transactions contemplated hereby constitute a violation of Laws, and
to eliminate every impediment under any Laws that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible in accordance herewith, all to the end of expediting
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In connection with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_, the Parties shall, to the extent permitted by Laws, (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing,
submission, investigation or inquiry, (ii) absent an objection from a
Governmental Authority, provide advance notice and allow the other Party to
participate in every communication with a Governmental Authority; _provided_
 that this clause shall not apply to a communication initiated by the
Governmental Authority without advance notice to a Party, in which case the
next clause shall apply, (iii) promptly inform the other Party of any
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the DOJ
or the FTC or any other Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case, regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv)
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each shall
consult the other on, any filing made with, or written materials to be
submitted to, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, any other Person, in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (v) consult with
each other in advance of any meeting, discussion, telephone call or conference
with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person. Each Party
shall provide the other with information that is reasonably requested and that
is reasonably necessary to obtain the expiration of the waiting period under
the HSR Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party would be required to
share information that (A) is subject to the attorney-client or work product
privilege, absent entry of a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement or
(B) reflects the value of the transaction.

 



31

    

(b) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, take reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or early termination
of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is practicable
but in no event later than the Outside Date. Buyer and Seller shall jointly
determine all strategy with regard to any provision of the foregoing;
_provided_ that nothing in this Agreement obligates Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or Seller or any of its Affiliates to agree to divest, hold
separate or otherwise take any action that limits the ability of Buyer or its
Affiliates or Seller or any of its Affiliates to operate or retain its own
assets or businesses, or the Assets. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any
action that will delay obtaining the expiration of the HSR Act waiting period
and neither shall withdraw or refile any filing under the HSR Act without the
approval of the other Party.

 

 _6.7_ [ _Intentionally Deleted._ ]

 

 _6.8_ _Employees_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer and its Affiliates may, on or after the
Execution Date and at reasonable times approved by Seller, interview any
employee of Seller or its Affiliates set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 6.8_ (each,
a " _Permitted Employee_ ") and conduct those lawful, standard employee
screening and eligibility procedures with regard to the potential employment
of any Permitted Employee as Buyer or any such Affiliate conducts with respect
to candidates for employment in its ordinary course of business, provided,
however, that Buyer shall not require any Permitted Employee to submit an
application as a predicate for being considered for an employment offer
(though any employment offer may be conditioned upon Buyers standard pre-
employment screenings, including background checks and submission of a
resume). Promptly following (i) Buyer or its Affiliates making an offer of
employment to any Permitted Employee, and (ii) any such Permitted Employee
accepting his or her offer of employment from Buyer or its Affiliates, in each
case, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of the same in order that Seller
can appropriately comply with its obligations in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_.
Seller may not supplement or amend _Schedule 6.8_ for a period of thirty (30)
days following the Execution Date without the prior written consent of Buyer.
Thereafter, Seller may supplement or amend  _Schedule_ __ _ 6.8_ at any time
prior to the Closing in order to add or delete certain individuals to or from
_Schedule_ __ _ 6.8_; _provided_ , _however_ , that no individual to whom
Buyer and its Affiliates have made an offer of employment may be removed from
such Schedule. Buyer and its Affiliates may conduct interviews and screening
of the Permitted Employees from the Execution Date until thirty (30) days
before the Closing Date;  _provided_ that such interviewing and screening
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business of Seller or its
Affiliates. Seller shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Buyer and its Affiliates to facilitate the completion of the interview
and screening procedures hereunder.

(b) After the Execution Date, and as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)_
above, Buyer and its Affiliates shall be authorized to communicate with any
Permitted Employee regarding such Permitted Employees potential employment
with Buyer or its Affiliate and Buyer and its Affiliates shall be authorized
to communicate any offer of employment to any Permitted Employees, with such
employment offers to be conditioned upon the

 



32

    

 Closing and effective as of the Closing Date or, in the case of a Permitted
Employee who will be performing services under the Transition Services
Agreement (a " _TSA Employee_ "), as of the date of the expiration or early
termination under the Transition Services Agreement of the group(s) of
services such Permitted Employee will perform (his or her applicable " _TSA_
_Service Termination Date_ "). Any such offers of employment must, unless
otherwise agreed by Seller, not result in a reduction in the Permitted
Employees base salary or base wages as compared to the base salary or base
wages in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer shall, not later than
twenty (20) days before the Scheduled Closing Date, deliver to Seller a final
written list containing the name of each Permitted Employee to whom Buyer or
any of its Affiliates has made an employment offer. Buyer shall also provide
to Seller, not later than twenty (20) days prior to the Scheduled Closing
Date, the names of each Permitted Employee who has then accepted an employment
offer from Buyer or any of its Affiliates (each Permitted Employee who
accepts such an offer and assumes employment with Buyer or its Affiliate on or
following the Closing being a " _Continuing Employee_ ") and the names of the
Permitted Employees who have then declined an employment offer from Buyer or
its Affiliate. Each Continuing Employee shall, as of the Closing Date or, in
the case of a TSA Employee, as of their applicable TSA Services Termination
Date (if he or she is still employed by Seller or its Affiliate), be
terminated by Seller or its Affiliate and become an employee of Buyer or its
Affiliate. Between the Execution Date and twenty (20) days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates to
not) terminate any Permitted Employee who has received an employment offer
from Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than for cause or with Buyers

delayed). Seller shall not induce or otherwise attempt to influence any such
Permitted Employee to resign or to not accept his or her offer of employment
from Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 

(c) Seller shall be responsible for all compensation and benefits owing to
Continuing Employees arising on or prior to the Closing Date or, in the case
of a TSA Employee, as of their applicable TSA Services Termination Date (or,
if earlier, the date a Continuing Employee ceases employment with Seller or
its Affiliate) and for all compensation and benefits owing to Permitted
Employees not hired by Buyer or its Affiliates. Buyer or its Affiliate, as
applicable, shall be responsible for all compensation and benefits owing to
Continuing Employees arising on or after their hiring by Buyer or
such Affiliate (including after the Closing Date or, in the case of a TSA
Employee, after their applicable TSA Services Termination Date) and resulting
from such Continuing Employees employment with Buyer or its Affiliate. Seller
shall be responsible and pay for any obligation arising out of the WARN Act
with respect to any employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including any
Permitted Employees laid off on or prior to the Closing Date); _provided_ that
Buyer or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall be responsible and pay for any
obligation arising out of the WARN Act and owed to any Continuing Employees
laid off by Buyer or its Affiliate after the Closing Date or, in the case of a
TSA Employee, after their applicable TSA Services Termination Date. Buyer
shall not take any act (or omit to take any act) on or after the Closing Date
that creates any Liability for Seller or any of its Affiliates under the WARN
Act.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of Buyer or its
Affiliates to (i) offer employment to, or hire, any Permitted Employee, (ii)
except as expressly provided herein, offer or provide specified levels of
compensation or benefits to Permitted Employees or (iii) continue the
employment of any employee for any definite period following the Closing Date
or, in the case of a TSA Employee, after their applicable TSA Services

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 15.10_, no provision
in this Agreement shall create any Third-Party beneficiary or other right in
any Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) for any reason in
respect of continued employment or new employment with Seller or its
Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates or in respect of any benefits that may
be provided, directly or indirectly, under any plan or arrangement maintained
by Seller or Buyer or its Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_,
express or implied, shall be deemed an amendment of any Employee Benefit Plan
providing benefits to any Permitted Employee or any other employee of Seller
or its Affiliates. Each Party hereby agrees not to, and, with respect to
Seller, to cause its Affiliates or anyone acting on Sellers or any of its
Affiliates behalf not to, and, with respect to Buyer, to cause each member of
the Buyer Group or anyone acting on Buyers or any member of the Buyer Groups
behalf not to, for two (2) years after the Execution Date, directly or
indirectly (other than as permitted by _Sections_ __ _ 6.8(a)_ and _6.8(b)_
hereof): solicit or contact with a view to the engagement or employment of,
any employee of the other Party or its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that it shall not be a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8(e)_ to engage in
solicitations incidental to general advertising or other general solicitation
in the ordinary course not specifically targeted at such Persons or to employ
any Person not solicited in violation hereof. In addition, except pursuant to
an offer of employment extended to a Permitted Employee prior to the Closing
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_, for
a period of six (6) months following the Closing Date, without Sellers
consent, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, hire
or otherwise employ any Permitted Employee to which Buyer did not make an
offer of employment.

 

 _6.9_ _Transition Services Agreement_. The Parties shall enter into at
Closing the Transition Services Agreement substantially in the form set forth
on _Exhibit J_ (the " _Transition Services Agreement_ "); _provided_ that,
with respect to the items on the Schedules thereto which the Parties fail to

a " _Specified_

 



34

    

  _H_ __ _edging Agreement_ "); _provided_ that (i) the notional monthly
quantities associated with all such Specified Hedging Agreements are, in
the aggregate, no greater than those listed on _Schedule_ __ _ 6.10_ and on
market terms, (ii) the Specified Hedging Agreements are executed solely with
counterparties listed on _Schedule_ __ _ 6.10_ as a transaction under such
counterparties existing ISDA Master Agreement with Seller or its Affiliate,
(iii) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay to any
counterparty any fee to authorize the initiation of any Specified Hedging
Agreement (unless Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller or its applicable Affiliate
for such fee), (iv) the Specified Hedging Agreement provides (A) for the
novation of the obligations thereunder to the Buyer, (B) a right of Seller or
its applicable Affiliate, in its sole discretion, to terminate the
transactions thereunder if Closing does not occur or (C) a requirement to
terminate the transactions thereunder if Closing occurs and a Novation Failure
Unwinding Scenario occurs with respect thereto, and (v) Buyer has delivered
such instructions at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing.
Neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall authorize the initiation of any

any Specified Hedging Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_
and the proposed counterparty thereto fails to authorize the initiation of
such Specified Hedging Agreement, Seller shall not be in breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_ for such counterpartys failure to authorize the
initiation of such Specified Hedging Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to the earlier of the (x) novation of a Specified Hedging
Agreement to Buyer at Closing or (y) if applicable, the unwinding of such
Specified Hedging Agreement after the occurrence of a Novation Failure
Unwinding Scenario, Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall (i) comply with
such Specified Hedging Agreement and (ii) not execute or deliver any
amendment for, or waiver of any right under, such Specified Hedging Agreement,

that Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall execute and deliver any such
amendment or waiver or effect any such transfer or termination in accordance
with any written request delivered by Buyer to Seller and consistent with
_Schedule_ __ _ 6.10_.

 

(d) In the event that (i) the Seller Termination Unwinding Scenario occurs
and any Elected Unwind Hedge is actually unwound or terminated by Seller or
its applicable Affiliate pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.10(f)_, or (ii) Closing
occurs (whether or not a Novation Failure Unwinding Scenario occurs), in each
case, Buyer and Buyer Parent shall (without duplication of any Purchase Price
adjustments pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)(x)_ or _Section_ __ _
3.3(b)(x)_, as applicable), on a joint and several basis, pay, be responsible
for, defend, indemnify, hold harmless and forever release Seller and its
Affiliates from and against any and all Liabilities of, or payable by, Seller
or its Affiliates (i) to any counterparty listed on _Schedule_ __ _

35

    

 any Specified Hedging Agreement pursuant to a Novation Failure Unwinding

Unwinding Scenario (collectively, the " _Hedging Indemnities_ ").

(e) In the event Closing occurs and any Specified Hedging Agreement is not
novated to Buyer or its Affiliates for any reason whatsoever other than as a
result of any breach of this Agreement by Seller or its Affiliates (a "
_Novation Failure Unwinding Scenario_ "), then Seller or its applicable

then Seller or its applicable Affiliate may (but shall not be required to),
at the sole cost and expense of Buyer, unwind and liquidate all or any portion
of the Specified Hedging Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby
in accordance with the terms of the applicable Specified Hedging Agreements.
In the event the Seller Termination Unwinding Scenario occurs, Seller shall
deliver written notice to Buyer of its (or its applicable Affiliates)
election whether or not to unwind and liquidate all or any portion of
the Specified Hedging Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby
within thirty (30) days following termination of this Agreement, and only
those Specified Hedging Agreements that Seller (or its applicable Affiliate)

") shall be subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.10(h)(ii)(A)_, and
all other Specified Hedging Agreements (" _Elected Retained Hedges_ ") shall
instead be subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.10(g)_ and _Section_ __ _
6.10(h)(ii)(B)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.10(h)(iii)_.

 

(g) If this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing (other than in the
event of the Seller Termination Unwinding Scenario with respect to the
Elected Unwind Hedges), then Seller shall retain, pay, be responsible for,
defend, indemnify, hold harmless and forever release Buyer and its Affiliates
from and against any and all Hedging Indemnities.

_Section_ __ _ 6.10(h)(ii)(A)_); _provided_ , _however_ , any payments
required of Buyer under _Section_ __ _ 6.10(h)(ii)(A)_ shall be made net of
any amounts owed by Seller under _Section_ __ _ 6.10(h)(ii)(B)_, and (iii)
in the event _Section_ __ _ 6.10(g)_ applies, subject to _Section_ __ _
6.10(h)(ii)_, Seller shall be entitled to and responsible for, as applicable,

Specified Hedging Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby and
the actions to be taken by the Parties in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ are an exception to, and will under no

consult with Buyer regarding any such fee prior to agreeing to pay such fee.
If Seller or its applicable Affiliate has executed and delivered any Novation
Instrument in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ and the proposed
counterparty thereto or Buyer fails to execute and deliver such Novation
Instrument, Seller and its Affiliates shall not be in breach of this _Section_

BUYER AND BUYER PARENT, ON A JOINT AND SEVERAL BASIS, SHALL DEFEND,
INDEMNIFY, HOLD HARMLESS AND FOREVER RELEASE THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES
FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, LOSSES, DAMAGES, CLAIMS, COSTS,

_6.15_ _Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
proceeds of the Debt Financing on terms and conditions no less favorable to
Buyer than the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
and, in the case of Buyer, the Fee Letter (including any "market flex"
provisions in the Fee Letter), including commercially reasonable efforts to,
as applicable, (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter (subject to
Buyers right to amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign, substitute or
replace the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance herewith), (ii) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing having terms and
conditions no less favorable to Buyer than the terms and conditions contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter (including any "market flex"
provisions contained in the Fee Letter) and (iii) taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period, satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) on a
timely basis all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter that are within
Buyers control. Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (A) permit any
amendment, supplement or modification to, or any waiver of any
material provision or remedy under, or replace, the Debt Commitment Letter if
such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or replacement (1) would be
reasonably expected to materially delay the funding of the Debt Financing or
make the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing
materially less likely to occur, (2) reduces the amount of the Debt Financing
if Buyer does not otherwise have sufficient cash proceeds to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses at Closing, (3) materially and adversely affects the ability of Buyer
to enforce their respective rights against any of the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or
replaced, relative to the ability of Buyer to enforce their respective rights
against any of such other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect
on the date hereof or (4) adds new (or modifies any existing) conditions to
the consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the
Closing; _provided_ that Buyer may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement without any consent of the Seller or (B) terminate the Debt
Commitment Letter (unless the Debt Commitment Letter has been replaced by a
new commitment letter (or similar agreement) in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 6.15_). Upon any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 6.15(a)_, the terms "Debt Commitment Letter", "Debt Financing,"
"Commitment Letters," and "Financing" shall refer to the Debt Commitment
Letter as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced and the debt
financing contemplated thereby.

 



41

    

(b) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter and Fee Letter (including any "market flex" provisions contained in the
Fee Letter) for any reason (other than due to the failure of a condition to
the consummation of the Debt Financing resulting from a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Seller set forth in
this Agreement), Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and in any
event no later than the last day of the Marketing Period), alternative
financing (as applicable, in an amount sufficient to permit Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related
fees and expenses at the Closing) from the same or other sources and on terms
and conditions not less favorable to Buyer than the terms and conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter (including any "market
flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter). For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative
financing arranged in compliance herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter
remaining in effect at the time in question) and the term "Debt Financing"
shall be deemed to include any alternative financing arranged in compliance
herewith. Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed on a current basis of
the status of their efforts to consummate the Debt Financing.

 

(c) Buyer Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the proceeds called for from the Sponsor under the Forward Purchase Agreement
on terms and conditions no less favorable to Buyer Parent than the terms and
conditions described in the Forward Purchase Agreement, including commercially
reasonable efforts to, as applicable, (i) maintain in effect the Forward
Purchase Agreement and (ii) satisfy (or obtain a waiver of) on a timely basis
all conditions in the Forward Purchase Agreement that are within Buyer
Parents control. Buyer Parent shall not, without the prior written consent
of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (A)
permit any amendment, supplement or modification to, or any waiver of any
material provision or remedy under, or replace, the Forward
Purchase Agreement if such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
replacement (1) would be reasonably expected to materially delay the purchase
obligations of the Sponsor under the Forward Purchase Agreement or make the
satisfaction of the conditions to Sponsors purchase obligations under the
Forward Purchase Agreement materially less likely to occur, (2) reduces the
amount of Forward Purchase Units the Sponsor is required to purchase under the
Forward Purchase Agreement if Buyer and Buyer Parent do not otherwise have
sufficient cash proceeds to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses at Closing, (3) materially and
adversely affects the ability of Buyer Parent to enforce its rights against
any of the other parties to the Forward Purchase Agreement, relative to the
ability of Buyer Parent to enforce its respective rights against any of such
other parties to the Forward Purchase Agreement as in effect on the date
hereof or (4) adds new (or modifies any existing) conditions to the Sponsors
purchase obligations under the Forward Purchase Agreement in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the
receipt of the aggregate Forward Purchase Price (as defined in the Forward
Purchase Agreement) from the Sponsor under the Forward Purchase Agreement, or
(B) terminate the Forward Purchase Agreement.

(d) Buyer and Buyer Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause Sponsor to obtain the proceeds called for from the Equity Investor
under the Forward Purchase Agreement on terms and conditions no less favorable
to Sponsor than the terms and conditions described in the Equity Commitment
Letters, including commercially reasonable efforts to, as applicable, (i)
maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letters and (ii) satisfy (or obtain a
waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions in the Equity Commitment Letters
that are within Sponsors control. Buyer, Buyer Parent and Sponsor shall not,
without the prior written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (A) permit any amendment, supplement or
modification to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, or
replace, the Equity Commitment Letters if such amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or replacement (1) would be reasonably expected to
materially delay the purchase obligations of the Equity Investor under the
Equity Commitment Letters or make the satisfaction of the conditions to Equity
Investors purchase obligations under the Equity Commitment Letters materially
less likely to occur, (2) reduces the amount of equity commitment of the
Equity Investor under the Equity Commitment Letters if Buyer and Buyer Parent
do not otherwise have sufficient cash proceeds to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses at
Closing, (3) materially and adversely affects the ability of Sponsor to
enforce its rights against the Equity Investor under the Equity Commitment
Letters, relative to the ability of Sponsor to enforce its respective
rights against Equity Investor under the Equity Commitment Letters as in
effect on the date hereof or (4) adds new (or modifies any existing)
conditions to the Equity Investors purchase obligations under the Equity
Commitment Letters in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede or materially delay the receipt of the aggregate Forward Purchase Price
(as defined in the Forward Purchase Agreement) from the Sponsor under the
Forward Purchase Agreement, or (B) terminate the Equity Commitment Letters.
Upon any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or replacement of
any Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.15(d)_,
the terms "Equity Commitment Letters," "Equity Financing," "Commitment
Letters," and "Financing" shall refer to the Equity Commitment Letter, as
applicable, as so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced and the
equity financing, as applicable, contemplated thereby.

in connection with the preparation of the Financial Statements required by
this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_.

 

 _6.17_ _FCC Filings_. __ Each Party shall prepare, as soon as is
practical following the Execution Date, any necessary filings in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that may be reasonably
required by any Governmental Authority under applicable Laws or a Party
hereunder to be filed by such Party with the Federal Communications

annexes thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") in preliminary form.

 

(b) Buyer Parent shall provide copies of the proposed forms of the Offer
Documents to Seller such that Seller and its representatives are afforded a
reasonable amount of time prior to the dissemination or filing thereof to
review such material and comment thereon prior to such dissemination or
filing, and Buyer Parent shall reasonably consider in good faith any comments
of such Persons and shall make Buyer Parents representatives available to
discuss such comments with such Persons. Buyer Parent shall provide Seller and
its representatives with copies of any written comments and inform them of
the material terms of any oral comments that Buyer Parent or any of its
representatives receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall give Seller a
reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to review and comment on any
proposed written or material oral responses to such comments and Buyer Parent
shall reasonably consider in good faith any such comments. Buyer Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to "clear"
comments from the SEC and its staff and to permit Seller and its
representatives to participate with Buyer Parent or its representatives in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC and its staff. Seller shall make its
directors, officers and employees, upon reasonable advance notice, available
to Buyer Parent and its representatives in connection with the drafting of the
public filings with respect to the Transactions (including the Offer

Parent and Seller shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents.

 

(c) Buyer Parent shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in
connection with the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with

any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC, NASDAQ or the
respective staff thereof that is applicable to the Offer. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.20(c)_ shall (i) impose any obligation on Buyer Parent to
extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date, or (ii) be deemed to impair,
limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Buyer to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Article XIV_.

 

(d) Buyer Parent shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
holders of Buyer Parent Common Stock, as of the record date established by
Buyer Parents Board of Directors within five (5) Business Days following (i)
in the event the preliminary Proxy Statement is not reviewed by the SEC, the
expiration of the waiting period in Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act, or
(ii) in the event the preliminary Proxy Statement is reviewed by the SEC,
receipt of oral or written notification of completion of such review by the
SEC.

 

(e) Seller shall promptly provide to Buyer Parent such information
concerning Seller and the Assets as is required for inclusion in the Offer
Documents or reasonably requested by Buyer Parent for inclusion in the Offer
Documents. If at any time prior to the

 



45

    

 Closing, any information relating to Seller, the Assets, or any of Sellers
subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by Buyer
Parent or Seller, as applicable, that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Offer Documents, so that such documents would not include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify each other Party hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
by Buyer Parent with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
by Buyer Parent to the stockholders of Buyer Parent.

 

(f) Subject to the second sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.20(f)_,
but notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement or any
Offer Document, Buyer Parent shall not make any public filing with respect to
the Transactions (including, without limitation, the Offer Documents) without
the prior written consent of Seller. Buyer Parent may make any public filing
with respect to the Transactions to the extent required by applicable Law;
provided that Seller shall, in any event, be consulted in order to determine
the extent to which any such filing is required by applicable Law and to the
extent such filing is jointly determined by Seller and Buyer Parent to be not
so required, such filing shall not be made; and provided further, that with
respect to all filings made with respect to the Transactions, Buyer Parent
shall give Seller a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
proposed filing and Buyer Parent shall reasonably consider in good faith any
such comments.

 

 _6.21 Special Meeting; Recommendation of the Board of Buyer Parent._

 

(a) Buyer Parent will take, in accordance with applicable Law, NASDAQ rules
and the Buyer Parent Governing Documents, all action necessary to call, hold
and convene a special meeting of holders of Buyer Parent Common Stock
(including any permitted adjournment or postponement, the " _Special Meeting_
") to consider and vote upon (i) the adoption and approval of this Agreement
and the Transactions by the holders of Buyer Parent Common Stock, (ii) the
adoption and approval of the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and (iii) any and all other approvals that Buyer Parent,
subject to the approval of Seller (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), deems necessary or advisable to effect the consummation
of the Transactions, including any amendment to the Buyer Parent Governing
Documents to extend the prescribed time period in which Buyer Parent is
required to consummate a Business Combination (collectively, the "
_Stockholder Proposals_ "), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
filing of the Proxy Statement in definitive form with the SEC. Except as
expressly required or permitted by the terms of this Agreement or consented to
in writing by Seller, from and after the date of this Agreement, Buyer Parent
shall not directly or indirectly submit any other transaction or matter to
any vote, consent or approval of the holders of Buyer Parent Common Stock.

 

(b) The Board of Directors of Buyer Parent shall recommend that holders of
Buyer Parent Common Stock approve the Stockholder Proposals, and Buyer Parent
shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that

 



46

    

 notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to obtaining the
required stockholder approval at the Special Meeting, there shall be no limit
or restriction on Buyer Parents Board of Directors right to withdraw,
amend, qualify or modify its recommendation based on such Board of Directors
good faith determination, after consultation with its outside legal advisors
and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would constitute a breach
of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law (any such withdrawal,
amendment, qualification or modification, a " _Change in Recommendation_ ").
Buyer Parent shall promptly notify Seller in writing of any determination to
make a Change in Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, any Change in
Recommendation will not (i) change the approval of this Agreement or any
other approval of the Board of Directors of Buyer Parent or (ii) relieve
Buyer or Buyer Parent of any of their obligations under this Agreement,
including Buyer Parents obligation to hold the Special Meeting.

 

 _6.22_ _Business Combination Proposal_. Promptly following the Execution
Date, Buyer and Buyer Parent shall, and shall cause their Affiliates and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to, cease any discussions with any Person regarding any
Business Combination Proposal that are ongoing as of the Execution Date.

(a) From the Execution Date through the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article_ __ _ XIV_, Buyer
and Buyer Parent shall not, shall cause their Affiliates not to, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) enter into, knowingly solicit, initiate, or
continue any discussions or negotiations with, or knowingly encourage any
inquiries or proposals by, or participate in any negotiations with, or provide
any non-public information to any Person concerning any Business Combination
Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person any non-public information with respect
to, or commence, continue or renew any due diligence investigation regarding,
any Business Combination Proposal, or (iii) enter into any agreement
regarding, or approve or recommend any agreement with respect to, any Business
Combination Proposal.

 

(b) _No Claim Against Buyer Parent Trust_. __ Seller acknowledges that, as
described in the Prospectus, Buyer Parent has established the Buyer Parent
Trust from the proceeds of its initial public offering (" _IPO_ ") and from
certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO for the
benefit of Buyer Parents public stockholders (" _Public Stockholders_ ") and
certain Persons (including the underwriters of the IPO) and that it has been
advised by Buyer Parent that, except for a portion of the interest earned on
the amounts held in the Buyer Parent Trust, Buyer Parent may disburse monies
from the Buyer Parent Trust only: (i) to the Public Stockholders in the event
they elect to redeem the Buyer Parent Class A Common Stock in connection with
the consummation of Buyer Parents initial business combination (as such term
is used in the Prospectus) (" _Business Combination_ "); (ii) to the Public
Stockholders if Buyer Parent fails to consummate a Business
Combination within twenty-four (24) months from the closing of the IPO; (iii)
to pay any Taxes; or (iv) to, or on behalf of, Buyer Parent after or
concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination. Seller hereby
agrees that, it does not now and shall not at any time hereafter have (other
than its rights upon Closing,

 



47

    

 including those that may be applicable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
14.2(b)(B)_) any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
monies in the Buyer Parent Trust or distributions therefrom, or make any
claim prior to Closing against the Buyer Parent Trust, regardless of whether
such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal
liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as
the " _Claims_ "). Seller hereby irrevocably waives any Claims it may have
against the Buyer Parent Trust (including any distributions therefrom) now or
in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with Buyer Parent and will not, prior to the Closing, seek
recourse against the Buyer Parent Trust (including any distributions
therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of
this Agreement), other than in connection with enforcing its rights pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 14.2(b)(B)_. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the waivers under this  _Section_
__ _ 6.23_ will continue to apply at and after the Closing to distributions
made to redeeming Public Stockholders and for transaction expenses paid
(including deferred expenses payable to Buyer Parents underwriters in
connection with the IPO). Seller agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable
waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by Buyer
Parent to induce it to enter into this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, (A) nothing herein shall serve to limit or
prohibit Sellers right to pursue a claim against Buyer Parent for legal
relief against monies or other assets held outside the Buyer Parent Trust and
(B) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that Seller
may have in the future against Buyer Parents assets or funds that are not
held in the Buyer Parent Trust and any assets that have been purchased or
acquired with any such funds.

 

(c) _Buyer Parent Trust_ _._ Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in  _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_ and provision of notice
thereof by Buyer Parent to the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the
Buyer Parent Trust Agreement, (i) in accordance with and pursuant to the Buyer
Parent Trust Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer Parent shall cause the
documents and notices required to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to the
Buyer Parent Trust Agreement to be so delivered and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall thereupon
be obligated to (A) pay as and when due all amounts payable to holders of
Buyer Parent Class A Common Stock, and (B) immediately thereafter, pay all
remaining amounts then available in the Buyer Parent Trust in accordance with
this Agreement and the Buyer Parent Trust Agreement, and (ii) thereafter, the
Buyer Parent Trust shall terminate, except as otherwise provided in the Buyer
Parent Trust Agreement.

 

 _6.23_ _Consent Agreement_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including
in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, (i) Seller may proceed to finalize and negotiate
the terms of the Draft Agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(the " _EPA_ ") prior to Closing to come to a final, executable form of the
Draft Agreement (such final form, the " _Consent Agreement_ "), and (ii) to
the extent that the terms of the Consent Agreement are not more restrictive or
punitive on Seller (or Sellers successors and assigns) than the terms of the
Draft Agreement (any such more restrictive or punitive term, an " _Adverse
Deviation_ "), Seller shall not be required to receive the prior consent of
Buyer or Buyer Parent to finalize

 



48

    

 and execute the Consent Agreement with the EPA. However, if the terms of the
Consent Agreement do contain an Adverse Deviation, then Buyers prior consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) will
be required for Seller to finalize and enter into the Consent Agreement with
the EPA.

 

(b) From and after the date hereof until the execution of the Consent
Agreement, Seller agrees to (i) provide Buyer and Buyer Parent with any
revisions to the Draft Agreement that may be transmitted by Seller to the EPA
or from the EPA to Seller, in each case, promptly following Sellers receipt
or delivery of the same, (ii) keep Buyer and Buyer Parent aware of any
material developments in the negotiation and finalization of the Consent
Agreement, in each case, that would be reasonably likely, in Sellers good
faith opinion, to result in an Adverse Deviation, and (iii) prior to
executing the same, provide Buyer and Buyer Parent with the proposed Consent
Agreement, which delivery shall be accompanied by either (A) a consent request
to Buyer with respect to the execution of such Consent Agreement, if and to
the extent the same includes an Adverse Deviation, or (B) a statement that
such Consent Agreement does not contain an Adverse Deviation and that Seller
intends to proceed with the execution of the Consent Agreement in such form.

 

(c) Upon the finalization and execution of the Consent Agreement by Seller
and the EPA, the Parties shall enter into an amendment of this Agreement in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit K_.

 

 _6.24_ _Credit Agreement Consent_. Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent,
waiver and amendment of the Seller Parent Credit Agreement by the requisite
Lenders (as defined in the Seller Parent Credit Agreement) in order to permit
thereunder the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder and
the performance of Sellers obligations and conveants to be performed at
Closing, including, in the event Seller fails to obtain any of the applicable
Subject Consents with respect to any of the Schedule 6.18 Assets prior to the
Closing, Sellers execution and delivery of the Mortgage at Closing and
Sellers performance of the covenants and obligations of the Seller under
_Section_ __ _ 6.18_, Schedule 6.18 and the Mortgage (such consent, waiver
and amendment, the " _Credit Agreement Consent_ "). Prior to the execution of
the Credit Agreement Consent, Seller shall provide Purchaser draft copies of
the Credit Agreement Consent and the opportunity to provide comments to the
same, which comments shall be considered in good faith by Seller and its
Affilaites; _provided, however_ , in no event shall Seller be obligated to
accept any such comments. Seller shall provide to Purchaser a fully executed
copy of the Credit Agreement Consent promptly after the execution and delivery
thereof by the applicable parties thereto.

 

 _6.25_ _Registration Rights Agreement_. Promptly following the Execution
Date and through the earliest to occur of (a) the Closing Date, (b) the
Termination Date and (c) the date on which the Parties agree that the form of
the Registration Rights Agreement is finalized, Buyer Parent and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith the form of the Registration Rights Agreement (the "
_Registration Rights Agreement_ "), which Registration Rights Agreement will
be on terms as are consistent with and do not deviate from those set forth on
_Exhibit O_ attached hereto and on such other reasonable and customary terms
as are mutually agreed to by Buyer Parent and Seller; _provided_ that such
other reasonable and customary terms are not inconsistent with and do not
deviate with those set forth on  _Exhibit O_ attached hereto.

implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to Sellers title to any of the
Assets, and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyers sole remedy for
any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the
Assets (i) before Closing, shall be as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ and
(ii) after Closing, shall be pursuant to the special warranty of title set
forth in the Assignment.

 

(b) _Special Warranty of Title_. The Assignment delivered at Closing will
contain a special warranty of title whereby Seller warrants and agrees to
defend Defensible Title effective as of Closing and until the end of the
Survival Period, without duplication, to (i) each Well set forth on _Exhibit_
__ _ B-1_ (limited to any currently producing formations), and (ii) each Well
Location set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-2_ (limited to the applicable Target
Formation(s) set forth on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-2_ for such Well Location), unto
Buyer against every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same
or any part thereof by, through or under Seller or its Affiliates, but not
otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except with respect to any liability of Seller for any claim
asserted in writing by Buyer to Seller in accordance with _Section_ __ _
11.1(c)_ on or before the expiration of the Survival Period for breach of such
special warranty, such special warranty shall cease and terminate at the end

(c) _Recovery on Special Warranty_.

 

(i) _Buyer_ __ _s Assertion of Title_ __ _ Warranty Breaches_. Prior
to the expiration of the period of time commencing as of the Closing Date and

requirement to deliver by the Defect Claim Date)

 



61

    

 setting forth any matters which Buyer intends to assert as a breach of
Sellers special warranty in the Assignment. For all purposes of this
Agreement, except with respect to Sellers indemnity obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 13.2(a)_ (but only with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 4.3_, _4.4_ , _4.7_ , _4.9_ , _4.11_
, _4.15_ and  _4.16_ , and the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to

be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no further liability for, any
breach of Sellers special warranty that Buyer fails to assert by a Title

defect giving rise to such breach of Sellers special warranty of title as a
Title Defect prior to the Defect Claim Date pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2_,
except that the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible shall not apply. Seller shall be entitled to offset any amount owed
by Seller for breach of the special warranty of title contained in the
Assignment with respect to any Well or Well Location by the amount of any
Title Benefits with respect to such Well or Well Location as to which Seller
gives Buyer notice after the Defect Claim Date which have not already been

 _11.2_ _Notice of Title Defects_ ; _Defect Adjustments_.

Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any matters which, in Buyers reasonable
opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as Title
Defects pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_. For all purposes of this
Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (except for the
special warranty of title contained in the Assignment and with respect to
Sellers indemnity obligations under _Section_ __ _ 13.2(a)_ (but only with
respect to the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.4_ ,
_4.7_ , _4.9_ , _4.11_ , _4.15_ and _4.16_ , and the certificate delivered at
Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(m)_ with respect to such
representations and warranties), and _Section_ __ _ 13.2(b)_ through
_Section_ __ _ 13.2(d)_, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller
shall have no Liability for, any Title Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a
Title Defect by a properly

Claim Date. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing, and
shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Well
(including the legal description of such Well), the Well Location (including
the legal description of such Well Location, the affected Lease(s)
contributing to such Well Location, and the affected Target Formation(s) with
respect to such Well Location), or portion thereof, affected by such Title
Defect (each a " _Title Defect Property_ "), (ii) the Allocated Value of each
Title Defect Property, (iii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Seller to verify the existence of such alleged Title Defect, and (iv) the
amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title

any claims that would be claims under the special warranty set forth in the
Assignment if asserted after Closing) discovered by Buyer during the preceding
calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to the Defect Claim Date; _provided_ that the failure to give such
notice shall not preclude Buyer from asserting a Title Defect on or before the
Defect Claim Date or asserting a breach of Sellers special warranty of title
after the Closing Date.

the obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Defect Claim Date with
respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a " _Title_ __ _ Benefit Notice_")
including (i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit and the Well
(including the legal description of such Well), or the Well Location
(including the legal description of such Well Location, the affected Lease(s)
contributing to such Well Location, and the affected Target Formation(s) with
respect to such Well Location), or portion thereof, affected by such alleged
Title Benefit (each a " _Title_ __ _ Benefit Property_"), and (ii) the amount
by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit
Property is increased by such alleged Title Benefit and the computations upon
which Sellers belief is based. Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
11.1(c)(ii)_, Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits for
which a Title Benefit Notice has not been delivered on or before the Defect
Claim Date.

 

(c) _Seller_ __ _s Right to Cure_.

 

(i) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure, at any time prior to ninety (90) days after Closing (the
" _Cure Period_ "), any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer
and which it has provided written notice of election to cure at least two (2)
Business Days prior to Closing. In the event that Seller elects to cure any
such Title Defect during the Cure Period, (A) the Title Defect Property
affected by such Title Defect shall be excluded from the transaction and (B)
the Purchase Price payable by Buyer to Seller shall be reduced at Closing by
the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property. Within ten (10) days after
the end of the Cure Period (or, if applicable, within ten (10) days following
the resolution of any dispute related to such Title Defect pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_), and subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.2(i)_, (1) if the
remedy set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.2(d)(i)_ is elected, Seller
shall assign to Buyer the affected

 



63

    

 Title Defect Property pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same
form as the Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property minus the Title Defect Amount
in respect of any portion of such Title Defect that is not cured as determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2(g)_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_, as
applicable ( _provided_  that solely in the case where such Title Defect
Amount (x) is determined under _Section_ __ _ 11.2(g)(ii)_ and (y) exceeds
the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, then Seller shall pay to
Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in writing by Buyer, an amount equal to such excess over such
Allocated Value), (2) if the remedy set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.2(d)(ii)_
is elected, Seller shall assign to Buyer the affected Title Defect Property
pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment,
and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such
Title Defect Property, and (3) if the remedy set forth in _Section_ __ _
11.2(d)(iii)_ is elected, Seller shall retain the affected Title Defect
Property and such Title Defect Property shall be deemed an Excluded Asset for
all purposes hereunder. Until such time as such Title Defect Property is
assigned to Buyer pursuant to _clauses_ __ _ (1)_ or _(2)_ above or retained
by Seller pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (3)_ above, Seller shall continue to
comply with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ with respect to such Title
Defect Property.

(ii) During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of the Cure
Period, Buyer agrees to afford Seller and its officers, employees and other
authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
the Assets and all Records in Buyers or any of its Affiliates possession or
control, together with a right to copy such Records at Sellers sole cost, in
order to facilitate Sellers attempt to cure any such Title Defects. An
election by Seller to attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without
prejudice to its rights under _Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_ and shall not
constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Sellers right to
dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Title
Defect.

(d) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing right to
(x) attempt to cure any Title Defect for which it has elected to cure in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.2(c)_ and (y) dispute the existence of a
Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto,
and subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14.1(d)_,
in the event that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on
or before Closing or the end of the Cure Period (as applicable), then, subject
to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible, upon
the election of Seller, at its sole option (subject to Buyers consent where
applicable below):

 

(i) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Title Defect Amount
determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(g)_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_;

 

(ii) subject to Buyers consent (in its sole discretion), Seller shall
indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such Title Defect with
respect to such Title Defect Property pursuant to an indemnity agreement in a
form and substance mutually agreed upon by the Parties (a " _Title Indemnity
Agreement_ "); or

 



64

    

(iii) in the event the Title Defect Amount of any Title Defect equals or
exceeds the Allocated Value of the applicable Title Defect Property, Seller
shall retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such
Title Defect, together with all associated Assets (in which case, such Assets
shall become Excluded Assets hereunder), in which event the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property and such associated Assets.

 

(e) _Remedies for Title_ __ _ Benefits_. With respect to each Title
Benefit Property reported under _Section_ __ _ 11.2_, as Sellers sole
remedy, the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects shall be
reduced by an amount (the " _Title_ __ _ Benefit Amount_") equal to the
increase in the Allocated Value for such Title Benefit Property caused by such
Title Benefit, as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2(h)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_.

(f) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for (i) Buyers rights under Sellers
special warranty of title in the Assignment and (ii) Buyers rights to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14.1(d)_, the provisions
set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(d)_ shall be the exclusive right and
remedy of Buyer with respect to Sellers failure to have Defensible Title with
respect to any Asset or any other title matter, and Buyer hereby waives any
and all other rights or remedies against Seller or its Affiliates with
respect thereto.

(g) _Title Defect Amount_. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a
Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title
Defect shall be the " _Title Defect Amount_ " for such Title Defect Property
and shall be determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions
(without duplication):

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and
liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount
necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect
Property;

 

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_ or 
_Exhibit_ __ _ B-2_, as applicable, and there is a proportionate decrease in
Sellers Working Interest for such Title Defect Property, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net
Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property on  _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_ or
_Exhibit_ __ _ B-2_, as applicable;

 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, Encumbrance upon or
other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described
above, then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account
the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title
Defect Property affected 

 



65

    

 by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential
economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect
Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller and
such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

 

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article_ __ _ XI_,
except for defects of the type described in _Section_ __ _ 11.2(g)(ii)_, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

(h) _Title_ __ _ Benefit Amount_. The Title Benefit Amount resulting
from a Title Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following
methodology, terms and conditions (without duplication):

 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers
Net Revenue Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_
or  _Exhibit_ __ _ B-2_, as applicable, and there is a proportionate
increase in Sellers Working Interest for such Title Defect Property, then the
Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such
Title Benefit Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property on _Exhibit_ __ _ B-1_ or
_Exhibit_ __ _ B-2_, as applicable; and

 

(iii) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated
Value of Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property
affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the
potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title
Benefit Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

 

(i) _Title Defect Threshold and Deductible_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Title
Defect affecting one or more Assets for which the Title Defect Amounts do not
exceed $50,000 (the " _Individual Title Defect Threshold_ "); and (ii) in no
event shall there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for any Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount
exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold unless (A) the amount of the
sum of (1) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that
exceed the Individual Title

 



66

    

 Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to
Title Defects cured by Seller), plus (2) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of
all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold
(but excluding any Environmental Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (B) the
Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments
to the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available hereunder, but
only to the extent that the amount by which the aggregate amount of such Title
Defect Amounts and Remediation Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible. For
the avoidance of doubt, if Seller indemnifies Buyer with respect to any Title
Defect Property pursuant to a Title Indemnity Agreement or any Environmental
Defect Property pursuant to an Environmental Indemnity Agreement, as
applicable, or retains any Title Defect Property pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
11.2(d)(iii)_ or Environmental Defect Property pursuant to _Section_ __ _
12.1(c)(ii)_, in each case, the Title Defect Amount or Remediation Amount, as
applicable, related to such Title Defect Property or Environmental Defect
Property will not be counted towards the Aggregate Deductible.

 

(j) _Title_ __ _ Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to
agree on matters regarding (x) all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title
Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts, and (y) the adequacy of any curative
efforts or materials provided by Seller to cure an alleged Title Defect
(the " _Disputed Title_ __ _ Matters_") prior to February 20, 2019 (the "
_Defect Arbitration Date_ "). If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by the
Defect Arbitration Date (or by the end of the Cure Period if Seller elects to
attempt to cure a Title Defect after Closing), the Disputed Title Matters
shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.2(j)_.

 

(i) If any Disputed Title Matter involving a Title Defect exists as of the
Closing and if Seller does not elect to cure any Title Defect that is the
subject of such dispute during the Cure Period, then (A) the Title Defect
Property affected by such Disputed Title Matter shall be excluded from the
transaction and (B) the Purchase Price payable to Seller shall be reduced at
Closing by the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property. If the Parties
are unable to agree on any Title Benefits and/or Title Benefit Amounts by the
Closing, the affected Title Benefit Property shall be conveyed to Buyer and
the Purchase Price payable to Seller at Closing shall not be adjusted by the
Title Benefit Amounts in dispute.

 

(ii) There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with
at least fifteen (15) years experience in oil and gas titles involving
properties in the regional area in which the Title Defect Properties or the
Title Benefit Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer
and Seller (x) at least five (5) days before the Defect Arbitration Date or
(y) within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Cure Period, as applicable,
or, absent such agreement, by the Denver, Colorado office of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _Title Arbitrator_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that such Title Arbitrator must (A) have not been employed by or represented
either Party (or its Affiliate) in the past ten (10) years, and (B) have
no ethical conflict in serving as the Title Arbitrator.

 



67

    

(iii) Each of Buyer and Seller shall submit to the Title Arbitrator its
proposed resolution of the Disputed Title Matter on or before the Defect
Arbitration Date or promptly after the fifteenth day following the end of the
Cure Period, as applicable. The proposed resolution of the Disputed Title
Matter shall include the best offer of the submitting Party in a single
monetary amount that such Party is willing to pay or accept (as applicable) to
settle the Disputed Title Matter. The Title Arbitrator shall be limited
to awarding only one or the other of the two proposed settlement amounts. The
arbitration proceeding shall be held in Denver, Colorado and shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this _Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_. The Title Arbitrators determination
shall be made within twenty (20) days after submission of the Disputed Title
Matters and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of
appeal. In making his determination with respect to any Disputed Title Matter,
the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in  _Section_ __ _
11.2(g)_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.2(h)_ and, subject to the foregoing, may
consider such other matters as, in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator, are
necessary to make a proper determination. The Title Arbitrator, however, may
not award Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount
claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect Notice. The Title Arbitrator
shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific
Disputed Title Matter submitted by either Party and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Each Party
shall bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case to the
Title Arbitrator. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs
and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.

 

(iv) To the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to
any Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ or
_Section_ __ _ 3.6(a)_ (for the avoidance of doubt, regardless of whether or
not the Final Settlement Statement has been agreed to or otherwise determined
as of such date), then, within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator
delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a
Title Defect Amount or a Title Benefit Amount, and, subject to _Section_ __ _
11.2(i)_, (A) with respect to a Title Defect, (1) if the remedy set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 11.2(d)(i)_ is elected, Seller shall assign to Buyer
the affected Title Defect Property excluded at Closing pursuant to an
instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment, and Buyer shall
pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in writing by Seller, an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property minus the Title Defect Amount attributable to any
portion of the Title Defect that was not cured or that was determined by the
Title Arbitrator pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_ to be owed to
Buyer ( _provided_ that solely in the case where such Title Defect Amount (x)
is determined under _Section_ __ _ 11.2(g)(ii)_ and (y) exceeds the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by
Buyer, an amount equal to such excess over such Allocated Value), (2) if the
remedy set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.2(d)(ii)_ is elected, Seller shall
assign to Buyer the affected Title

 



68

    

 Defect Property pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as
the Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified in writing by Seller, an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property, and (3) if the
remedy set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.2(d)(iii)_ is elected, Seller shall
retain the affected Title Defect Property and such Title Defect Property
shall be deemed an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder, and (B) with
respect to a Title Benefit, any amount due to Seller as a result of the
operation of such Title Benefit to offset Title Defect Amounts, if any, shall
be paid by Buyer to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account specified in writing by Seller. Until such time as such Title
Defect Property is assigned to Buyer pursuant to  _clauses_ __ _ (A)(1)_ or
_(A)(2)_ above or retained by Seller pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (A)(3)_
above, Seller shall continue to comply with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.1_
with respect to such Title Defect Property.

(v) Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account
of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_. To the
extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted at Closing pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.2(j)_ and subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, will be
made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ or this _Section_ __ _ 11.2(j)_.

 

 _11.3_ _Casualty and Condemnation Loss_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well)
and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and tear, in
each case, with respect to the Assets, and Buyer shall not assert such matters
as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder.

 

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion
of the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken
in condemnation or under right of eminent domain and the reduction in value
attributable to such individual casualty or taking exceeds $100,000 (each, a "
_Casualty Loss_ ") (with the risk of casualty or takings below such threshold
belonging to Buyer), and the Closing thereafter occurs, Seller shall elect by
written notice to Buyer prior to Closing either to (i) cause the Assets
affected by such Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to at least its
condition prior to such Casualty Loss, at Sellers sole cost, as promptly as
reasonably practicable but in no event later than the expiration of the
Transition Services Agreement; _provided_ that the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 10.1(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.1(f)_ shall apply to any such post-Closing
access by Seller and its respective officers, employees and other authorized
representatives as they do to Buyer and the Buyers Representatives access
prior to Closing. or (ii) pay to Buyer all sums actually paid to Seller by
Third Parties by reason of such Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the
Assets and assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all
of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid
awards and other rights against Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities,
other than insurance claims, of or against any Seller Indemnified Parties)
arising out of such Casualty Loss insofar as with

 



69

    

 respect to the Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , (A) Buyer shall purchase the
affected Assets at Closing notwithstanding such Casualty Loss and (B) Seller
shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all right, title,
interest and claims against Third Parties for the recovery of Sellers costs
and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in repairing such Casualty Loss
and/or pursuing or asserting any such insurance claims or other rights
against Third Parties. If Seller elects the option in item (i) above and to
the extent such repair and/or restoration is completed by Seller, Seller shall
retain all rights to insurance, condemnation awards and other claims against
Third Parties with respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the
Parties otherwise agree in writing.

 

 _11.4_ _Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign_.

 

(a) With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right set forth in 
_Schedule_ __ _ 4.10_, Seller, prior to Closing, shall send to the holder of
each such Preferential Purchase Right a notice in material compliance with the
contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right.

 

(i) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right
notifies Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Asset to
which its Preferential Purchase Right applies, then the Asset subject to such
Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned
to Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent of the portion of such Asset
affected by the Preferential Purchase Right), and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded.
Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any Person exercising a
Preferential Purchase Right prior to Closing. If such holder of such
Preferential Purchase Right thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the
Asset (or portion thereof) covered by such Preferential Purchase Right on or
before the end of the period of time for closing such sale but not later than
one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, (A) Seller shall so
notify Buyer, (B) Buyer shall purchase, on or before ten (10) days following
receipt of such notice, such Asset (or portion thereof) that was so excluded
from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, under the terms of this
Agreement and for a price equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price was
reduced at Closing with respect to such excluded Asset (or portion thereof)
and (C) Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof) so
excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form
as the Assignment. If, as of Closing, the time for exercising a Preferential
Purchase Right has not expired and such Preferential Purchase Right has not
been exercised or waived, then the Asset subject to such Preferential Purchase
Right shall be included in the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and
Buyer shall be solely responsible for complying with the terms of such
Preferential Purchase Right and shall be entitled to the proceeds, if any,
associated with the exercise of such Preferential Purchase Right.

 

(ii) All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Purchase Right has
been waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable
Preferential Purchase Right has expired without exercise by the holder
thereof, in each case, prior to Closing, shall be sold to Buyer at Closing
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

 



70

    

(b) With respect to each Consent set forth in  _Schedule_ __ _ 4.4_,
Seller, prior to Closing, shall send to the holder of each such Consent a
notice in material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to
such Consent seeking such holders consent to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(i) If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent prior to Closing and the
failure to obtain or comply with such Consent would (1) cause the assignment
of the Assets affected thereby to Buyer to be void or voidable, (2) cause the
termination of a Lease or Contract under the express terms thereof or (3)
expressly result in the payment of any liquidated amounts pursuant to the
terms of such Lease or Contract (in either case, a " _Hard Consent_ "), or (B)
a Consent requested by Seller is denied in writing, then, in each case, the
Asset (or portion thereof) affected by such un-obtained Consent shall be
excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and as Buyers
exclusive remedy, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value
of such Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded. In the event that a Consent
(with respect to an Asset excluded pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.4(b)(i)_) that was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained within one
hundred eighty (180) days following Closing, then, within ten (10) days after
such Consent is obtained (x) Buyer shall purchase the Asset (or portion
thereof) that was so excluded as a result of such previously un-obtained
Consent and pay to Seller the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced
at Closing with respect to the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded and (y)
Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded at
Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the same form as the
Assignment. Until the first to occur of such time as Seller has assigned any
Asset (or portion thereof) excluded pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.4(b)(i)_ or the expiration of such one hundred eighty (180) day period,
Seller shall continue to comply with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ with
respect to such Asset (or portion thereof).

(ii) If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in  _Schedule_ __ _
4.4_ prior to Closing and such Consent is not a Hard Consent and (B) such
Consent requested by Seller is not denied in writing by the holder thereof,
then the Asset (or portion thereof) subject to such un-obtained Consent shall
nevertheless be assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing as part of the Assets,
without adjustment to the Purchase Price, and Buyer shall have no claim
against, and Seller shall have no Liability for, the failure to obtain such
Consent.

(iii) Prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents listed on _Schedule_ __ _ 4.4_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party shall be required to incur any
Liability or pay any money in order to obtain any such Consent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such restriction shall not be viewed to limit Buyers
obligation under _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ to post any credit support required to
be posted by the Buyer thereunder or the obligation of Buyer to post any
credit support required to be posted under the terms of any Material Contract
listed

 



71

    

 on _Schedule 4.8(a)_ in order for Buyer to meet any applicable
creditworthiness test or similar threshold contained therein. Subject to the
foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide Seller with any information or
documentation that may be reasonably requested by Seller and/or the Third
Party holder(s) of such Consents in order to facilitate the process of
obtaining such Consents.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 11.4(b)_ to the
contrary, the provisions of subparts (i) through (iii) of this _Section_ __ _
11.4(b)_ shall not apply to the Schedule 6.18 Assets covered by the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 6.18_, with respect to which the provisions of  _Section_
__ _ 6.18_, the Hydrocarbon Production Assignment, and the Mortgage shall
govern and control.

 

ARTICLE XII

 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

 _12.1_ _Notice of Environmental Defects_.

 

(a) _Environmental Defects Notice_. Buyer must deliver no later than the
Defect Claim Date claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this
_Section_ __ _ 12.1(a)_ (collectively, the " _Environmental Defect Notices_ "
and, individually, an " _Environmental Defect Notice_ ") setting forth any
matters which, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects
and which Buyer intends to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 12.1_. To be effective, each Environmental Defect Notice
shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the matter
constituting the alleged Environmental Condition (including the applicable
Environmental Law violated or implicated thereby) and the Assets affected by
such alleged Environmental Condition (the " _Environmental Defect Property_
"), (ii) the Allocated Value of the Assets (or portions thereof) affected by
such alleged Environmental Condition, (iii) supporting documents reasonably
available to or prepared by Buyer reasonably necessary for Seller to verify
the existence of such alleged Environmental Condition, and (iv) a calculation
of the Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that
Buyer reasonably asserts is necessary to Remediate such alleged Environmental
Condition. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, any Environmental Defect asserted by
Buyer pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 12.1(a)_ shall be limited to the
Assets only, and Buyer shall not have the right to assert environmental
defects with respect to any other assets, properties or operations. For all
purposes of this Agreement (except with respect to Sellers indemnity
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 13.2(a)_ (but only with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.18_ and the
certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(m)_ with
respect to such representations and warranties), and Section 13.2(b) through
_Section_ __ _ 13.2(d)_, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller
shall have no liability for, (A) any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails
to assert as an Environmental Defect by a properly delivered Environmental
Defect Notice delivered to Seller on or before the Defect Claim Date, and/or
(B) any environmental defect affecting any assets, properties or operations
other than the Assets (other than contribution requirements in accordance with
the applicable operating agreements), in each case, with such Liabilities
being " _Buyer_ __ _s Environmental_

 



72

    

  _Liabilities_." Buyers calculation of the Remediation Amount included in
the Environmental Defect Notice must describe in reasonable detail the
Remediation proposed for the alleged Environmental Condition that gives rise
to the asserted Environmental Defect and identify all material assumptions
used by Buyer in calculating the Remediation Amount, including the standards
that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with Environmental Laws. To give
Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Environmental Defects,
Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of
each calendar week prior to the Defect Claim Date, written notice of all
alleged Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding
calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented
prior to the Defect Claim Date; ___provided_ that the failure to give
such notice shall not preclude Buyer from asserting an Environmental Defect
on or before the Defect Claim Date.

 

(b) _Seller_ __ _s Right to Cure_.

 

(i) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure, at any time prior to the expiration of the Cure Period,
any Environmental Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer and which it
has provided written notice of election to cure at least two (2) Business Days
prior to Closing. In the event that Seller elects to cure any such
Environmental Defect during the Cure Period, (A) the Environmental Defect
Property affected by such Environmental Defect shall be excluded from the
transaction, and (B) the Purchase Price payable by Buyer to Seller shall be
reduced at Closing by the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect
Property. Within ten (10) days after the end of the Cure Period (or, if
applicable, within ten (10) days following the resolution of any dispute
related to such Environmental Defect pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_),
and subject to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(e)_, (1) if the remedy set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)(i)_ is elected, Seller shall assign to Buyer the
affected Environmental Defect Property pursuant to an instrument in
substantially the same form as the Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller
an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property
minus the Remediation Amount in respect of any portion of such Environmental
Defect that is not cured, (2) if the remedy set forth in _Section_ __ _
12.1(c)(iii)_ is elected, Seller shall assign to Buyer the affected
Environmental Defect Property pursuant to an instrument in substantially the
same form as the Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to
the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property, and (3) if the
remedy set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)(ii)_ is elected, Seller shall
retain the affected Environmental Defect Property and such Environmental
Defect Property shall be deemed an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder.
Until such time as such Environmental Defect Property is assigned to Buyer
pursuant to _clauses_ __ _ (1)_ or _(2)_ above or retained by Seller
pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (3)_ above, Seller shall continue to comply with
the terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ with respect to such Environmental Defect
Property.

 

(ii) During the period of time from Closing to the expiration of the Cure
Period, Buyer agrees to afford Seller and its officers, employees and other
authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to
the Assets and all Records in Buyers or any of its Affiliates possession or
control in 

 



73

    

 order to facilitate Sellers attempt to cure any such Environmental Defects.
An election by Seller to attempt to cure an Environmental Defect shall be
without prejudice to its rights under  _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_ and shall not
constitute an admission against interest or a waiver of Sellers right to
dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged
Environmental Defect.

 

(c) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing
right to (x) attempt to cure any Environmental Defect for which it has
elected to cure in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.1(b)_ and (y) dispute
the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation Amount
asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14.1(d)_, in the event that any Environmental
Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.1(a)_ is
not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing or the end of
the Cure Period (as applicable), then, subject to the Individual Environmental
Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible, upon the election of Seller, at its
sole option (subject to Buyers consent or election where applicable below),
elect one of the following:

(i) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Remediation Amount agreed
upon by the Parties or determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_;

 

(ii) in the event the Remediation Amount of any Environmental Defect equals
or exceeds the Allocated Value of the applicable Environmental Defect
Property, Seller shall retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to
such Environmental Defect, together with all associated Assets (in which case,
such Assets shall become Excluded Assets hereunder), in which event the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Asset and such associated Assets; or

 

(iii) subject to Buyers consent (in its sole discretion), Seller shall
indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such Environmental
Defect with respect to the Assets pursuant to an indemnity agreement in a form
and substance mutually agreeable to the Parties (each, an " _Environmental
Indemnity Agreement_ ");

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Remediation Amount for such
Environmental Defect Property equals or exceeds the Allocated Value for such
Environmental Defect Property, either Party shall have the right to elect to
have the option set forth in _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)(ii)_ apply with respect
to such Environmental Defect Property.

 

If the option set forth in _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)(ii)_ applies, Buyer shall
be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs and expenses
attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental Condition attributable to
such Environmental Defect and for all Liabilities with respect thereto and
such responsibility of Buyer shall be deemed to constitute part of the
Assumed Obligations hereunder.

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for (i) Sellers representation contained
in _Section_ __ _ 4.18_ and the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(m)_,

 



74

    

 (ii) Sellers indemnity obligations under _Section_ __ _ 13.2(a)_ (but only
with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 4.18_ and the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3(m)_ with respect to such representations and warranties), and _Section_ __
_ 13.2(b)_ through  _Section_ __ _ 13.2(d)_, and (iii) Buyers rights to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 14.1(d)_, the provisions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)_ shall be the exclusive right and remedy
of Buyer with respect to any Environmental Defect with respect to any Asset or
any other environmental matter, and Buyer hereby waives any and all other
rights and remedies against Seller with respect thereto.

 

(e) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price
or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Environmental Defect
affecting one or more Assets for which the Remediation Amounts do not exceed
$100,000 (the " _Individual _ _Environmental Threshold_ "); and (ii) in no
event shall there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for any Environmental Defect for which the Remediation
Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold unless (A) the amount
of the sum of (1) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all such Environmental
Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any
Remediation Amounts attributable to any Environmental Defects cured by
Seller), plus (2) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that
exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect
Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (B) the
Aggregate Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments
to the Purchase Price or other applicable remedies available hereunder, but
only with respect to the amount by which the aggregate amount of such
Remediation Amounts and Title Defect Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible.
For the avoidance of doubt, if Seller indemnifies Buyer with respect to any
Title Defect Property pursuant to a Title Indemnity Agreement or
any Environmental Defect Property pursuant to an Environmental Indemnity
Agreement, as applicable, or retains any Title Defect Property pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.2(d)(iii)_ or Environmental Defect Property pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)(ii)_, in each case, the Title Defect Amount or
Remediation Amount, as applicable, related to such Title Defect Property or
Environmental Defect Property will not be counted towards the Aggregate
Deductible. 

(f) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to
agree on matters regarding (x) all Environmental Defects and Remediation
Amounts and (y) the adequacy of any cure by Seller of any asserted
Environmental Defect _(items_ __ _ (x)_ and _(y)_ , collectively, the "
_Disputed Environmental Matters_ ") prior to the Defect Arbitration Date. If
Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by the Defect Arbitration Date (or by the
end of the Cure Period if Seller elects to attempt to cure an asserted
Environmental Defect after Closing), the Disputed Environmental Matters shall
be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 12.1(f)_.

 

(i) If any Disputed Environmental Matter involving an Environmental Defect
exists as of the Closing and if Seller does not elect to cure any
Environmental Defect that is the subject of such dispute during the Cure
Period, then (A) the Environmental Defect Property affected by such Disputed
Environmental Matter shall be excluded from the transaction and (B) the
Purchase Price payable to Seller shall be reduced at Closing by the Allocated
Value of such Environmental Defect Property.

 



75

    

(ii) There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental
attorney with at least fifteen (15) years experience in environmental matters
involving oil and gas producing properties in the regional area in which the
affected Assets are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and
Seller (x) at least five (5) days before the Defect Arbitration Date or (y)
within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Cure Period, as applicable, or,
absent such agreement, by the Denver, Colorado office of the American
Arbitration Association (the " _Environmental Arbitrator_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Environmental Arbitrator must (A) have not been employed
by or represented either Party (or its Affiliate) in the past ten (10) years,
and (B) have no ethical conflict in serving as the Environmental Arbitrator.

 

(iii) Each of Buyer and Seller shall submit to the Environmental Arbitrator
its proposed resolution of the Disputed Environmental Matter on or before the
Defect Arbitration Date or promptly after the fifteenth day following the end
of the Cure Period, as applicable. The proposed resolution of the Disputed
Environmental Matter shall include the best offer of the submitting Party in
a single monetary amount that such Party is willing to pay or accept (as
applicable) to settle the Disputed Environmental Matter. The Environmental
Arbitrator shall be limited to awarding only one or the other of the two
proposed settlement amounts. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in
Denver, Colorado and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 12.1_. The
Environmental Arbitrators determination shall be made within twenty (20) days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon
both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the
Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 12.1_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other
matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or
helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however,
may not award Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount
claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The
Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific Disputed Environmental Matters submitted by either
Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with
respect to any matter. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case to the Environmental Arbitrator. Each of Seller
and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental
Arbitrator.

(iv) To the extent that the award of the Environmental Arbitrator with
respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ or _Section_ __ _
3.6(a)_ (for the avoidance of doubt, regardless of whether or not the Final
Settlement Statement has been agreed to or otherwise determined as of such
date), then, within ten (10) days after the

 



76

    

 Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his
award with respect to any Remediation Amount, and, subject to _Section_ __ _
12.1(e)_, (A) if the remedy set forth in _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)(i)_ is
elected, Seller shall assign to Buyer the affected Environmental Defect
Property excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in substantially the
same form as the Assignment, and Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by Seller,
an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property
minus the Remediation Amount attributable to any portion of the Environmental
Defect that was not cured or that was determined by the Environmental
Arbitrator pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_ to be owed to Buyer, (B)
if the remedy set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)(iii)_ is elected, Seller
shall assign to Buyer the affected Environmental Defect Property pursuant to
an instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment, and Buyer
shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified in writing by Seller, an amount equal to the Allocated Value
of such Environmental Defect Property, and (C) if the remedy set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 12.1(c)(ii)_ is elected, Seller shall retain the affected
Environmental Defect Property and such Environmental Defect Property shall be
deemed an Excluded Asset for all purposes hereunder. Until such time as such
Environmental Defect Property is assigned to Buyer pursuant to _clauses_ __ _
(A)_ or _(B)_ above or retained by Seller pursuant to _clause_ __ _ (C)_
above, Seller shall continue to comply with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.1_
with respect to such Environmental Defect Property.

 

(v) Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account
of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_. To
the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing,
the Purchase Price shall be adjusted at Closing pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 12.1(f)_ and subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, will be
made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ or this _Section_ __ _ 12.1(f)_.

 

 _12.2_ _NORM_ _,_ _Asbestos_ _,_ _Wastes and Other Substances_. Buyer
acknowledges that the Assets have been used for exploration, development and
production of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water,
wastes or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets or
associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may
contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach
itself to the inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale, or in other
forms. The wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets or included
in the Assets may contain NORM, asbestos and other wastes or Hazardous
Substances. NORM containing material and/or other wastes or Hazardous
Substances may have come in contact with various environmental media,
including water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may be required for the
assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of environmental
media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances from the Assets.
The presence of NORM or asbestos-containing materials that are non-friable
cannot be claimed as an Environmental Defect, except to the extent
constituting a violation of Environmental Laws.

_Section_ __ _ 13.3_, _Section_ __ _ 15.17_ and _Section_ __ _ 15.19(c)_
shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

(a) For purposes of _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, _Section_ __ _ 6.10(d)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 6.13_, _Section_ __ _ 6.18(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, this
_Article_ __ _ XIII_, _Section_ __ _ 15.17_ or  _Section_ __ _ 15.19(c)_,
the term " _Indemnifying Party_ " when used in connection with particular

XIII_, _Section_ __ _ 15.17_ or _Section_ __ _ 15.19(c)_, and the term "

shall mean the Party and/or other Persons having the right to be indemnified
with respect to such Liabilities by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.18(b)_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.1_, this _Article_ __ _ XIII_, _Section_ __ _ 15.17_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 15.19(c)_.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,

shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of its claim under this 
_Section_ __ _ 13.7_, including the specific details of and specific basis

provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if

insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to
effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or otherwise materially
prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend against the Third
Party Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an
inaccuracy or a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that was inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its
receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits

such Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such thirty
(30) day period, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion,
answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its obligation to defend and
indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the
right and obligation to diligently defend and indemnify, at its sole cost and
expense, the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) (A) have
control of the defense and proceedings, excluding any compromise or
settlement of, any Unscheduled Pre-Closing Litigation matters, (B) be required
to consult with Seller regarding such matter(s) and consider in good faith
any suggestions made by Seller with respect thereto and (C) be required to
receive the consent of Seller to any compromise or settlement thereof and (ii)
have full control of the defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement of, any Part 1 Litigation. Additionally, in respect of any matters
described in subpart (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 13.7(d)_, Seller shall have
the right to participate in the defense of, and other proceedings with
respect to, such matter(s) with counsel of its own choosing at its own cost
and expense. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying
Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not
control, at its own expense, any defense or settlement of any Third Party
Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
13.7(d)_. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (x) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto which does not include an unconditional written
release of the Indemnified Party from all Liability in respect of such Third
Party Claim or (y) settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely
affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered
by the indemnity).

 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third
Party Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or settle
such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend against the Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Partys choosing, subject
to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its obligation and assume the
defense of the Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final
determination thereof. If settlement has been offered and the Indemnifying
Party has not yet admitted its obligation to defend and indemnify the
Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and
the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten (10) days following
receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party from and against the liability and consent to such
settlement, (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable
judgment, the proposed settlement, or (iii) deny liability. Any failure by the
Indemnifying Party to respond to such notice shall be deemed to be an
election under subsection (iii) above.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its
receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii)
admit its liability for such Liability or

 



82

    

 (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities. If the Indemnifying Party does
not notify the Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period that it
has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for such Liabilities,
the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have disputed the claim for such
Liabilities.

_Article_ __ _ VII_ (other than those actions or deliveries to occur at
Closing or contingent upon the satisfaction of other conditions precedent set

Closing; and (D) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are
funded, then it would use reasonable best efforts to take all actions that are
within its control to cause the Closing to occur, then, in such event, Seller

option, in lieu of terminating this Agreement, seek specific performance by
Buyer of this Agreement;

 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, (A) nothing herein shall be construed to
prohibit Seller from first seeking specific performance, but thereafter
terminating this Agreement and (B) while Seller may pursue (y) the right to
reimbursement and indemnity set forth in subpart (i) or (ii) above or (z) the
grant of specific performance as provided in subpart (iii) above, in no event
shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive more than one of the remedies
described in the immediately foregoing subparts (i) or (ii), on one hand, or
subpart (iii), on the other hand; and

 



86

    

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 14.2(b)_ to the
contrary, in the event that this Agreement is terminated in a manner that

Sellers rights as a third party beneficiary under any Equity Commitment

(c) If Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 14.1(c)_, where the following conditions are satisfied (i) all
of the conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller set forth in

its option, (A) terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _

Agreement, seek specific performance by Seller of this Agreement. Nothing
herein shall be construed to prohibit Buyer from first seeking specific
performance, but thereafter terminating this Agreement.

(d) Each Party acknowledges that as express consideration for the Parties
entering into this Agreement and such Partys representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein, each Party covenants and agrees that (i) each
Party would be irreparably harmed by any breaches by the other Party of its

_15.2_ _Expenses and Taxes_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by Buyer, Buyer Parent or Seller in negotiating this
Agreement or in consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be paid by the Party incurring the same, including legal and accounting
fees, costs and expenses.

 

(b) Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (i)
any Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the portion of any
Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time. Buyer shall be
allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (x) any Tax period
beginning at or after the Effective Time and (y) the portion of any Straddle
Period beginning at the Effective Time.

 

(c) For purposes of determining the allocations described in _Section_ __ _
15.2(b)_, (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or
production of Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in _clause_
__ _ (iii)_, below) shall be allocated to the period in which the severance
or production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (ii) Asset Taxes that
are based upon or related to sales or receipts or imposed on a transactional
basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in _clause_ __ _ (i)_ or _(iii)_
), shall be allocated to the period in which the transaction giving rise to
such Asset Taxes occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem, property
or other Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle
Period shall be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period ending
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the portion of such Straddle
Period beginning at the Effective Time by prorating each such Asset Tax based
on the number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur before the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the number of
days in such Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, on the other hand. For purposes of clause (iii) of the
preceding sentence, the period for such Asset Taxes shall begin on the date on
which ownership of the applicable Assets gives rise to liability for the
particular Asset Tax and shall end on the day before the next such date.

(d) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the
time an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_, _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.6_, as
applicable, the Parties shall utilize the most recent information available
in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To
the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax (or the amount thereof paid or
economically borne by a Party) is ultimately determined to be different than
the amount (if any) that was taken into account in the Final Settlement
Statement as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6_, timely
payments will be made from one Party to the other to the extent necessary to
cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax that is allocable to
such Party under this _Section_ __ _ 15.2_.

 

(e) Subject to Buyers indemnification rights under _Section_ __ _ 13.2_,
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) prepare and file with the appropriate
Taxing Authority any

 



88

    

 and all Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect
to Asset Taxes, (ii) submit each such Tax Return that relates to a Straddle
Period or to a Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time to Seller for
its review and comment reasonably in advance of the due date therefor, and
(iii) timely file any such Tax Return, incorporating any reasonable comments
received from Seller (with respect to Tax Returns relating to a Straddle
Period or to a Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time) prior to the due
date therefor. Buyer shall pay the Asset Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns
and Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer the amount of any Seller Taxes paid
with respect to such Tax Returns. The Parties agree that (x) this _Section_ __
_ 15.2(e)_ is intended to solely address the timing and manner in which
certain Tax Returns relating to Asset Taxes are filed and the Asset Taxes
shown thereon are paid to the applicable Taxing Authority, and (y) nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 15.2(e)_ shall be interpreted as altering the manner in
which Asset Taxes are allocated to and economically borne by the Parties
(except for any penalties, interest or additions to Tax imposed as a result of
any breach by Buyer of its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 15.2(e)_,
which shall be borne by Buyer).

 

(f) All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments, conveyances or
other instruments required to convey title to the Assets to Buyer shall be
borne solely by Buyer. Any sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary,
registration or similar Taxes incurred or imposed with respect to the
transactions described in this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ")
shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller. Seller and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

 

(g) Seller shall be entitled to any and all refunds (which, for purposes of
this  _Section_ __ _ 15.2(g)_, shall include credits received in lieu of
refunds, if any) of Asset Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
15.2(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 15.2(c)_, and Buyer shall be entitled to any and
all refunds of Asset Taxes allocated to Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _
15.2(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 15.2(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Seller nor Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of Asset Taxes allocated to
it pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 15.2(b)_ if Seller or Buyer, as the case may
be, did not pay or otherwise economically bear such Asset Taxes. If a Party or
its Affiliate receives a refund of Asset Taxes to which the other Party is
entitled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 15.2(g)_, such recipient Party shall
forward to the entitled Party the amount of such refund within thirty (30)
days after such refund is received, net of any reasonable, out-of-pocket
costs or expenses incurred by such recipient Party in procuring such refund.

 

(h) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating
to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other Partys request) the provision of records and information that are
relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under
this Agreement. The Parties agree to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to any Tax period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the 

 



89

    

 statute of limitations of the respective Tax periods and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority.
Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Buyer
becomes entitled, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_, to any amounts earned
from the sale of Hydrocarbons, which amounts are received after the eighteen
(18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall be allocated and bear
all Asset Taxes attributable to the production of such Hydrocarbons or the
receipt of proceeds therefrom notwithstanding that such Hydrocarbons were
produced prior to the Effective Time.

 

(j) To the extent Buyer is required by Law to deduct or withhold any amount
for or on account of any Taxes from the payments otherwise due hereunder,
Buyer shall make such deductions or withholdings and pay the amount so
deducted or withheld to the appropriate Governmental Authority; _provided_ ,
_however_ , Buyer shall provide at least ten (10) Business Days written
notice to Seller if Buyer intends to withhold any such amounts and the Parties
shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any such deduction or withholding, including by
providing any certificates or forms that are reasonably requested to establish
an exemption from (or reduction in) any deduction or withholding. Upon making
such payments to the appropriate Governmental Authority, Buyer shall be
treated as having paid the amounts deducted or withheld as otherwise required
hereunder.

 

 _15.3_ _Assignment_ _._ Subject to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _
15.17_, this Agreement may not be assigned by Buyer, Buyer Parent or Seller
without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any assignment or
delegation made without the consents required hereby shall be void. In the
event a Party consents to any such assignment, such assignment shall not
relieve the assigning Party of any obligations and responsibilities hereunder,
including obligations and responsibilities arising following such assignment.
Any assignment or other transfer by Buyer, Buyer Parent or their respective
successors and assigns of any of the Assets shall not relieve Buyer, Buyer
Parent or their respective successors or assigns of any of their obligations
(including indemnity obligations) hereunder, as to the Assets so assigned or
transferred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Buyer remaining
liable for their respective obligations (including indemnity obligations)
hereunder, Buyer may direct that the Assets be assigned to one or more of the
other members of the Buyer Group; _provided_ that such applicable members of
the Buyer Group expressly agree, pursuant to an instrument in favor of and
reasonably acceptable to Seller and without releasing Buyer hereunder, to
assume and be directly responsible for all of Buyers obligations hereunder as
to the Assets so assigned.

 

 _15.4_ _Preparation of Agreement_. Both Seller and Buyer and their
respective counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the
event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on
the identity of the draftsman of this Agreement.

 



90

    

_15.5_ _Publicity_. Seller, Buyer and Buyer Parent shall promptly
consult with one another with regard to all press releases or other public or
private announcements issued or made at or prior to Closing concerning this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, and, except as may
be required by applicable Laws or the applicable rules and regulations of any
Governmental Authority or stock exchange, neither Buyer nor Seller shall issue
any such press release or other public or private announcement without the
prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The Parties shall be obligated to hold all specific terms
and provisions of this Agreement strictly confidential after the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not (a) restrict
disclosures by Buyer, Buyer Parent or Seller that are required by applicable
securities or other Laws or regulations or the applicable rules of any stock

AGREEMENT, AND NEITHER SELLER NOR BUYER SHALL BE BOUND BY OR LIABLE FOR ANY
ALLEGED REPRESENTATION, PROMISE, INDUCEMENT OR STATEMENTS OF INTENTION NOT SO
SET FORTH. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN (A) THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF

GOVERN AND CONTROL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF THE

93

    

_15.10_ _Parties in Interest_. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Seller and Buyer
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other
than the Parties or their respective successors and permitted assigns, or the
Parties respective related Indemnified Parties hereunder any rights,
remedies, obligations or Liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement;
_provided_ that only a Party and its successors and permitted assigns will
have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its own behalf
or on behalf of any of its related Indemnified Parties (but shall not be
obligated to do so). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Sources
shall be deemed Third Party beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 15.10_,  _Section_ __ _ 15.11_, _Section_ __ _ 15.12_,
_Section_ __ _ 15.13_ and _Section_ __ _ 15.20_, each of which shall be
enforceable by each Financing Source.

 

 _15.11_ _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified only by an instrument in writing executed
by both Parties and expressly identified as an amendment, restatement,
supplement or modification; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, (a) the provisions relating to the
Financing Sources set forth in _Section_ __ _ 15.10_, this _Section_ __ _
15.11_, _Section_ __ _ 15.12_, _Section_ __ _ 15.13_ and  _Section_ __ _
15.20_ (including defined terms, that would modify the substance of such
Sections) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified or
altered in any manner that is material and adverse to the interests of the
Financing Sources or their respective Affiliates without the prior written
consent of the Financing Sources and (b) no amendment shall be made which by
Law would require the further approval by the stockholders of Buyer Parent
without first obtaining such further approval.

_15.12_ _Waiver_ ; _Rights Cumulative_. Any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a
written instrument executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving compliance.
No course of dealing on the part of either Party or its officers, employees,
agents, or representatives, and no failure by either Party to exercise any of
its rights under this Agreement, shall, in any such case, operate as a waiver
thereof or affect in any way the right of such Party at a later time to
enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver by either Party of any
condition, or any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to
be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or
breach or a waiver of any other condition or of any breach of any other term,
covenant, representation or warranty. The rights of Seller and Buyer under
this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise or partial exercise of
any such right shall not preclude the exercise of any other right.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions
relating to the Financing Sources set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 15.10_,
_Section_ __ _ 15.11_, this _Section_ __ _ 15.12_, _Section_ __ _ 15.13_,
and _Section_ __ _ 15.20_ (including defined terms that would modify the
substance of such Sections) may not be waived in a manner that is material and
adverse to the interests of the Financing Sources or their respective
Affiliates without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 

 _15.13_ _Governing Law_ ; _Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the
rights, duties and

 



94

    

 relationship of the parties hereto and thereto, shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Texas,
excluding any conflicts of law, rule or principle that might refer
construction of provisions to the Laws of another jurisdiction.

(b) The Parties agree that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient forum
for any disputes between the Parties arising out of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in any
state or federal court in Dallas, Texas, and each of the Parties irrevocably
submits to the jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of any proceeding
arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties further agree that
the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any disputes arising out of
this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby in any court or jurisdiction other than the above specified courts. The
Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that a final and
nonappealable judgment against a Party in any action or proceeding
contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a
certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of such judgment.

 

(c) To the extent that either Party or any of its Affiliates has acquired,
or hereafter may acquire, any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from
any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect
to itself or its property, such Party (on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates) hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in  _Section_ __ _ 15.13(b)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 15.13_ or otherwise
in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties agrees that it will not
bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or Third
Party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction
is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), and any such
action, claim, cross-claim or Third Party claim shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York,
excluding any conflicts of law, rule or principle that might refer
construction of provisions to the Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

(e) THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 



95

    

_15.14_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to either Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

 

 _15.15_ _Removal of Name_. As promptly as practicable, but in any case
within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate, or
cause to be eliminated, the names " _QEP_ ", " _QEP Energy_ " and any
variations thereof from the Assets and, except with respect to such
grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use any
logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

 _15.16_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a Party by facsimile
or other electronic transmission shall be deemed an original signature
hereto.

_15.17_ _Like-Kind Exchange_. Buyer and Seller agree that either or both
of Seller and Buyer may elect to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets
as an exchange of like-kind property under Section 1031 of the Code (an "
_Exchange_ "); _provided_ that the Closing shall not be delayed by reason of
the Exchange. Each Party agrees to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the other Party in the completion of such an Exchange including an Exchange
subject to the procedures outlined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1
and/or Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37. Each of Seller and
Buyer shall have the right at any time prior to Closing to assign all or a
part of its rights under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary (as that
term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an
exchange accommodation titleholder (as that term is defined in Internal
Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37) to effect an Exchange. Each Party
acknowledges and agrees that neither an assignment of a Partys rights under
this Agreement nor any other actions taken by a Party or any other Person in
connection with the Exchange shall release either Party from, or modify, any
of its liabilities and obligations (including indemnity obligations to each
other) under this Agreement, and neither Party makes any representations as
to any particular tax treatment that may be afforded to the other Party by
reason of such assignment or any other actions taken in connection with the
Exchange. The Party electing to treat the acquisition or sale of the Assets
as an Exchange shall be obligated to pay all additional costs incurred
hereunder as a result of the Exchange, and in consideration for the
cooperation of the other Party, the Party electing Exchange treatment shall
agree to pay all costs associated with the Exchange and to indemnify and hold
the other Party, its Affiliates, and their respective former, current and
future partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
Liabilities arising out of, based upon, attributable to or resulting from the
Exchange or transactions or actions taken in connection with the Exchange that
would not have been incurred by the other Party but for the electing Partys
Exchange election.

 



96

    

_15.18_ _Specific Performance_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 14.2_, the
Parties agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed by a Party in accordance with their specific terms, the other Party
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to
any other remedy available at law or in equity.

_15.19_ _Post-Closing Financial_ _Cooperation_.

the extent such information is available, and personnel of Seller and its
Affiliates and its accounting firms and/or counsel as Buyer or Buyer Parent
may reasonably request to enable Buyer or Buyer Parent and their respective
representatives to prepare and obtain the Additional Financial Statements.
Commencing on the date hereof and for only up to one (1) year after the

such information other than in connection with the preparation of any such
filings, _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Buyer and Buyer Parent may
disclose the information (x) to any representative of Buyer or Buyer Parent
but only to the extent such representative needs to know such information for
Buyer or Buyer Parents purpose of preparing the Additional Financial
Statement; _provided_ that (1) Buyer or Buyer Parent shall advise each such
representative of the confidential nature of the information, (2) Buyer or
Buyer Parent shall be responsible for each such respective representatives
compliance with the terms of this Agreement binding on Buyer, and (3) Buyer
and Buyer Parent shall take reasonable measures to cause its representatives
to comply with the terms of this Agreement binding on Buyer and Buyer Parent;
or (y) to the extent that Buyer, Buyer Parent or such respective
representative is required to disclose such information in order to avoid
committing a violation of any Law, or governmental rule or regulation,
including any rules or regulations of any securities association, stock
exchange or national securities quotation system, _provided_ that Buyer or
Buyer Parent provides prompt advance written notice to Seller of the proposed
disclosure.

 



98

    

(e) Except for the information that will be contained in the
representation letters referred to above, all of the information to be

claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder, under the Transaction
Documents, or otherwise in connection with the Financing or the transactions
