another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an &#147;Indemnitee&#148;), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or
omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in,
or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to,
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. </P>

threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or
officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture,

paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to
be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made under this Section&nbsp;2 in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper. </P>

Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article EIGHTH, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action,
suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or
proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i)&nbsp;the disposition being adverse to Indemnitee, (ii)&nbsp;an adjudication that Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii)&nbsp;a
plea of guilty or nolo contendere by Indemnitee, (iv)&nbsp;an adjudication that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v)&nbsp;with
respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto. </P>

the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the
Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to </P>

participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to
Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than
as provided below in this Section&nbsp;4. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the
Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of Indemnitee unless (i)&nbsp;the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii)&nbsp;counsel to Indemnitee shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation or (iii)&nbsp;the Corporation shall not in
fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly
provided by this Article EIGHTH. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have reasonably
made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii)&nbsp;above. The Corporation shall not be required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Article EIGHTH for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation effected without
its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee&#146;s written consent. Neither the Corporation nor
Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any proposed settlement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">5. Advance of Expenses. Subject to the provisions
of Section&nbsp;6 of this Article EIGHTH, in the event of any threatened or pending action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Article EIGHTH, any expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) incurred
by or on behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the payment of such expenses
incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be
determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article EIGHTH. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make such repayment. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">6. Procedure for Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to
Section&nbsp;1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article EIGHTH, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the
written request of Indemnitee, unless the Corporation has assumed the defense pursuant to Section&nbsp;4 of this Article EIGHTH (and none of the circumstances described in Section&nbsp;4 of this Article EIGHTH that would nonetheless entitle the
Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and expenses of separate counsel have occurred). Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with respect to requests under Section&nbsp;1 or 2 only as authorized in the specific case
upon a determination by the Corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;1 or 2, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each
instance (a)&nbsp;by a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (&#147;disinterested directors&#148;), whether or not a quorum, (b)&nbsp;by
a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c)&nbsp;if there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who
may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d)&nbsp;by the stockholders of the Corporation. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">7. Remedies. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted by this Article EIGHTH shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in
any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard
of conduct, nor an actual determination by the </P>

Corporation pursuant to Section&nbsp;6 of this Article EIGHTH that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that
Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
Corporation shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article EIGHTH. Indemnitee&#146;s expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) reasonably incurred in
connection with successfully establishing Indemnitee&#146;s right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any suit brought by Indemnitee to
enforce a right to indemnification hereunder it shall be a defense that the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">8. Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article EIGHTH, except as set forth in Section&nbsp;7 of this Article EIGHTH,
the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article EIGHTH in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article EIGHTH, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification
payments to an Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund indemnification payments to the Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">9. Subsequent Amendment. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article EIGHTH or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall adversely affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising
out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">10. Other Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article EIGHTH shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in Indemnitee&#146;s
official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and
administrators of Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article EIGHTH shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures
different from those set forth in this Article EIGHTH. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other
persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article EIGHTH. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">11. Partial Indemnification. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Article EIGHTH to indemnification by the Corporation for
some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) or amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee
for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) or amounts paid in settlement to which
Indemnitee is entitled. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">12. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him or her in any such
capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would </P>

then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974) and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by
any applicable portion of this Article EIGHTH that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. </P>
