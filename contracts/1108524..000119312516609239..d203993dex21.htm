RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Purchaser will make a cash tender offer (as it may be extended
or amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_
") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other
than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 2.6(b)) for $75.00 per share of Company Common Stock, net to the
seller in cash, without interest thereon and subject to Section 1.1(g) (such
price, or any higher price as may be paid in the Offer in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ ");

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer,
the Purchaser will, in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, merge with
and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation
of such merger (the " _Merger_ ") and each share of issued and outstanding
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as
otherwise provided herein, being converted in the Merger into the right to
receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

WHEREAS, the Company Board has as of the date hereof unanimously (a) adopted,
approved and declared the advisability of this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) declared
that it is in the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the

and that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer, in each case on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, (c) declared that the terms of the Offer and the
Merger are fair to the Company and the Companys stockholders and (d)
recommended that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender their
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Parent and the Purchaser
have adopted, approved and declared it advisable for the Parent and the
Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

 

WHEREAS, the Merger shall be governed by and effected under Section 251(h) of
the DGCL and shall be effected as soon as practicable following the
consummation of the Offer upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company, intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE CASH TENDER OFFER 

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a)  _Commencement of the Offer; Acceptance of Shares_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, provided that the Company has complied in
all material respects with its obligations under   Section 1.1(c) and Section 1.2 in each case that are required to be
performed by it prior to commencement of the Offer, as soon as practicable,
and in any event within eight (8) Business Days, after the date of this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall (and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer
to Purchase any and all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other
than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section
2.6(b)) for a price per share of Company Common Stock equal to the Offer Price
(subject to the terms of Section 1.1(b)(i)). The obligation of the Purchaser
to (and of the Parent to cause the Purchaser to) accept for purchase shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to
the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver by the
Purchaser of each of the Offer Conditions (and shall not be subject to any
other conditions). The Purchaser shall promptly after the Acceptance Time pay
for all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) in the Offer (other than shares of Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in
settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee).

 

(b) _Expiration Date; Extensions and Amendment_.

 

(i) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be at midnight, Eastern
time on the 20th Business Day after commencement of the Offer (determined in
accordance with Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act). Subject
to the immediately succeeding sentence, the Parent and the Purchaser expressly
reserve the right to (A) increase the Offer Price and (B) waive any of the
Offer Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither the Parent nor the Purchaser shall (without the prior
written consent of the Company): (1) change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, decrease the Offer Price or change the Offer so that it is for
fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock; (2) increase
the Offer Price in an increment of less than $0.25 per share except in
response to a Recommendation Change Notice or a Superior Proposal Notice; (3)
extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer, except pursuant
to Section 1.1(b)(ii); (4) change or waive the Minimum Condition; (5) amend,
modify or supplement any of the Offer Conditions or the terms of the Offer in
any manner that is adverse to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (in
their capacities as such) or that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the consummation of the Offer or
prevent, delay or impair the ability of the Parent or the Purchaser to
consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; or (6) impose any condition to the Offer other than the Offer
Conditions. Other than the Minimum Condition, the Offer Conditions are for the
sole benefit of the Parent and the Purchaser and, accordingly, the Parent and
the Purchaser may waive any such Offer Conditions, in whole or in part, at
any time and from time to time prior to the expiration of the Offer, in their
sole and absolute discretion. The failure by the Parent and the Purchaser at
any time to exercise the foregoing right to waive any Offer Condition
(other than the Minimum Condition) shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right, and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

 

(ii) The Purchaser shall extend the scheduled expiration date of the Offer:
(A) as required by applicable law (including for any period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC), and (B) if at the
then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the Offer Conditions have
not been satisfied (and the Parent or the Purchaser has not waived
such condition in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), for one or
more periods the length of each of which shall be specified by the Purchaser
(not in excess of 10 Business Days each) but not (without the prior written
consent of the Company) beyond the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this Section 1.1(b)(ii) shall not be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of the Parent to terminate this Agreement, if
permitted pursuant to the terms of Article VIII.

(c) _Schedule TO and Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the
Offer, the Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO
shall contain an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") and a form
of the related letter of transmittal (which form shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company), and ancillary documents and instruments pursuant
to which the Offer will be made 

 



\- 2 -  (collectively, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ "). The Parent and the Purchaser shall cause the Offer
Documents (i) to comply in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable U.S. federal securities laws and (ii) on the date first filed with
the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, not to contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
no covenant is made by the Parent or the Purchaser with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company in writing specifically
for inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Parent and the Purchaser shall take
all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal securities laws. Each of the Parent, the Purchaser and
the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it or on its
behalf specifically for inclusion in the Schedule TO or the other Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
law, and the Parent and the Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to amend
or supplement the Schedule TO and, as applicable, the other Offer Documents
and to cause the Schedule TO as so amended and supplemented to be filed with
the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so amended and supplemented to be
disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The Company
and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon the Offer Documents and any amendments thereto prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC or dissemination to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock. The Parent and the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel with a copy of any written comments or telephonic notification of any
oral comments the Parent, the Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the
SEC with respect to the Offer promptly after the receipt thereof, shall
consult with the Company and its counsel prior to responding to any such
comments, and shall provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any
written responses thereto and telephonic notification of any oral responses
thereto of the Parent or the Purchaser or their counsel. Subject to the
foregoing, the Parent and the Purchaser shall respond to any such comments
promptly after they are received.

 

(d) _Provisions of Funds by the Parent_. The Parent shall provide or cause to
be provided to the Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to
purchase any and all shares of Company Common Stock that the Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

 

(e) _Termination of Offer and Return of Tendered Shares_. Unless this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the Purchaser shall not
terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration date without
the prior written consent of the Company in its sole and absolute discretion.
In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,
the Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) following
such termination irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall
not acquire any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto. If the Offer
is terminated in accordance with this Agreement prior to the Acceptance Time,
the Purchaser shall promptly return, or cause any depositary acting on behalf
of the Purchaser to return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the
tendering stockholders.

 

(f) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a
record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance
Time.

(g) _Tax Withholding_. The Purchaser or any depositary acting on behalf of
the Purchaser, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer any transfer tax due
and any other amounts as the Purchaser or such depositary, as applicable, are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or under any other applicable state, local or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Purchaser or such
depositary and timely remitted by the Purchaser or such depositary to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be

 



\- 3 -  treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Purchaser or such depositary, as the case may be.

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) _Approval and Consent_. The Company hereby approves of and consents to the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) _Schedule 14D-9_. On the date of commencement of the Offer, (i)
concurrently with filing the Schedule TO with the SEC, the Company shall file
with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto,
the " _Schedule 14D-9_"), and (ii) the Company shall mail the Schedule 14D-9
along with the Offer Documents so as to disseminate the Schedule 14D-9, to the
extent required by Rule 14D-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and any other
applicable laws, to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, including
by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record date for the purpose of
receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. Except as
required by applicable law or as otherwise permitted pursuant to Section 6.1
below, the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 shall contain the
recommendation of the Company Board in favor of the Offer, and the Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of
such recommendation. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 (i) to comply
in all material respects with the requirements of applicable U.S. federal
securities laws and (ii) on the date first filed with the SEC and on the date
first published, sent or given to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except that no covenant is made by the Company with
respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Parent or the Purchaser
in writing specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the
Company, the Parent and the Purchaser shall promptly correct any information
provided by it or on its behalf specifically for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable law,
and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the
Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S.
federal securities laws.

 

(c) _Sharing of Materials and Information_.

 

(i) Except in connection with a Trigger Event, a Recommendation Change Notice
or a Superior Proposal Notice, the Parent and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and any
amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or dissemination
to holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(ii) The Company shall provide the Parent and its counsel with a copy of any
written comments or telephonic notification of any oral comments the Company
or its counsel may receive from the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after the receipt thereof, shall consult with the Parent and its
counsel prior to responding to any such comments, and shall provide the Parent
and its counsel with a copy of any written responses thereto and telephonic
notification of any oral responses thereto of the Company or its counsel. The
Company shall respond to any such comments promptly after they are received.

 

(d) _Provision of Information for Offer Documents_. The Company shall promptly
supply to the Parent and the Purchaser in writing, for inclusion in the Offer
Documents, all information concerning the Company (i) required under all
applicable laws, including U.S. federal securities laws to be included in the
Offer Documents or (ii) otherwise reasonably requested by the Parent and the
Purchaser for inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Parent and the Purchaser
shall promptly supply to the Company in writing, for inclusion in the

 



\- 4 -  Schedule 14D-9, all information concerning the Parent and the Purchaser (x)
required under all applicable laws, including U.S. federal securities laws to
be included in the Schedule 14D-9 or (y) otherwise reasonably requested by
the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9.

(e) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
cause its transfer agent to promptly furnish to the Purchaser or its
designated agent mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the
record holders of the shares of Company Common Stock as of a recent date and,
to the extent known, a list of the beneficial owners of the shares of Company
Common Stock as of a recent date, and shall furnish to the Purchaser such
information and assistance as the Purchaser may reasonably request for the
purpose of communicating the Offer to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock (the date of the list used by the Purchaser to determine the Persons to
whom the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the "
_Stockholder List Date_ "). Subject to the requirements of applicable laws
and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents
and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Parent and the
Purchaser shall, until consummation of the Offer, hold in confidence the
information contained in any of such labels and lists in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, shall use such information only in connection with
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, if this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1, shall destroy all electronic copies of such information and
deliver to the Company all other copies of such information then in their
possession or under their control.

Effective Time, they are identical to the bylaws of the Purchaser as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to
the name of the Purchaser therein shall be changed to refer to the name of the
Company, and, as so amended and restated, such bylaws shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL.
The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

 

2.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Purchaser
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case to hold office in accordance with the term
of office set forth in certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation and until their successors are duly elected and
qualified.

 

2.6 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the Purchaser, the
Parent or the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or
capital stock of the Purchaser:

(a)  _Capital Stock of the Purchaser_. Each share of the common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are held in the treasury of the Company and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by any Subsidiary of the Company, the
Parent, the Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of the Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.7,
each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.6(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.6(c) in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.7.

 

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common
Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

2.7 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Promptly following (and in any event within 24 hours of)
the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Restricted Shares
for which payment is made pursuant to Section 2.8), for payment through the
Paying Agent in accordance with this Section 2.7, the Payment Fund. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Fund shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Parent; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations

 



\- 6 -  of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank which are then publicly available); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and
the Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Payment Fund
includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy the Parents obligation to
pay the Merger Consideration under this Agreement. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments (net of any losses) shall be paid to
the Parent pursuant to Section 2.7(e). In the event the Payment Fund is
diminished below the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash
payments as required under Section 2.7(b), the Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, immediately deposit additional cash into the
Payment Fund in an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount required to
make such payments.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal in customary
form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.7(g)) to the
Paying Agent, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.7(g)) in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect
thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
as provided in Section 2.7(g)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the
terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be promptly paid in exchange therefor a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to (1) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 2.7(g)) multiplied by (2) the Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
Uncertificated Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article
II. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Uncertificated
Shares shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in
customary form with respect to any Uncertificated Share be promptly paid the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Uncertificated Share and such
Uncertificated Share shall forthwith be cancelled.

(c) _Interest; Transfers; Rights Following the Effective Time_. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares is registered, if, in the case of a Certificate, such Certificate is
presented to the Paying Agent, and in each case the transferor provides to
Paying Agent (i) all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and (ii) evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.7, each Certificate and
all Uncertificated Shares (other than Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.6(c).

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates and cancellation
of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares 

 



\- 7 -  of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II,
subject to Section 2.7(e).

 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares for one year after the Effective Time (including all interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to
it) shall be delivered to the Parent, upon demand, and any holder of
a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares who has not previously complied with
this Section 2.7 shall be entitled to receive only from the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar laws) payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without
interest.

(f) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of
the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect
to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.8 _Company Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_.

 

(i) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option that has vested as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
accelerated vesting required pursuant to an existing agreement that is set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule) shall automatically be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount
of cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock then underlying such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of such Company Stock Option, without any interest thereon. In the event that
the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled, without
any consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force
or effect.

(ii) Effective as of the Effective Time, each then-outstanding and
unexercised Company Stock Option that has not vested in accordance with its
terms as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by the
Parent and converted into an option to purchase shares of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "). Except as
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each such Company Stock Option assumed
by the Parent pursuant to this Section 2.8(a)(ii) shall continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting terms) set
forth in the applicable Company Stock Plan and any other plan, agreement or
arrangement of the Company relating to such Company Stock Option, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (x) such assumed
Company Stock Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of 

 



\- 8 -  shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and (y) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company
Stock Option shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock at which such assumed Company Stock
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, with the result rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The exercise
price of the option, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option described in this Section 2.8(a)(ii) are intended to comply
with Section 409A of the Code, and in the case of any Company Stock Option to
which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under
Section 422 of the Code, Section 424 of the Code.

 

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_.

 

(i) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A) each Company
Restricted Share award that vests in accordance with its existing terms at or
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time after giving effect to any
accelerated vesting required pursuant to an existing agreement that is set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall vest, and (B) each
Company Restricted Share award that vests in part based on the satisfaction
of performance criteria with respect to a performance period that has not
concluded by the Effective Time will be treated as satisfying the performance
criteria at the target level related to such Company Restricted Share award,
with any Company Restricted Shares covered by such award in excess of the
target level being automatically cancelled and any future rights thereto being
forfeited. The remaining number of performance-related Company Restricted
Shares after the cancellation described in the immediately preceding sentence
shall, to the extent subject to an award that vests at or as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time after giving effect to any accelerated vesting
required pursuant to an existing agreement that is set forth or otherwise
referred to on Section 3.15(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
automatically be treated as satisfying all service conditions and shall
become fully vested and the restrictions thereon shall lapse, and shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. All other
Company Restricted Shares than those described in the first sentence of this
Section 2.8(b)(i) and not accelerated as to service as described in the
immediately preceding sentence shall be assumed and treated as described in
Section 2.8(b)(ii). The Parent acknowledges and agrees that payments in
respect of Company Restricted Shares pursuant to this Section 2.8(b)(i) as to
which the election contemplated by Section 83(b) of the Code has been properly
made shall not be subject to any deductions in respect of withholding Taxes.

(ii) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unvested
Company Restricted Share award outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that vests based solely on the satisfaction of service conditions shall
be exchanged for restricted shares of Parent Common Stock that shall be
unvested and that shall have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including vesting terms) set forth in the applicable Company Stock
Plan and the Company Restricted Share agreements relating thereto, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, in an amount equal to the
number of Company Restricted Shares outstanding with respect to such unvested
Company Restricted Share award immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.

(c) _Company RSUs_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then outstanding Company RSU shall be assumed by the Parent as a Parent
restricted stock unit. Each Company RSU so assumed by the Parent pursuant to
this Section 2.8(c) shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions (including vesting terms) set forth in the applicable Company
Stock Plan and the Company RSU agreements relating thereto, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such assumed Company RSU
shall cover that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of Company Common Stock underlying such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time

 



\- 9 -  multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(d) The Parent shall (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to make the payments
contemplated by the foregoing Section 2.8(a)(i) and Section 2.8(b)(i) as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after
the Effective Time and (ii) cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain at all
times from and after the Effective Time sufficient liquid funds to satisfy
its obligations pursuant to Section 2.8(a)(i) and Section 2.8(b)(i).

(e) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall provide to each Person who is a holder of Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Shares or Company RSUs a letter describing the treatment of
and payment for such equity awards pursuant to this Section 2.8 and providing
instructions for use in obtaining payment therefor.

(f) _Company ESPP_. The current "Plan Period" (as defined in the Company
ESPP) ends June 30, 2016, and participants in the Company ESPP will be
entitled to purchase Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
current offering for such Plan Period as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. The Company Board may either cause the following Plan Period to not
begin or may terminate the Company ESPP as of a date following June 30, 2016
but prior to the Closing Date and, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following such termination, all payroll deductions pursuant to the Company
ESPP shall be paid out to the participating employees under the Company ESPP
such that no shares of Company Common Stock will be purchased in any Plan
Period beginning after the date of this Agreement (as long as the Closing
occurs). In any event, the Company Board shall terminate the Company ESPP
prior to the Effective Time.

 

(g) The Parent and the Company may agree to treat equity compensation held by
Company employees subject to non-U.S. law in another manner to take into
account applicable non-U.S. law or Tax or employment considerations.

(h) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days following the Effective Time), the Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (if available for use by the
Parent) registering the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of all assumed Company Stock Options, settlement of assumed
Company RSUs and exchange of substituted Company Restricted Shares, in each
case that are eligible to be registered on Form S-8; provided, however,
that (A) in the event that the filing deadline contemplated by this Section
2.8(h) shall occur during a trading "blackout" period under the Parents
securities trading policies, then the Parent shall not be required to file
the registration statement contemplated by this Section 2.8(h) until such
"blackout" period is no longer applicable, and (B) the Parent shall not be
deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder if the Parent shall fail
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 2.8(h) at a time when trading
of the Parent Common Stock has been suspended globally under the Parents
then-effective registration statements (it being understood and agreed that if
the Parent is unable to file such registration statement on Form S-8 due to a
global trading suspension under the Parents then-effective registration
statements, then the Parent shall file such registration statement as soon as
practicable after trading has been restored).

2.9 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.6(c), but shall
be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of
Dissenting Shares.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.6(c), and shall not thereafter
be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.

 



\- 10 - (c) The Company shall give the Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL that relates to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or make or accept any
payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument unless the Parent shall have given its
written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

 

2.10 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted
Shares, Company RSUs or Dissenting Shares any transfer tax due and any other
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, the Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, and timely
remitted by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
thereof in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, the Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1 _No Solicitation_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
until the Specified Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

officers not to, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its other

discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or any

relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford access to
the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries;

(iii) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement
providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal or any indication of interest that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 6.1(a) entered into in the circumstances
referred to in Section 6.1(a)); or

 

(iv) terminate, amend, waive or fail to enforce any rights under any
"standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Person (other than the Parent).

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to any Qualified Person (and the Representatives
of such Qualified Person), or (B) participate or engage in discussions
or negotiations (including solicitation of revised Acquisition Proposals)
with any Qualified Person (and the Representatives of such Qualified Person)
regarding any such Acquisition Proposal or (C) amend, or grant a waiver or
release under, any standstill or similar agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A),
(B) or (C), (1) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have
breached or violated in any material respect the terms of this Section 6.1 in
connection with such Qualified Person, (2) prior to taking any of the actions
set forth in clause (A) or (B) with respect to a Qualified Person, (x)
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law, (y) the
Company shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement the terms of
which are no less favorable with respect to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement (which confidentiality agreement shall not include
any provisions that would prevent or restrict the Company or its
Representatives from providing any information to the Parent to which the
Parent

 



\- 31 -  would be entitled under any provision of this Agreement) and (z) the Company
shall have given the Parent written notice of the Companys determination that
such Person is a Qualified Person and (3) contemporaneously with furnishing
any information to such Person, the Company furnishes such information to the
Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished or
made available by the Company to the Parent).

(b) _No Change in Recommendation_. Prior to the Specified Time:

 

(i) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, in any such case in a manner
adverse to the Parent, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board
with respect to the Offer;

 

(ii) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
adopt, approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or fail to publicly
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange
offer within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of such offer (and at
all times thereafter during which any such tender offer or exchange offer
is pending);

(iii) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
fail to include the approval or recommendation by the Company Board with
respect to the Offer in the Schedule 14D-9; or

(iv) the Company Board shall not, except as set forth in this Section 6.1,
publicly propose to take any of the foregoing actions (any action described in
the preceding clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) being referred to herein as a "
_Company Board Recommendation Change_ "). 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement (including the provisions of this Section 6.1), at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may (I) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event or (II)
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith constitutes a
Superior Proposal (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel), in each case, only if: (i) in the case of (II), neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has breached in any material respect the
provisions of this Section 6.1 with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and after considering any offer made by the Parent
pursuant to clause (v) below) that the failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
under applicable law; (iii) the Company has notified the Parent in writing
that it intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change, describing in
reasonable detail the reasons for such Company Board Recommendation Change (a
" _Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (it being understood that the
Recommendation Change Notice shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change or a Trigger Event for purposes of this Agreement),
which notice shall attach the agreement providing for such Superior Proposal
and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, or provide a
summary of the Company Intervening Event, as applicable; (iv) if requested by
the Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives available to
discuss with the Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement during the four (4) Business Day period
following delivery by the Company to the Parent of such Recommendation Change
Notice; and (v) if the Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written,
binding and irrevocable offer to alter the terms or conditions of this
Agreement during such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel), after considering the terms of such offer by the
Parent, that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would
still be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law
and, in the case of (II), the applicable proposal still constitutes a Superior
Proposal (it being understood and hereby agreed that every subsequent material
revision or material modification to any such Superior Proposal shall require
a new Recommendation Change Notice by the Company to the Parent pursuant to
the preceding clause (iii) and a new two (2) Business Day "matching" period
under the preceding clauses (iv) and (v) following the initial four

 



\- 32 -  (4)-Business Day "matching" period). For clarity, a Recommendation Change
Notice is separate from and need not precede or accompany a Superior Proposal
Notice (as defined and provided for in Section 8.1(e)).

(c) _Notices to the Parent_. The Company shall promptly (within one (1)
Business Day) advise the Parent orally, with written confirmation to follow
within such period, of the Companys receipt of (i) any written Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry that would reasonably
be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, in each case, including the
material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry (unless such Acquisition Proposal is in written form, in which case
the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof and any material amendments or
modifications thereto), and the identity of the Person making any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with
respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement
pending disclosure of its position thereunder (which "stop, look and listen"
statement, in and of itself, shall not be deemed to constitute an adverse
Company Board Recommendation Change); _provided_ , that any "stop, look and
listen" statement also includes an express reaffirmation of the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board with respect to the Offer.

 

(e) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall direct
its Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations
that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days following the date hereof) request in writing that each Person
which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
its consideration of acquiring the Company or any portion thereof to return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on behalf of the Company.

6.2 _New York Stock Exchange Listing_. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to continue the listing of the Company Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange during the term of this Agreement.

 

6.3 _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Parent and the Company have
previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms, except as expressly
modified herein.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each of its Representatives to) afford to the Parents Representatives,
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and
in a manner that does not disrupt or interfere with business operations, to
its officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, facilities, books,
contracts and records as the Parent shall reasonably request, and, during
such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its
Representatives to) furnish promptly (to the extent not otherwise publicly
available) to the Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed or received by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (ii) all
other information concerning its business, properties and assets as the
Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that no information or
knowledge obtained by the Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to
this Section 6.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive (i) any right
or claim of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth herein, or (ii) any
condition to the obligations of the Parent and the Purchaser to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the

 



\- 33 -  Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company shall not be required to permit any inspection or
other access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment
of the Company would: (A) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any
third party, (B) violate any legal requirement or contract or any obligation
of the Company with respect to confidentiality or privacy, including under
any privacy policy, or (C) jeopardize protections afforded the Company under
the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine. The
parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the immediately preceding proviso apply. The Parent will hold
any such information which is non-public in confidence in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to the Closing, neither the Parent nor
the Purchaser shall (and each shall cause their Affiliates and Representatives
not to) contact or communicate with any of the employees, customers, partners,
licensors or suppliers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without the
prior written consent of the Company.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1, Section 6.4(b),
Section 6.4(c) and Section 6.4(d), the Company and the Parent shall each use
(and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable
best efforts to:

 

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable;

 

(ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders
required to be obtained or made by the Company or the Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or order by any Governmental
Entity, in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger;

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer
and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable
federal or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act, any other applicable
Antitrust Laws and any related governmental request thereunder and (C) any
other applicable law;

(iv) contest and resist any action, including any administrative or judicial
action, and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) (a " _Restrictive Order_ ") which has the effect of prohibiting
consummation of the Offer or making the Merger illegal or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and

(v) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The Company and the Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings and submissions contemplated by the foregoing
clause (iii), including by providing copies of all such documents to the non-
filing Person and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, accepting
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith.
The Company and the Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to furnish to each other all information required for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to any applicable law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and the Parent may,
as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other pursuant to this Section 6.4
as "Outside Counsel Only Material," and may redact the materials as necessary
(A) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, (B) to

 



\- 34 -  comply with contractual arrangements and (C) to address reasonable attorney-
client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parent and the Company agree that nothing contained in this
Section 6.4(a) shall modify or affect their respective rights and
responsibilities under Section 6.4(c).

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.4,
each of the Parent and the Company shall (i) as soon as reasonably
practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date
of this Agreement, if required, make an appropriate filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (including seeking early termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, make appropriate initial filings, if
any, pursuant to any other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto shall bear its
own expenses in connection with any filings and actions contemplated pursuant
to this Section 6.4. None of the Parent, the Purchaser or the Company shall
commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws
or enter into a timing agreement with any Governmental Entity, without the
prior written consent of the other parties.

(c) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.4(d), the Parent and the
Company will, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate and to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any
government clearances or approvals required for Closing under any applicable
Antitrust Laws, to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
government requests for information under any applicable Antitrust Laws, and
to cause any waiting periods under any applicable Antitrust Laws to expire or
be terminated. Each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt
notice of any request, inquiry, objection, charge or other Action, actual or
threatened, by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer,
the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
objection, charge or other Action, (iii) promptly inform the other parties of
any communication to or from any Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or
the Merger and (iv) permit the other parties to review in advance, and
consider in good faith any comments made by the other parties in relation to,
any proposed substantive communication by such party to any Governmental
Entity relating to such matters. The parties hereto will (A) use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve any such request, inquiry, objection,
charge or other action so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with the Offer, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Such cooperation shall include consulting with each other in
advance of any meeting or substantive communication with any Governmental
Entity and, to the extent permitted by law or such applicable Governmental
Entity, providing each other the opportunity to participate in such meetings
and other substantive conversations.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Parent, the Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to, and
the Company may not, without the prior written consent of the Parent, become
subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action
with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent, the Purchaser or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or
otherwise change the assets, business or portion of business of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, the Parent, the Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in any manner or (iii) impose any restriction,
requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the
business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Parent, the Purchaser
or any of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that if requested by
the Parent, the Company will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree
to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any such requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long as such
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only
binding on the Company in the event the Closing occurs.

 



\- 35 - 6.5 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock market
regulations (in which cases the party subject to such requirement shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party with respect
to any such required disclosure), (a) the press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Parent and (b) the Parent and the
Company shall obtain the prior written consent of the other party before
issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that these restrictions shall not apply to any Company communications to the
extent relating to a Trigger Event, a Superior Proposal Notice or a
Recommendation Change Notice.

6.6 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Acceptance Time, each of the Parent and, from and after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another Person, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in all cases to the full
extent provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company
and indemnification agreements between the Company and any of its Indemnified
Parties, in all cases as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) From the Effective Time through the six (6) year anniversary of the date
on which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and the Parent shall cause
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so
contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and
former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are set
forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in
effect on the date of this Agreement. 

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
maintain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain,
at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the
Effective Time the Current DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would
not exceed the Maximum Premium, or (ii) purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement
for an annual cost not to exceed the Maximum Premium and maintain
such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If the Companys
or the Surviving Corporations existing insurance expires, is terminated or
cancelled during such six (6) year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium,
the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and the Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain, either (A) as much directors and officers
liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium or (B) a Reporting
Tail Endorsement for the remainder of such period for an annual cost not to
exceed the Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to
the Indemnified Parties than the Current DandO Insurance. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may, prior to the
Acceptance Time, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided that the
Company does not pay more than the Maximum Premium for such Reporting Tail
Endorsement. If the Company purchases a Reporting Tail Endorsement in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, then the Parent shall be
relieved from its obligations pursuant to Section 6.6(c)(i) so long as
the Parent maintains, or causes the Surviving Corporation to maintain, as
applicable, such Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its
full term.

 

(d) In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any 

 



\- 36 -  Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall expressly assume and succeed to the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.6.

(e) If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification
or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.6 that is denied by the
Parent and/or the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
such indemnification or advancement of expenses, then the Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Indemnified Partys costs and
expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with pursuing his or her claims to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to any Indemnified Party by law, charter, statute,
bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.

 

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Specified Time, the Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt
notice to the Parent, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such Person contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate (i) in the case of the Company, in any manner that
would result in the failure of the condition set forth in clause (c)(ii) of
_Annex I_ or (ii) in the case of the Parent, that has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, in each case at any time
from and after the date of this Agreement until the Specified Time or (b) any
material failure of the Parent and the Purchaser or the Company, as the case
may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it under this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that the Companys
compliance or failure to comply with this Section 6.7 shall not be taken into
account for purposes of determining whether the condition referred to in

6.8 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Acceptance Time, the Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, carry out all employer responsibilities under all
Company Employee Plans and all employment, severance and termination plans and
agreements, in each case in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Acceptance Time. Subject to the foregoing, for
a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Parent shall provide,
or shall cause to be provided, to each Company Employee (i) a base salary,
commissions, and annual bonus substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
the total cash compensation package (including base salary, commissions and
annual bonus, but excluding any equity awards or equity based benefits)
provided to each such employee immediately before the Acceptance Time and (ii)
other employee benefits (excluding any equity awards or equity based
benefits) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other
benefits provided to such employees immediately before the Acceptance Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent shall be entitled to adjust the
Companys sales commission plan to align with the Parents sales commission
plan after the end of the Parents current fiscal year.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the New Plans, each Company Employee
shall, subject to applicable law and applicable tax qualification
requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Acceptance
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Acceptance Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Employee
benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Acceptance Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) each Company 

 



\- 37 -  Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
of the same type as the Company Employee Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Acceptance Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii)(A) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee,
the Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the Old
Plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Acceptance Time and (B) the Parent shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) If any Company Employee (who is not otherwise a party to an employment
agreement that provides for severance) whose employment is terminated on or
prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time under circumstances under
which such Company Employee would have received severance benefits under the
Company Severance Practices, the Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide that such Company Employee shall be entitled to severance benefits
from the Surviving Corporation that are equal to the greater of (i) the
severance benefits that would have been paid under the Company Severance
Practices as in existence on the date of this Agreement or (ii) the severance
benefits payable under similar circumstances pursuant to a severance plan of
the Parent or its Affiliates as may be in effect at such time for
similarly situated United States employees of the Parent and its Affiliates
and giving effect to the provisions of this Section 6.8.

(d) From and after the Acceptance Time, the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance with their terms, all
contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the
Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company as in effect immediately prior to
the Acceptance Time that are applicable to any current or former employees or
directors of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

 

(e) The provisions of Sections 6.8(a) through 6.8(c) shall not apply to
persons employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries outside the United
States, it being agreed that such persons shall be treated in accordance with
applicable law and the terms of any contracts covering them.

 

(f) Unless the Parent provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k)
plan(s) shall not be terminated, the Company shall terminate any and all
401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliates, in each case
effective as of the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a
member of the same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section
414(b) of the Code) as the Parent (the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "). The
Company shall provide the Parent evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of
the Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable. The Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating any such 401(k) plans as the Parent may reasonably request. If the
Company 401(k) plan is terminated hereto as of the 401(k) Termination Date,
the Parent shall permit Company Employees to roll over their account balances
(including loan notes) to a 401(k) plan of the Parent or an Affiliate of the
Parent.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall, or shall be construed so as to,
(i) prevent or restrict in any way the right of the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate or cause to terminate the employment or service of
any employee, independent contractor, director or other service provider of
the Company or its Subsidiaries in a manner consistent with any
applicable individual agreements covering such service providers at any time
following the Closing Date; (ii) constitute an amendment or modification of
any plan; (iii) create any third party rights in any such current or former
service provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including

 



\- 38 -  any beneficiary or dependent thereof); or (iv) obligate the Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to adopt or maintain any particular plan or program or
other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time or prevent the Parent
or the Surviving Corporation from modifying or terminating any such plan,
program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time.

combination" or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute
or regulation is or may become applicable to this Agreement or the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take such

to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
a director or officer of the Company and who would otherwise be subject to
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable law.

6.11 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary (but subject in all respects to Section 5.1), the Company shall not,
from and after the date hereof and until the Specified Time, enter into,
establish, amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement
pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which
benefits are provided, in each case to any current or former director,
manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company, unless
prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the
compensation committee of the Company Board (each member of which the Company
Board determined is an "independent director" within the meaning of the
applicable New York Stock Exchange Rules and shall be an "independent
director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps
as may reasonably be necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with
respect to such plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

 

6.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys rights
or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree that
(a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Parent or the
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys operations prior to the Acceptance Time and (b) prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries operations.

commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors
by any stockholders of the Company (on their own behalf or on behalf of the
Company) relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) and shall keep the Parent reasonably
and regularly informed regarding any such litigation.

(b) The Company shall give the Parent the opportunity to consult with the
Company regarding the defense or settlement of any litigation filed against
the Company or any of its directors or officers in connection with any of the

result from or arise in connection with a material breach of Section 6.1; (ii)

or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in clauses (c)(ii) or
(c)(iv) of _Annex I_ not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured
within 20 Business Days following receipt by the Company of written notice of
such breach or failure to perform from the Parent; _provided_ that neither the

shall receive the Termination Fee, the receipt of such fee shall be deemed to
be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred

Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and none of the Parent, the Purchaser,

party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for performance,
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any
agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified
in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights.

8.6 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, an amendment, modification or
supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4 or an extension or waiver
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.5 shall, in order to be effective,

\- 54 - Any party hereto may give any notice or other communication hereunder using
any other means (including personal delivery, messenger service, or ordinary
mail), but no such notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been
duly given unless and until it actually is received by the party for whom it
is intended. Any party hereto may change the address to which notices and
other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties
hereto notice in the manner herein set forth.

 

10.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto,
or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

10.4 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of Section
6.6 (with respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries).

10.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

 

10.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement
that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions (or parts thereof) hereof or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision (or part thereof) in any other situation or in
any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision (or part thereof) hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision (or part
thereof), to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with a term or provision (or
part thereof) that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or
part thereof), and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision (or part thereof) with a valid and enforceable term or
provision (or part thereof) that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term
(or part thereof).

10.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered
by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall
become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by electronic mail.

10.8 _Interpretation_. Except where expressly stated otherwise in this
Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (a)

caption of this Agreement; (d) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means
the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does

any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement; (f) definitions

 



\- 55 -  contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms; (g) references to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns; (h) references to an "Article", "Section",

shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

10.10 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Person will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Person, and
the exercise by a Person of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in the event of
any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or the
Parent and/or the Purchaser, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one
hand, and the Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall be entitled
to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to
seek to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement, in each case
without posting a bond or other security. The parties hereto hereby agree not
to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by such party, and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party
under this Agreement. Time shall be of the essence for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

10.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have
jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such
court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense
of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so
brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required
of any other Person with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service
on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party
to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of
notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in this Section 10.11, however, shall affect
the right of any Person to serve legal process in any other manner permitted
by law.

 



\- 56 - 10.12 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged
in sections and subsections corresponding to the numbered sections or
subsections contained in this Agreement, and the disclosure in any section or
subsection shall qualify (a) the corresponding section or subsection of this
Agreement and (b) such other sections or subsections of this Agreement, to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure or
the related representation that it also qualifies or applies to such other
sections or subsections. The inclusion of any information in the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be
disclosed, is material, has resulted in or would result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

10.13 _Parent Guarantee_. The Parent agrees to take all action necessary to
cause the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and, during
the period between the Acceptance Time and the Effective Time, the Company, to
perform all of its agreements, covenants and obligations under
this Agreement. The Parent unconditionally guarantees to the Company the full
and complete performance by the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, of its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be
liable for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
of the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this
Agreement. The Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of
performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any proceeding first
against the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, protest,
notice and all defenses and demands whatsoever in connection with the
performance of its obligations set forth in this Section 10.13. The Parent
shall not have any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnity
whatsoever, nor any right of recourse to security for any of the agreements,
covenants and obligations of the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation under
this Agreement.

accordance with the Agreement), the number of shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn (without regard to shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that
have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee),
together with any shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the
Parent or any Subsidiary of the Parent, does not equal at least one share
more than half of the sum of (i) all shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding plus (ii) all shares of Company Common Stock issuable to holders
of Company Stock Options from whom the Company has received notices of
exercise (and as to which shares of Company Common stock have not yet been
issued to such exercising holders of Company Stock Options) (the "Minimum

(b) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer (as extended in
accordance with the Agreement), any waiting period (and any

Merger) any order, executive order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction
(preliminary or permanent) or statute, rule or regulation which has
the effect of prohibiting the consummation of the Offer and the Merger or
making the consummation of the Offer and the Merger illegal or otherwise
preventing the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or (B) issued or
granted any order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction (preliminary or
permanent) that remains in effect and has the effect of prohibiting the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger or making the consummation of the
Offer and the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger; _provided_ , that the failure of this clause (i) to be
satisfied shall not have resulted from a material breach by the Parent or the
Purchaser of any of their obligations under the Agreement; 

(ii) (A) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 3.1 (Organization, Standing and Power), Section 3.4(a) (Authority),
Section 3.20 (Brokers) and Section 3.25 (No Rights Plan) of this Agreement
(collectively, the "Specified Representations") shall not have been true and
correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement or shall
not be true and correct in all material respects as of the Acceptance Time, as
though made at and as of the Acceptance Time (other than any such

 



Annex I  Page 1   representation or warranty that is made only as of a specified date, which
need only be true and correct in all material respects as of such specified
date); (B) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 3.2 (Capitalization) of this Agreement (the "Capitalization
Representation") shall not have been true and correct other than for _de
minimis_ inaccuracies as of the date of this Agreement or shall not be true
and correct other than for _de minimis_ inaccuracies as of the Acceptance
Time, as though made at and as of the Acceptance Time (other than any such
representation or warranty that is made only as of a specified date, which
need only be true and correct other than for _de minimis_ inaccuracies as of
such specified date); or (C) any of the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in this Agreement (other than the Specified Representations
and the Capitalization Representation) that (i) are not made as of a specific
date shall not have been true and correct as of the date of this Agreement or
shall not be true and correct as of the Acceptance Time, as though made at
and as of the Acceptance Time, and (ii) are made as of a specific date are not
true and correct as of such date, in each case, except in the case of this
clause (C) where the failure of such representations or warranties to be true
and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" set forth in such representations and
warranties, other than the "Company Material Adverse Effect" limitation
set forth in the first sentence of Section 3.7) is not reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(iii) any Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred or exist at or
prior to the Acceptance Time and shall be continuing as of immediately prior

(iv) the Company shall have materially breached or failed to perform in a
material respect any of its covenants and obligations required to be
performed or complied with by it under the Agreement at or prior to the
Acceptance Time;

executed by the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer

 _Form of Certificate of Incorporation_

 

 _of the Surviving Corporation_

 

FORM OF AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF

 

DEMANDWARE, INC.

(originally incorporated as SSE Holdings, Inc. on February 18, 2004)

FIRST: The name of the Corporation is: Demandware, Inc.

 

SECOND: The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of
Delaware is Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, in the City of
Wilmington, County of New Castle 19801. The name of its registered agent at
that address is The Corporation Trust Company.

 

THIRD: The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted by
the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

FOURTH: The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per
share.

The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased
(but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the
General Corporation Law of Delaware.

FIFTH: In furtherance of and not in limitation of powers conferred by
statute, it is further provided:(i) the business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors; (ii) election of directors need not be by written ballot; and (iii)
the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or
repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation.

SIXTH: Except to the extent that the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of directors for
breaches of fiduciary duty, no director of the Corporation shall be personally
liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any
breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision of law
imposing such liability. No amendment to or repeal of this provision shall
apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of
any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions
of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. If the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended to permit further
elimination or limitation of the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to
the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware as so amended.

 

SEVENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute and this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and all rights conferred
upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

 

EIGHTH: The Corporation shall provide indemnification as follows:

 

1\. Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the
Corporation. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a
party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or  completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of
the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has
agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was
serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a
director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity
with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being
referred to hereafter as an "Indemnitee"), or by reason of any action alleged
to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses
(including attorneys fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including
excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974), and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in
a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to,
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct
was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or
its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that Indemnitee did
not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to
be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe
that his or her conduct was unlawful.

 

2\. Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation. The Corporation
shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in
the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of
the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a director
or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve,
at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, employee
or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee
benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or
omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees)
and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if Indemnitee acted in
good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that no
indemnification shall be made under this Section 2 in respect of any claim,
issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable
to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of
Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such
liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including
attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court
shall deem proper.

 

3\. Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Article EIGHTH, to the extent that an Indemnitee has
been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article EIGHTH, or in
defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such
action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or on
behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing,
if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise
(including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being
adverse to Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that Indemnitee was liable to the
Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by Indemnitee, (iv) an
adjudication that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or
she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication
that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful, Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been
wholly successful with respect thereto.

 

4\. Notification and Defense of Claim. As a condition precedent to an
Indemnitees right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the
Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding
or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity will or could
be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of
which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to  participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof
at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee.
After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its election so to assume
such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal
or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection with such
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in
this Section 4\. Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own
counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from
the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the
expense of Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has
been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to Indemnitee shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on
any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of
the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation or (iii) the
Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of
such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in each of which cases the
fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the
Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article EIGHTH.
The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to
assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation
or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the
conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The Corporation shall not be
required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Article EIGHTH for any amounts
paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation effected
without its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any action,
suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner which would impose any penalty
or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitees written consent. Neither the
Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to
any proposed settlement.

5\. Advance of Expenses. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this
Article EIGHTH, in the event of any threatened or pending action, suit,
proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under
this Article EIGHTH, any expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by or
on behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such matter; provided, however, that the
payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in advance of
the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in
the event that it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article
EIGHTH. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial
ability of Indemnitee to make such repayment.

 

6\. Procedure for Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. In order to
obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3
or 5 of this Article EIGHTH, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a
written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and
in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written
request of Indemnitee, unless the Corporation has assumed the defense pursuant
to Section 4 of this Article EIGHTH (and none of the circumstances described
in Section 4 of this Article EIGHTH that would nonetheless entitle
the Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and expenses of separate
counsel have occurred). Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court,
shall be made with respect to requests under Section 1 or 2 only as authorized
in the specific case upon a determination by the Corporation that the
indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may
be. Such determination shall be made in each instance (a) by a majority vote
of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that
time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question ("disinterested
directors"), whether or not a quorum, (b) by a committee of disinterested
directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or
not a quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested directors, or if the
disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to
the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to the Corporation) in a
written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the Corporation.

 

7\. Remedies. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as
granted by this Article EIGHTH shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation to
have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the
applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the  Corporation pursuant to Section 6 of this Article EIGHTH that Indemnitee has
not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action
or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct. In any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall have
the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to
such advancement of expenses, under this Article EIGHTH. Indemnitees expenses
(including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred in connection with
successfully establishing Indemnitees right to indemnification, in whole or
in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification hereunder it shall be a defense that the Indemnitee
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 

8\. Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article
EIGHTH, except as set forth in Section 7 of this Article EIGHTH, the
Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article EIGHTH
in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee
unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article EIGHTH,
the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the extent such
Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the
Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an Indemnitee and such
Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, such
Indemnitee shall promptly refund indemnification payments to the Corporation
to the extent of such insurance reimbursement.

 

9\. Subsequent Amendment. No amendment, termination or repeal of this Article
EIGHTH or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall adversely affect or
diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the
provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or
facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or
repeal.

 

10\. Other Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by
this Article EIGHTH shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
Indemnitees official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while
holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who
has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the
estate, heirs, executors and administrators of Indemnitee. Nothing contained
in this Article EIGHTH shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is
specifically authorized to enter into, agreements with officers and directors
providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set
forth in this Article EIGHTH. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent
authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification
rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons
serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or
less than, those set forth in this Article EIGHTH.

 

11\. Partial Indemnification. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any provision
of this Article EIGHTH to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a
portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees), liabilities, losses,
judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) or amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection
with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom
but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including
attorneys fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including excise
taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974) or amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is entitled.

12\. Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense,
liability or loss incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out
of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would  have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 

13\. Savings Clause. If this Article EIGHTH or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses
(including attorneys fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including
excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974) and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to
the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article EIGHTH
that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.

 

14\. Definitions. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and Section
145(i) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall have the
respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section
145(i).
