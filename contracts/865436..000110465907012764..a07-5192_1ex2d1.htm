this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger, and Purchaser and or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Purchaser
(in each case, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of     

Merger Sub) has adopted the "agreement of merger" set forth in this Agreement
in each case, in accordance with the DGCL;

  

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the parties hereto have entered into a Tender and Support Agreement, dated

 **ARTICLE I 
 THE OFFER**

  

SECTION 1.1. _The Offer_.

  

(a) (i) Merger Sub shall, and Purchaser shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
(but in no event later than February 27, 2007) commence (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, at the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of
Purchaser to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and to pay for any
shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall
be subject to only those conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto (the "
_Offer Conditions_ "). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the
twentieth business day following (and including the day of) the commencement
of the Offer. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right (but shall not be
obligated) at any time or from time to time in its sole discretion to waive
any Offer Condition or modify or amend the terms of the Offer, except that,
without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (A)
decrease the Offer Price or change the form of the consideration payable in
the Offer, (B) decrease the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought
pursuant to the Offer, (C) amend or waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as
defined in _Exhibit A_), (D) add to the conditions set forth on _Exhibit
A_, (E) amend or modify the conditions set forth on _Exhibit A_ in a manner
adverse to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, (F) extend the
expiration of the Offer except as required or permitted by _Section
1.1(a)(ii) or (iii)_, or (G) make any other change in the terms or conditions
of the Offer which is adverse to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock.

  

(ii) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of the Offer
Conditions as of the time of any scheduled expiration of the Offer (including
at the expiration of any extension of the Offer as described below), Merger
Sub shall, and Purchaser shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and
promptly pay for shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer. Merger Sub may, without the consent of
the Company, (A) extend the Offer for one or more periods of time of up
to twenty business days per extension if at any scheduled expiration of the
Offer any of the Offer Conditions are not satisfied, until such time as such
Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived, (B) extend the Offer

        

for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff
thereof or the Nasdaq Global Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") applicable to the Offer,
or (C) elect to provide a subsequent offering period for the Offer in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, provided that Merger Sub
shall not extend the Offer pursuant to clause (A) of this Section beyond the
Outside Date without the consent of the Company.  The Offer Price may be
increased, and the Offer may be extended to the extent required by law in
connection with such increase in the Offer Price, in each case without the
consent of the Company.

  

(iii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall
extend the Offer on one or more occasions for periods determined by Merger
Sub of up to twenty business days per extension if, at any scheduled
expiration of the Offer, any of the Offer Conditions have not been satisfied
or waived; _provided_ , that (A) if all Offer Conditions other than the
Minimum Tender Condition are satisfied or waived as of any scheduled
expiration of the Offer, Merger Sub shall not be obligated to extend the
Offer unless required by applicable Law or any applicable rule or regulation
of any stock exchange (but shall be entitled to extend the Offer), and (B) if
at any scheduled expiration of the Offer (x) the Offer Condition set forth in
Paragraph 2(a) of _Exhibit A_ has not been satisfied or waived (other than
by reason of a judgment, injunction or order that is not final or remains
subject to appeal) or (y) the Offer Condition set forth in Paragraph 2(d) of
_Exhibit A_ has not been satisfied or waived by Merger Sub and, in the case
of clause (y), the breach or failure to perform or comply that has caused
such non-satisfaction is not capable of being cured within 30 days after
receipt by the Company of notice of such breach or failure or, if capable of
being cured within such period, has not been cured within such period, then
Merger Sub shall not be obligated (but shall be entitled) to extend the
Offer; _provided_ , _further_ , that Merger Sub shall not, and shall not be
required to, extend the Offer (1) beyond the Outside Date or (2) at any time
that it is permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_.

  

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall
(i) file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer which shall contain the offer to
purchase and related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and
other ancillary documents and instruments required thereby pursuant to which
the Offer will be made (collectively with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Company Common Stock. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents prior to their filing with the SEC, and the Purchaser and Merger
Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made
by Company and their counsel.  Purchaser and Merger Sub agree to provide the
Company with (i) any comments or other communications, whether written or
oral that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt thereof and prior to responding thereto and
(ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Purchaser and
Merger Sub to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to
which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by
participating with Purchaser and Merger Sub or their counsel in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Closing,
any information relating to the Offer, the Merger, the Company, Purchaser,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers,
should be

        

discovered by the Company or Purchaser which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company, as and to the extent required by applicable
law or any applicable rule or regulation of any stock exchange.

  

(c) Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and Merger Sub
shall maintain such funds exclusively for such purpose.

  

SECTION 1.2. _Company Consent; Schedule 14D-9_.

  

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer.

  

(b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed, the Company shall file with
the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together
with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_")
containing, subject to _Section 5.3_, the recommendations of the Company
Board described in _Section 4.4(b)_. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub
shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning
Purchaser or Merger Sub that may be required by applicable securities laws or
reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the recommendations of the
Company Board described in _Section 4.4(b)_ in the Offer Documents (it being
understood that such consent shall not be deemed to limit the Company BoardÂ’s
rights under _Section 5.3_) and to the inclusion of a copy of the Schedule
14D-9 with the Offer Documents mailed or furnished to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders. Purchaser and Merger Sub shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its filing
with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by Purchaser and Merger Sub and
their counsel. The Company agrees to provide Purchaser and Merger Sub with
(i) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that may
be received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly upon receipt thereof and prior to responding thereto and (ii) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of the Company to those
comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and
good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with the
Company or their counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC. If at
any time prior to the Closing, any information relating to the Offer, the
Merger, the Company, Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company,
Purchaser or Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Schedule 14D-9, so that the Schedule 14D-9 shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the

        

stockholders of the Company, as and to the extent required by applicable law
or any applicable rule or regulation of any stock exchange.

  

SECTION 1.3. _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the
Company shall cause its transfer agent to, promptly (but in any event on or
before February 23, 2007), furnish Purchaser and Merger Sub with mailing
labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer
file containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares
as of the latest practicable date and shall furnish Purchaser and Merger Sub
with such information and assistance (including periodic updates of
such information) as Purchaser or Merger Sub or their agents may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
the Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for
such actions as are reasonably necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents
and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder, Merger Sub shall hold all
information and documents provided to it under this _Section 1.3_ in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, and shall
use such information and documents only in connection with the Offer, and if
this Agreement shall have been terminated, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall
promptly deliver (and use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause
their agents to deliver) to the Company all such information and documents
(and all copies, extracts or summaries thereof).

  

SECTION 1.4. _Directors_.

  

(a) Promptly upon the purchase by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer of such
number of Shares as represents at least a majority of the then-outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, and from time to time thereafter, Merger Sub
shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Company Board as will give Merger Sub
representation on the Company Board equal to the product of (x) the total
number of directors on the Company Board (after giving effect to any increase
in the number of directors pursuant to this _Section 1.4_) and (y) the
percentage that such number of Shares so purchased bears to the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, and the Company shall, upon
request by Merger Sub, promptly increase the size of the Company Board or use
its reasonable best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of
directors as is necessary to provide Merger Sub with such level
of representation and shall cause Merger SubÂ’s designees to be so elected
or appointed. The Company shall also use its reasonable best efforts to
cause individuals designated by Merger Sub to constitute the same percentage
of each committee of the Company Board as the percentage of the entire
Company Board represented by individuals designated by Merger Sub. The
CompanyÂ’s obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be
subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. At the request of Merger Sub,
the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect any such election
or appointment of Merger SubÂ’s designees, including mailing to its
stockholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder which, unless Merger Sub
otherwise elects, shall be so mailed on a date not less than ten (10) days
prior to the expiration of the initial Offer.  Purchaser and Merger Sub will
supply to the Company all information with respect to themselves and their
respective officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder.

  

(b) Following the election or appointment of Merger SubÂ’s designees pursuant
to _Section 1.4(a)_ and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or
termination of this Agreement

        

requiring action by the Company Board, any extension of time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Purchaser or Merger
Sub under this Agreement, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions under this Agreement that are for the benefit of the Company,
any exercise of the CompanyÂ’s rights or remedies under this Agreement, any
action to seek to enforce any obligation of Purchaser or Merger Sub under
this Agreement (or any other action by the Company Board with respect to this
Agreement or the Merger if such other action adversely affects, or could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock other than Purchaser or Merger Sub) may only be
authorized by, and will require the authorization of, a majority of the
directors of the Company then in office who were not designated by Merger
Sub.

  

(c) In the event that PurchaserÂ’s designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.4(a)_, until the Effective Time, (i)
the Company Board shall have at least such number of directors as may be
required by the Nasdaq rules or the federal securities laws who are
considered independent directors within the meaning of such rules and laws ("
_Independent Directors_ ") and (ii) each committee of the Company Board that
is required (or a majority of which is required) by the Nasdaq rules or the
federal securities laws to be composed solely of Independent Directors shall
be so composed; _provided_ , _however_ , that in such event, if the number of
Independent Directors shall be reduced below the number of directors as may
be required by such rules or laws for any reason whatsoever, the remaining
Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such
vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director then

  

remains, the other directors shall designate such number of directors as may
be required by the Nasdaq rules and the federal securities laws, to fill such
vacancies who shall not be stockholders or Affiliates of Purchaser or Merger
Sub, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of this Agreement.

  

SECTION 1.5. _Top-Up Option_.

  

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Merger Sub an option (the "
_Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only after the acceptance by Merger Sub of,
and payment for, Shares tendered in the Offer, to purchase that number (but
not less than that number) of Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") as is equal to
the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by
Purchaser, Merger Sub and any Subsidiaries or Affiliates of Purchaser or
Merger Sub, taken as a whole, at the time of such exercise, shall constitute
one share more than 90% of the total shares of Company Common Stock then
outstanding (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares) at a price per share
equal to the Offer Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall
the Top-Up Option be exercisable (x) for a number of shares of Company Common
Stock in excess of the CompanyÂ’s then authorized and unissued shares of
Common Stock (including as authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock,
for purposes of this _Section 1.5_, any shares of Company Common Stock held
in the treasury of the Company), or (y) if the issuance of shares of Company
Common Stock by the Company in connection with the exercise of the Top-Up
Option by Merger Sub would violate applicable Nasdaq rules, (ii) Merger Sub
shall, concurrently with the exercise of the Top-Up Option, give written
notice to the Company that as promptly as practicable following such
exercise, Merger Sub shall (and Purchaser shall cause Merger Sub to)
consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the Delaware GCL as
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) the Top-Up Option may not be
exercised if

        

any provision of applicable law or any judgment, injunction, order or decree
of any federal, state, provincial, local and foreign government,
governmental, quasi-governmental, supranational, regulatory or administrative
authority, agency, commission or any court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral
body (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") shall prohibit, or require any
action, consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, or filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Entity or the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders in connection with the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise, which action,
consent, approval, authorization or permit, action, filing or notification
has not theretofore been obtained or made, as applicable.

  

(b) Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares may include any legends
required by applicable securities laws.

  

(c) Purchaser and Merger Sub understand that the shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not
be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for
transactions not involving a public offering. Purchaser and Merger Sub
represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act). Merger Sub agrees
that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise
thereof are being and will be acquired for the purpose of investment and not
with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof
within the meaning of the Securities Act.

SECTION 2.6. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company,
the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock, or the holder of any shares
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub
Common Stock_ "):

  

(a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to
be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_ and Dissenting Shares) or
issuable pursuant to any outstanding equity awards granted under the Option
Plans or otherwise shall be converted automatically into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock upon which the
Merger Consideration is payable pursuant to this _Section 2.6(a)_ shall no
longer be outstanding and shall

        

automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such holderÂ’s shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split,
reverse split, reclassification, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, consolidation, exchange or other like change with respect
to the Company Common Stock occurring (or having a record date) after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

  

(b) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock that

(c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Purchaser- and Merger Sub-Owned
Company Common Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by
the Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Purchaser, Merger Sub or any
subsidiary of Purchaser or Merger Sub or held in the treasury of the Company
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
cash, Company Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.

  

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and

holder who shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto
in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing an appraisal of
the "fair value" of such Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be cancelled
and terminated and shall cease to have any rights with respect to Dissenting
Shares other than such rights as are granted pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by holders of Company Common
Stock who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights for an appraisal of such shares under the DGCL
shall thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and terminated, as of the
Effective Time, and shall represent solely the right to receive the Offer
Price in accordance with _Section 2.6(a)_ upon surrender in the manner
provided in Section 2.6(f) of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock. Any payments made in respect
of Dissenting Shares shall be made in accordance with the DGCL solely by the
Surviving Corporation out of its own funds. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Purchaser and Merger Sub of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock and of attempted withdrawals of
such notice and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to stockholder rights of appraisal, and
Purchaser and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.  The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser and Merger Sub,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

(e) _Exchange Agent_. From time to time after the Effective Time, the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, when and
as required, deposit with a bank or trust company designated by Purchaser
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_
through the Exchange Agent, an amount equal to the aggregate Merger
Consideration (such consideration being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions of the Surviving Corporation, make payments of the Merger
Consideration out of the Exchange Fund.  The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose.

  

(f) _Exchange Procedure for Certificates_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Purchaser
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.6(a)_ : (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as
the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify); and (y) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the
Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ , and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions
as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of such Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.6(f)_ , each Certificate
(other than a Certificate representing shares of Company Common Stock
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration,
without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.6(a)_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the
consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate.

  

(g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All consideration
paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company

        

Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates, subject, however,
to any obligation of the Surviving Corporation to pay any dividends or make
any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that
may have been authorized or made with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock that remain unpaid or unsatisfied at the Effective Time, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, the Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article II_ , except as otherwise provided by applicable
law.

  

(h) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_  shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and
only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends or other distributions
that such holder may be due on Company Common Stock, under applicable law.

  

(i) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Merger Sub, Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director,
stockholder, agent or affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

(j) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation,
on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that
there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments
of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost
through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

  

(k) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts
as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation.

  

(l) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as
indemnity against any

        

claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

  

SECTION 2.7. _Stock Plans_.

  

(a) Not later than the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to provide that, either (i) at the Effective Time (or to the extent
practicable, immediately prior to the time (the " _Purchase Time_ ") at
which the Purchaser consummates the purchase of tendered Shares pursuant to
the Offer), each then outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Options_ ") granted under any of the CompanyÂ’s stock option
plans listed in _Section 4.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each
as amended (collectively, the " _Option Plans_ "), or granted
otherwise, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled in
exchange for the right to receive from Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the product of (x)
the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price thereof and
(y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (such
payment to be net of applicable withholding Taxes) or (ii) any Option that is
not cancelled as described in Section 2.7(a)(i) above shall represent, upon
exercise on or after the Effective Time, the right to receive Company Common
Stock which has been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

  

(b) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties and to
the extent permitted by the Option Plans, (i) the Company shall cause the
Option Plans to terminate no later than the Effective Time and, except as set
forth in _Section 2.7(c)_ , cause the provisions in any other plan, program
or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant by the Company of any
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to terminate and have no further force or effect as of the
Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall ensure that following the Effective
Time no holder of Options or any participant in the Option Plans or anyone
other than Purchaser shall hold or have any right to acquire any equity
securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof.

  

(c) Substantially concurrently with the approval of this Agreement, the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board will take any and all actions
with respect to the CompanyÂ’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")
as are necessary to provide that: (i) all offering periods under the ESPP
will be immediately suspended and any contributions made for the current
offering periods will be returned to ESPP participants, and (ii) the ESPP
will terminate, effective immediately as of the Purchase Time, except that
all administrative and other rights and authorities granted under the ESPP to
the Company, the Company Board or any committee or designee thereof shall
remain in effect and reside with the Company following the Purchase Time.

  

SECTION 2.8. _Time and Place of Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed
upon in writing by Purchaser and the Company, the closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will be held at 10:00 a.m., Austin, Texas time, on the first
business day following the date that all of the conditions precedent
specified in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver
of those conditions) have been satisfied or waived by the party or parties
permitted to do so (such date being referred to

        

hereinafter as the " _Closing Date_ "). The place of Closing shall be at the
offices of the Purchaser in Austin, Texas, or at such other place as may be
agreed between Purchaser and the Company.

  

 **ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 OF MERGER SUB AND PURCHASER**

  

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by Purchaser and
Merger Sub to the Company at or prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the " _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ "), each of Merger Sub and
Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

  

SECTION 3.1. _Organization_. Each of Merger Sub and Purchaser is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under

hereof, 100 of such shares are issued and outstanding, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned beneficially and of
record by Purchaser free and clear of any liens, security interests, pledges,
agreements, claims, charges or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever ("
_Liens_ "). There are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character obligating Merger Sub to issue

Agreement and except for this Agreement and any other agreements or

the execution and delivery of this Agreement by either Merger Sub or
Purchaser, the performance by each of Merger Sub and Purchaser of their
respective obligations hereunder and the consummation by each of Merger Sub
and Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by each of Merger Sub and Purchaser
and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of Merger Sub and Purchaser,

terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now
or hereafter in effect, relating to creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (ii)
equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion
of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

  

SECTION 3.4. _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

Purchaser does not, and the performance of this Agreement by each of Merger
Sub and Purchaser and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not, (i) subject to the requirements, filings, consents and

indenture, lease or other instrument of any kind, permit, license or
franchise to which Merger Sub or Purchaser is a party or by which either
Merger Sub or Purchaser or any of their respective property is bound
or subject except, in the case of clause (iii), for such breaches,
defaults, rights or Liens that would not materially impair the ability of
Purchaser or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(b) Except for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act, the pre-merger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "),
and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by
the DGCL, and except as set forth in _Section 3.4(b)_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub is required to submit
any notice, report or other filing with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for such of the
foregoing, including under Regulatory Laws, as are required by reason of the
legal or regulatory status or the activities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or by reason of facts specifically pertaining to any of them. No
waiver, consent, approval or authorization of any Governmental Entity is
required to be obtained or made by Purchaser or Merger Sub in connection with
their execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, except for such
of the foregoing as are required by reason of the legal or regulatory status
or the activities of the Company or its Subsidiaries or by reason of facts
specifically pertaining to any of them. For purposes of this Agreement, "

foreign statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, permit, consent, waiver,
notice, approval, registration, finding of suitability, license, judgment,
order, decree, injunction or other authorization applicable to, governing or

(c) Although Purchaser does not require the approval of its lenders under
that certain Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October
1, 2004 and as amended to date, to which the Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, are parties (" _Purchaser Â’s Bank Credit
Agreement_") to consummate the Merger, such approval would be required in
order to consummate the Offer; and Purchaser reasonably anticipates obtaining
such approval.

  

SECTION 3.5. _Financing_. Purchaser has available sufficient cash
and committed financing sources to satisfy its obligations to cause Merger
Sub to purchase and pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer and to cause the

based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of Merger Sub or Purchaser.

with the SEC and are mailed to the stockholders of the Company, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no representation is made by Purchaser or Merger Sub
with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of the
Company or any Affiliate of the Company expressly for inclusion therein. The
Offer Documents will, at the time the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC
and, at the time they are mailed to the stockholders of the Company, and at
the time any amendment or supplement thereto is filed with the SEC, comply as
to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

(b) None of the information to be supplied in writing by Merger Sub or
Purchaser specifically for inclusion in the proxy statement contemplated by
_Section 5.4_ (together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") or the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the times such documents
are filed with the SEC, and, in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the time
the Proxy Statement is mailed to stockholders and at the time of the meeting
of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders to consider the Merger Agreement (the "
_Company Stockholders Â’ Meeting_"), contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 **ARTICLE IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to
Purchaser and Merger Sub at or prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company
hereby represents and warrants on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries to
Merger Sub and Purchaser as follows:

  

SECTION 4.1. _Organization and Qualification_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has
the requisite corporate power and authority necessary to own,
possess, license, operate or lease the properties that it purports to own,
possess, license, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing,
in each jurisdiction where its business or the character of its properties
owned, possessed, licensed, operated or leased, or the nature of its
activities, makes such qualification necessary, except for such failure
which, when taken together with all other such failures, would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any effect, change, fact,
event, development, occurrence or circumstance that, individually or together
with any other effect, change, fact, event, development, occurrence or
circumstance, (A) is materially adverse to the condition (financial or
otherwise), properties, business, operations, results of operations, assets
or liabilities of the Company and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or (B) materially and adversely effects the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall any of the following, either alone or in combination, be deemed to
constitute, nor shall any of the following be taken into account in
determining whether there has been a Material Adverse Effect: (A)
any changes resulting from or arising out of general market, economic or
political conditions, provided that such changes do not have a
substantially disproportionate impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (B) any changes resulting from or arising out of general
market, economic or political conditions in the industry in which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries conduct business, provided that such changes do

SECTION 5.2. _No Solicitations_.

  

(a) The Company shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly
or indirectly, through any officer, director, affiliate, employee, agent,
financial advisor, representative or otherwise, (a) solicit or initiate any
inquiries with respect to the submission of any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined below), (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding,
or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist or participate in, facilitate
or encourage, any effort or attempt by any Person to make an inquiry in
respect of or make any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may
be reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or (c)
enter into any agreement or agreement in principle providing for or relating
to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may, prior to the purchase of the Shares pursuant to the Offer, in response
to an unsolicited bona fide written proposal received on or after the date of
this Agreement (and not withdrawn), with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
from a third party, which did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.2_
, furnish information to, and negotiate, explore or otherwise engage
in substantive discussions with such third party only if, and only to the
extent that (i) the Company Board, after consultation with and taking into
account the advice of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that the Company Board would reasonably be likely to
breach its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law without
taking such action (ii) prior to taking such action, the Company receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement having terms no more
favorable than the Confidentiality Agreement, (iii) the Company promptly
provides to the Purchaser any non-public information that is provided to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal or its representatives which was not
previously provided to the Purchaser or Merger Sub, (iv) the Company Board,
after consultation with and taking into account the advice of its financial
advisors and legal counsel, determines in good faith that such proposal
would, if accepted, be reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal, and (v) the proposal would, if consummated,
result in a transaction that is more favorable to Company Stockholders, from
a financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (such more favorable Acquisition Proposal hereinafter referred to
as a " _Superior Proposal_ "; _provided_ , that for purposes of the
definition of Superior Proposal, the term Acquisition Proposal shall have the
meaning assigned below, except that references to "15% or more" shall be
deemed to be references to "50% or more").

  

(b) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors, affiliates, employees, agents, financial advisors and
representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to the possibility or consideration of any
Acquisition Proposal.

  

(c) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to notify Purchaser
and Merger Sub promptly (but in no event later than one business day) if any
proposals are received by, any information is requested from, or any
negotiations or discussions are sought to be

        

initiated or continued with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal.  Each notice shall contain
the name of any Person making any such proposal, requesting such information
or seeking such negotiations or discussions and a summary of the material
terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and thereafter the Company
shall keep Purchaser and Merger Sub informed, on a current basis, of the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

  

(d) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to promptly request
each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of acquiring the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to promptly return or destroy all written confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person (whether then in the
possession of such Person or its advisors or representatives) by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company agrees not to release
any third party from or waive any provisions of confidentiality in any
confidentiality agreement to which the Company is a party or by which it is
bound.

  

(e) The Company shall not take any action to (i) exempt any Person (other
than Merger Sub, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates) from the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
(or any similar provision of any other Law) or otherwise cause such
restrictions not to apply, (ii) exempt any Person (other than Merger Sub,
Purchaser and their respective Affiliates) from the provisions on "control
share acquisitions" contained in any Takeover Statute or otherwise cause such
restrictions not to apply, or (iii) amend or waive the Rights Agreement or
redeem the Rights, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless
such actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_.

  

(f) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any willful
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.2_ by any officer,
director, affiliate, employee, agent, financial advisor or representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 5.2_.

  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal, offer or indication of interest from any Person (other
than by or on behalf of Merger Sub or Purchaser) relating to any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase (including any single or multiple-step
transaction) of a business or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries that
constitutes a substantial portion of the net revenues, net income or assets
of the Company or any of its "significant subsidiaries" (as defined in Rule
1-02 under Regulation S-X of the Securities Act) (a "
_Significant Subsidiary_ "), or 15% or more beneficial ownership (as
determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of any class of
equity securities of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning (as determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act) 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and any transaction by the Company permitted by Section 5.1 hereof.

        



  

SECTION 5.3. _Fiduciary Duties_.

  

(a) The Company Board shall not (a) except as set forth in this Section 5.3
or required by Rule 14(e)-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, withdraw or
modify or change in a manner adverse to Purchaser and Merger Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation, or (b) except as set forth in this Section 5.3,
approve, recommend or cause the Company to enter into any written agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if,
at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the Purchase Time or (ii) Company
StockholdersÂ’ Meeting, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with and taking into account the advice of its financial
advisors and legal counsel) that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal (for which, in the case of this Section 5.3(a) only, financing, to
the extent required, is then represented by a bona fide commitment letter),
the Company Board may withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in
response to such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 7.3(b)_ , but only if the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with and taking into account the advice of its
financial advisor and legal counsel) that the Company Board would breach its
fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law without taking such
action; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking such action, the
Company Board shall have (1) given Purchaser and Merger Sub at least five
business days prior written notice that the Company intends to take such
action and provided Purchaser and Merger Sub with a reasonable opportunity to
respond to any such Superior Proposal (which response could include a
proposal to revise the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby) and (2)
fully considered any such response by Purchaser and Merger Sub and concluded
that, notwithstanding such response, such Acquisition Proposal continues to
be a Superior Proposal in relation to the transactions contemplated hereby,
as the terms hereof may be proposed to be revised by such response; and
_provided further_ , that any such termination of this Agreement shall be
void and of no force or effect, unless substantially concurrently with such
termination the Company pays Purchaser the fee required by _Section 7.5(b)_.

  

(b) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or from making any other disclosure (including a withdrawal or modification
of the Company Board Recommendation) if the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , that any disclosure other
than (i) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express
rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) an express
reaffirmation of its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Offer
and the Merger, shall be deemed to be a withdrawal of the Company Board
Recommendation.

  

SECTION 5.4. _Proxy Statement_. As soon as practicable after (i) the
Purchase Time, unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section
253 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 5.5(b)_ , or (ii) a termination
or expiration of the Offer that does not result in the termination of
this Agreement, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement in connection with the Merger.  Purchaser and Merger Sub
will cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation of the
Proxy Statement including,

        

but not limited to, furnishing to the Company any and all information
regarding Purchaser, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates as may be
required to be disclosed therein. The Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any other comments made by Purchaser and Merger Sub
and their counsel. The Company agrees (i) to provide Purchaser and Merger Sub
with any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that may
be received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement
promptly upon receipt thereof and prior to responding thereto and (ii) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of the Company to those
comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and
good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with the
Company or their counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.  The
Proxy Statement shall contain the recommendation of the Company Board that
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. As promptly as possible after clearance by the SEC of
the Proxy Statement, the Company will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to its stockholders.

  

SECTION 5.5. _Meeting of Stockholders of the Company_.

  

(a) Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the
DGCL as contemplated by _Section 5.5(b)_, the Company shall promptly take
all action necessary in accordance with applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Company to convene the Company
StockholdersÂ’ Meeting.  The stockholder vote or consent required for approval
of the Merger will be no greater than that set forth in the DGCL.  The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit from stockholders of the
Company proxies in favor of the Merger and shall take all other
action necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of Merger Sub, advisable to
secure any vote or consent of stockholders required by the DGCL to effect the
Merger. Merger Sub and Purchaser each agree that, at the Company
StockholdersÂ’ Meeting, all of the Shares acquired pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise owned by Merger Sub or Purchaser or any of their direct or indirect
Subsidiaries will be voted in favor of the Merger.

  

(b) If, following the Offer and any subsequent offering period or the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub, Purchaser, or any other direct or
indirect Subsidiary of Purchaser, shall hold at least 90 percent of the
outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company, each of
Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company shall (subject to _Section 6.1_) take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective,
as soon as practicable after the Purchase Time, without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

  

SECTION 5.6. _Additional Agreements_. The Company, Merger Sub and Purchaser
will each comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and with
all applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity in connection
with its execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

SECTION 5.7. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Purchaser, and Merger Sub and Purchaser and Merger Sub shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any fact, event or circumstance whose occurrence or nonoccurrence would be
likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date

        

hereof to the Effective Time, (b) any material failure of the Company or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, or any officer, director, employee or agent
thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder and (c) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any fact, event or circumstance which has or is reasonably
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

  

SECTION 5.8. _Access to Information_.

  

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, directors,

advisors, representatives and agents of Purchaser and Merger Sub reasonable
access during normal business hours to its officers, employees,
representatives, agents, properties, offices and other facilities and to all
information systems, contracts, books and records (including Tax Returns,
audit work papers and insurance policies, but excluding privileged documents
or documents or information the disclosure of which is not permitted by
applicable law or order of any Governmental Entity in accordance with
the written opinion of the CompanyÂ’s counsel, after consultation with counsel
for the Purchaser as to the nature of such excluded information), and shall
furnish Purchaser and Merger Sub with all financial, operating and other data
and information that Purchaser and Merger Sub, through their officers,
employees, consultants or agents, may reasonably request.  No information
received pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ shall affect or be deemed to modify
or update any representation or warranty of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contained in this Agreement.

  

(b) Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub agrees that it shall, and shall direct
its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
financial advisors, consultants and agents, to hold in strict confidence all
data and information obtained by them from the Company in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution an delivery of
this Agreement and any termination hereof pursuant to _Article VII_.

  

SECTION 5.9. _Public Announcements_. Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements or announcements with respect to the Merger and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
before such consultation, except as may be required by applicable law or
stock exchange rules, in which case the party desiring to make a public
statement or disclosure shall consult with the other parties and permit them
opportunity to review and comment on the proposed disclosure to the extent
practicable under the circumstances.

  

SECTION 5.10. _Approval and Consents; Cooperation_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the

cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, that nothing in this _Section 5.10_ shall require
Merger Sub or Purchaser to

        

keep the Offer open beyond the expiration date set forth in the Offer (as it
may be extended from time to time). In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, (i) to the extent required under the HSR Act, each party

practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and (iii) subject to _Section 5.10(e)_ , to
take all other reasonable actions necessary, proper or advisable to (x) avoid
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing
to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (y) cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, including by
requesting early termination of the waiting period provided for in the HSR
Act.

  

(b) Each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry (including any proceeding initiated by a private party), (ii)
promptly inform the other party to this Agreement of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ "), the Federal Trade
Commission (" _FTC_ "), or any other Governmental Entity, and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, any such Governmental Entity or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity or other person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

  

(c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or if any suit is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable
Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act or which would otherwise
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Merger Sub, Purchaser and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such
objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections
or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Merger
Sub, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each
other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist
any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

        



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement
the parties hereto understand and agree that the reasonable best efforts of
any party hereto, shall not obligate Merger Sub, Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates to divest or otherwise hold separate (including by
establishing a trust or otherwise), or take any other action (or otherwise
agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to (i) any business, asset
or property that was owned by the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) the Surviving CorporationÂ’s businesses, assets or
properties other than those stores set forth on that certain letter agreement
between the Purchaser and the Company, dated even date herewith and relating
to this _Section 5.10_.

  

(f) The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
any other consents of third parties which are disclosed as being required
under _Section 4.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "
_Required Approvals_ ") for the purposes of consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall reasonably cooperate and consult with one
another with respect to such efforts;  _provided_ , that this _Section
5.10(f)_ shall not require any party to pay any consideration (other than
customary attorneysÂ’ fees and nominal transfer or review fees) in order to
obtain such consents.

  

SECTION 5.11. _Further Assurances_. Subject to _Section 5.10_ , in case
at any time after the Effective Time any further action is reasonably
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the proper officers of the Company, Purchaser
and the Surviving Corporation shall take any such reasonably necessary
action.

  

SECTION 5.12. _Agreement to Defend and Indemnify_.

  

(a) If any action, suit, proceeding or investigation relating hereto or to
the transactions contemplated hereby is commenced (by a Person other than a
party hereto or an Affiliate of such party), whether before or after the
Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. Purchaser
shall (and shall cause Merger Sub and its Subsidiaries to) indemnify and hold
harmless, each present and former director and officer of the Company
including, without limitation, officers and directors serving as such on the
date hereof and each person who becomes prior to the Effective Time an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or
any other applicable law or provided under the CompanyÂ’s Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws in effect on the date hereof; provided that (i)
such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation required to be
imposed from time to time by applicable law; (ii) in connection with any
claim as to which indemnification is sought, neither the Company nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and(iii)
neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obliged pursuant
to this _Section 5.12_ to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single action except to the extent
that, in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Parties, two or more of
such Indemnified Parties have an actual conflict of interest in the outcome
of such action.

        



  

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
all indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and an Indemnified Party.
 In addition, for a period of six years following the Effective
Time, Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification and
exculpation provisions contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and By-
Laws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six
year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any respect, except as required by applicable laws.

  

(c) In the event that the Company fails to procure the "tail" policy referred
to in clause (d) below, for six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to maintain or obtain officersÂ’ and directorsÂ’
liability insurance covering the Indemnified Parties on terms and conditions
not less favorable than those in effect on the date hereof in terms of
coverage and amounts; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than a cumulative amount for
such insurance in excess of 300% of the premium set forth in _Section 5.12_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule to maintain or procure insurance coverage
pursuant hereto, in which case the Surviving Corporation shall provide the
greatest coverage that is then available for 300% of such annual premium.

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable efforts, in
consultation with the Purchaser, to purchase tail policies to the current
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policies maintained on the date
of this Agreement by the Company, which tail policies (i) shall not have an
aggregate premium in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium most
recently paid by the Company prior to the date hereof to maintain the
existing policies (which amount is set forth in _Section 5.12_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule), (ii) shall be effective with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the
Effective Time, and (iii) shall contain coverage that is at least
as protective to such directors and officers as the coverage provided by
such existing policies (complete and accurate copies of which have been
made available to the Purchaser); _provided_ , _however_ , that,
if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying
an aggregate premium in excess of 300% of such amount, the Company shall only
be required to obtain (and the Surviving Corporation shall only be required
to maintain) as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an aggregate

agreements hereunder, which breach or failure to perform would cause the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ to not be
satisfied, and such breach or failure to perform is not curable or, if
curable, is not cured within 30 days of written notice thereof delivered to

Company or publicly announced and, in each case, not irrevocably withdrawn,
or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not

not occurring prior to the Outside Date or (ii) _Section 7.4_ , then, in
any such case, the Company shall pay the Purchaser a termination fee of

such case, the Company shall pay the Purchaser a termination fee of
$15,200,000 within one business day following the termination of this
Agreement, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to such account or
accounts as the Purchaser may designate in writing to the Company.

no amendment shall be made which decreases the Merger Consideration,
and (ii) after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the

requires the further approval of the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by the parties hereto.

  

SECTION 7.7. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may to the extent legally allowed (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii)
waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein, except that the Minimum Tender Condition may
only be waived by Purchaser with the prior written consent of the Company.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in

 **Exhibit A**

  

 ** _CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_**

  

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement to which it is
attached (the " _Merger Agreement_ ").

  

1. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger SubÂ’s obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered in connection with the Offer and, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, may terminate or amend the Offer, unless, immediately prior to the Expiration Date:

  

(a) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn that number of shares of Company Common Stock (including the shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Support Agreement), which, together
with the number of Shares, if any, then owned beneficially by Purchaser,
Merger Sub and any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Purchaser or Merger Sub, taken
as a whole, constitutes at least a majority of the total number of then-
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (which
shall mean, as of any time, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding, together with all shares of Company Common Stock (if any) which
the Company would be required to issue pursuant to any then outstanding
warrants, options, benefit plans or obligations or securities convertible or
exchangeable into shares of Company Common Stock or otherwise, but only to
the extent then exercisable, other than potential dilution attributable to
the Rights on the date shares of Company Common Stock are accepted for
payment (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ "); and

  

(b) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if any, shall have expired or
been terminated.

  

2. Additionally, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger SubÂ’s obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered in connection with the Offer and, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, including _Section 1.1_, may terminate or amend the Offer if any of the following conditions exist:

  

(a) there shall have been any law, decree, judgment, order or injunction,
promulgated, enacted, entered, enforced, issued or amended by any
Governmental Entity that would directly or indirectly (i) restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger;
(ii) impose material limitations on the ability

        

of Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to acquire or hold, transfer or dispose of, or effectively
to exercise all rights of ownership of, some or all of the shares of
Company Common Stock, including the right to vote the shares of Company
Common Stock purchased by it pursuant to the Offer on an equal basis with all
other shares of Company Common Stock on all matters properly presented to the
stockholders of the Company; or (iii) require, or condition any approval on,
the divestiture by Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any shares of Company Common Stock, or require
Merger Sub, Purchaser, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to take, or condition any approval on, any action referred to
in clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 5.10(e)_ of the Merger Agreement, except
as expressly provided therein;

  

(b) there shall be pending, any action, proceeding or counterclaim by any
Governmental Entity challenging the making or consummation of the Offer or
the Merger or seeking, directly or indirectly, to result in any of the
consequences referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) of Paragraph 2(a)
above;

  

(c) any change, event or circumstance has occurred since the date hereof that
has a Material Adverse Effect;

  

(d) (i) the Company shall have materially breached or failed to comply in any
material respect with any of its agreements contained in the Merger Agreement
or (ii) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in the
Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct except for such breaches
of representations and warranties that have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect as of any scheduled expiration of the Offer (except for any
representation or warranty that is expressly made as of a specified date, in
which case as of such specified date);

  

(e) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms or
shall have been amended pursuant to its terms to provide for such termination
or amendment of the Offer; which, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser or
Merger Sub, in any case, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or
with acceptance for payment or payment for Shares; or

  

(f) the Purchaser shall not have received the required approval under the
PurchaserÂ’s Bank Credit Agreement to consummate the Offer.

  

The conditions set forth in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this _Exhibit A_ are for
the benefit of Purchaser and Merger Sub and, regardless of the circumstances,
may be asserted by Purchaser or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any
applicable time or from time to time prior to the Expiration Date, except
that the conditions relating to receipt of any approvals from any
Governmental Entity may be asserted at any time prior to the acceptance for
payment of Shares, and all conditions (except for the Minimum Tender
Condition) may be waived by Purchaser or Merger Sub in its discretion in
whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time, in each case
subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure of Purchaser or
Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of

        

the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.
