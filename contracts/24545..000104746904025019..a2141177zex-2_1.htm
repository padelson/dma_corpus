ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Matters. _ 

  

    
 (a) _ Confidentiality. _ The parties acknowledge that Molson and Coors have previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 11, 2004 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

    
 (b) _ Access to Information. _ Each of Coors and Molson will (and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford the other party and its accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to its properties, books, records, Contracts and personnel during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its business, properties, results of operations and personnel, as may be reasonably requested. No information or knowledge obtained by any party in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any Law (including Laws relating to the exchange of information and all applicable antitrust, competition and similar Laws, and attorney-client and other privileges) applicable to such party requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit such access. The parties will hold any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) in confidence in accordance with, and otherwise subject to, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

    
 (c) _ Post-Effective Time Covenants. _ Following the Effective Time and while any Exchangeable Shares (other than any Exchangeable Shares owned by Coors or any of its Affiliates) are outstanding, (a) Coors will use its best efforts to ensure that Exchangeco (or any successor thereto as the issuer of the Exchangeable Shares) will continue to be a "taxable Canadian corporation" and a "public corporation" within the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definitions which are consistent with the general principle thereof), and (b) Coors will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Exchangeable Shares are listed on a "prescribed stock exchange in Canada" within the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof). This covenant shall survive the Effective Time. 

  

    
 (d) _ Tax-Deferred Transaction. _ None of Coors, Callco or Exchangeco shall take any action which could reasonably be expected to prevent the exchange of Molson Common Shares for consideration that includes Exchangeable Shares under the Arrangement by the validly-electing Canadian resident holders of Molson Common Shares who make and file a valid tax election under subsection 85(1) or (2) of the ITA as described and on the terms set forth in the Plan of Arrangement from being treated as a tax deferred transaction for purposes of the ITA if such holders are otherwise eligible for such treatment. 

  

    
 (e) _ Substantial Presence. _ As long as there are any Exchangeable Shares outstanding (other than Exchangeable Shares held by Coors or any of its Affiliates), and if required to cause Exchangeable Shares not to be "foreign property" within the meaning of subsection 206(1) of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof), Coors shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Exchangeco to maintain a substantial presence in Canada for purposes of subsection 206(1.1) of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such concept which are consistent with the general principle thereof). This covenant shall survive the Effective Time. 

  

    
 (f) _ Safe Income. _ (i) Molson Shareholders will be permitted to effect a "safe income tuck-in" transaction (a " _Safe-Income Transaction_ ") in accordance with applicable Laws to be effective shortly 

        

prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the terms and
subject to the conditions described in the holding company participation
agreement attached as Exhibit F hereto.

  

  

 (ii) In the event that (i) the terms and conditions of such Safe Income Transaction are not satisfactory to the Director or the Court or (ii) the Ontario Securities Commission, the AMF or any other securities regulatory authority in Canada refuses to grant any relief required in connection with any such transaction, then Coors will use its reasonable best efforts to assist Molson in structuring an alternate form of Safe Income Transaction in a manner satisfactory to each of Coors and Molson, acting reasonably, as well as to the Ontario Securities Commission, the AMF or any other securities regulatory authority in Canada. 

  

  

    
 (g) _ Tax Status. _ 

  

  

 (i) Coors covenants that it will take all steps reasonably within its control that are necessary to ensure that it will not become a "United States real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. This covenant shall survive the Effective Time. 

  

 (ii) Coors covenants that, so long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares are owned by any Original Significant Exchangeable Shareholder, it will take all steps within its control that are necessary to ensure that it will not become a "specified financial institution" within the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof). This covenant shall survive the Effective Time. This covenant will not prevent Coors or any of its Affiliates from effecting an acquisition of or merger or combination with another corporation where (a) each Original Significant Exchangeable Shareholder consents in writing to such merger or acquisition, (b) Coors indemnifies each Original Significant Exchangeable Shareholder on an after-tax basis for any losses arising from Coors becoming a "specified financial institution" within the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof), or (c) Coors ensures that it is not a "specified financial institution" within the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof) from and after the earlier of (i) 60 days following the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to such merger, combination or acquisition, and (ii) the date of payment of the first dividend on the Exchangeable Shares following the entering into of such definitive agreement. For the purpose of the foregoing, an "Original Significant Exchangeable Shareholder" is a shareholder who (i) pursuant to the Arrangement, received, and (ii) at any subsequent time when its status as an Original Significant Exchangeable Shareholder is being determined, holds, more than 10% of the shares of any class of Exchangeable Shares, and all of the Exchangeable Shares owned by (1) such Person, (2) any other Person with whom the shareholder does not deal at arm\'s length for purposes of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof) and (3) any trust of which the shareholder is a beneficiary, have an aggregate fair market value of at least $25,000,000. This covenant does not apply to the extent of a breach of the representation of Molson regarding its status as a "specified financial institution" as at the Effective Time. 

  

 (iii) Coors covenants that, so long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares or Coors Stock are owned by any Original Significant Canadian Shareholder, it will take all steps within its control that are necessary to ensure that it will not become a "foreign investment entity" within the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time (assuming the enactment into law and the proclamation into force of proposed sections 94.1 to 94.4 and related provisions as contained in the October 30, 2003 Notice of Ways and Means Motion) and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof). This covenant shall survive the Effective Time. This covenant will not prevent Coors or any of its Affiliates from undertaking any business or activity where each Original Significant Canadian Shareholder consents in writing to such 

  

      

  
  

business or activity. For the purpose of the foregoing, an "Original
Significant Canadian Shareholder" is a shareholder who (i) pursuant to the
Arrangement, received, and (ii) at any subsequent time when its status as an
Original Significant Canadian Shareholder is being determined, holds, more
than 10% of the shares of any class of Exchangeable Shares or Coors Stock
(including for this purpose any shares held by a Person with whom the
shareholder does not deal at arm\'s length for purposes of the ITA (as of the
Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent
with the general principle thereof)) or any shares of any class of
Exchangeable Shares or Coors Stock in which there are fewer than 150 holders
each holding Cdn. $500 worth of shares.

  

  

    
 (h) _ Withholding Taxes. _ Exchangeco covenants that it will pay additional amounts with respect to any dividends paid to a Canadian resident holder of Exchangeable Shares in the event that any withholding taxes other than Canadian Federal or Provincial taxes withheld at source (" _non-Canadian withholding taxes_ ") are imposed, directly or indirectly, in respect of such dividends. Such additional amounts shall be determined such that, on an after-tax basis, the Canadian resident holder has received the same amount that it would have received if no non-Canadian withholding taxes had been imposed, taking into account any increased (x) gross income tax imposed directly on such holder by the jurisdiction imposing such non-Canadian withholding taxes, (y) non-Canadian withholding tax and (z) Canadian income tax, in each case, in respect of such additional amounts after any reductions of income, credits or deductions available to such holder arising as a result of such non-Canadian withholding taxes or any payments made under this Section 6.1(h) (and only to the extent a net increase in tax is reasonably demonstrated by such holder). If gross income tax in the jurisdiction imposing such non-Canadian withholding taxes is paid directly by a Canadian resident holder of Exchangeable Shares with respect to dividends on such Exchangeable Shares or any payments made under this Section 6.1(h), Exchangeco shall make a tax reimbursement payment to the Canadian resident holder of the Exchangeable Shares for any such taxes (whether such taxes are actually withheld, paid by reason of notice received from a taxing authority or otherwise) not covered by additional amounts described above (and computed by treating the tax reimbursement payment for purposes of this section as an additional amount to which this section applies). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such additional amounts and tax reimbursement payments will not apply to the extent non-Canadian withholding taxes are imposed at a rate in excess of the withholding tax rate applicable to payments of dividends to individuals under the income tax treaty between the United States and Canada, or any successor treaty. Without limiting a Canadian resident holder\'s obligation to reasonably demonstrate a net increase in taxes imposed as described above, nothing contained herein shall require any Canadian resident holder of the Exchangeable Shares to disclose any confidential or propriety information (including, without limitation, its tax return). In no event shall anything in this Section 6.1(h) require any Canadian resident holder of the Exchangeable Shares to arrange its tax affairs in any particular manner.

 6.2 _ No Solicitation. _ 

   

 (a) Each of Molson and Coors agrees that it shall not, and it shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of it or its Subsidiaries to, and that it shall direct and cause its and its Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making by any third party (other than the other party hereto and/or its Subsidiaries) of any proposal or offer with respect to a purchase, merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement, business combination, liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or similar transaction involving any material portion of the consolidated assets of Molson or Coors or any shares of any class of equity securities of Molson or Coors (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"). Each of Molson and Coors further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and cause its and its Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) execute or enter into, or publicly propose to accept or enter into an agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, including a letter of intent, agreement in principle, option agreement, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other agreement in furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal.

any agreement referred to in clause (iii) of Section 6.2(a) with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) in the case of Coors, concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement by Coors pursuant to Section 8.1(k) and
following payment by Coors of the Termination Fee to Molson pursuant to
Section 8.3(c)(iv), entering into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement referred to in clause (iii) of Section
6.2(a) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent
that:

  

  

 (i) in each such case referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D), (1) the Molson Shareholder Approval or the Coors Stockholder Approval, as applicable, has not yet been obtained, and (2) the board of directors of Molson or Coors, as the case may be, determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take the foregoing action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (including, without limitation, the duty of care); 

  

 (ii) in each case referred to in clause (B) or (D) above, the board of directors of Molson or Coors, as the case may be, determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal; and 

  

 (iii) in the case referred to in clause (E) above, prior to Molson or Coors, as the case may be, effecting a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.1(j) or 8.1(k), as applicable, (1) the Molson Shareholder Approval or the Coors Stockholder Approval, as applicable, shall not have been obtained, (2) such party shall be in compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.2, (3) the board of directors of such party shall have determined in good faith, and, in the case of Molson, after considering the recommendation of the Independent Committee, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by the other party pursuant to clause (5) below; (4) such party shall have notified the other party in writing, at least five days in advance of termination that it is considering terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(j) or (k), as applicable, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and delivering the documents and information required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(c); and (5) during such five-day period, such party shall have negotiated, and shall have made its financial and legal advisors available to negotiate, with the other party should the other party elect to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that, after giving effect thereto, such Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal. As used herein, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal with respect to a party that the board of directors of such party concludes in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, is (i) more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders or shareholders, as the case may be, of the party receiving the proposal and (ii) fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed, reasonably likely to receive all Approvals on a timely basis and otherwise reasonably capable of being completed on a timely basis; _provided_ that for purposes of this definition, "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth above, except that the references in the definition thereof to "any shares" shall be deemed to be references to "a majority of all outstanding shares of each class" and references to "any material portion" shall be deemed to be references to "all or substantially all". 

  

  

 (c) Each of Molson and Coors shall notify Coors, in the case of Molson, and Molson, in the case of Coors, promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and providing, within one business day of receipt thereof, a copy of all documentation setting forth the 

        

terms of any such inquiry, proposal or offer, and thereafter shall keep
Coors, in the case of Molson, and Molson, in the case of Coors, informed, on a
current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and
the status of any such discussions or negotiations (including by delivering
any further documentation of the type referred to above).

  

 (d) Each of Molson and Coors shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Each of Coors and Molson shall promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Coors nor Molson shall terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or standstill or similar agreement to which Molson, Coors or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party. 

  

 (e) Each of Molson and Coors shall take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2. 

  

    
 6.3 _ Public Announcements. _ Coors and Molson shall use reasonable best efforts (i) to develop a joint communications plan, (ii) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be consistent with such joint communications plan, and (iii) except in respect of any announcement required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

to the extent relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(C) receiving the prior written consent of the other party before agreeing to

(including interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys\' and experts\' fees
and disbursements) which are made against or incurred by such holders of
Exchangeable Shares in their capacity as shareholders of Exchangeco primarily

vehicle.

  

    
 6.15 _ Pre-Arrangement Transactions. _ Subject to Sections 6.1(c) through (f) and the conditions to closing, Molson and Coors shall each cooperate in good faith to plan and implement transactions that will be beneficial to Molson and Coors after the Effective Time. 

  

    
 6.16 _ U.S. Tax Treatment. _ Molson and Coors intend for the acquisition by Exchangeco of Molson Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement (i) to be treated as a taxable acquisition of the assets of Molson for U.S. federal income tax purposes (whether as a result of an election under section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the acquisition of Molson Common Shares or otherwise) and (ii) to result in amortization and depreciation deductions with respect to Molson\'s tangible and intangible assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In the event the parties so agree on the terms of such voting trust agreement, the Family Holders of Molson and Coors shall enter into such voting trust agreement in lieu of the Family 

        

Holders of Molson depositing their shares of Class A Common Stock into the
Class A Coors Voting Trust Agreement.

(h)

 each Molson Option shall be exchanged with Coors for an option (a "Replacement Option") to purchase a number of shares of Coors Class B Common Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of Molson Class A Shares subject to such Molson Option. Such Replacement Option shall provide for an exercise price per share of Coors Class B Common Stock equal to the exercise price per share of such Molson Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. If the foregoing calculation results in a Replacement Option being exercisable for a fraction of a share of Coors Class B Common Stock, then the number of shares of Coors Class B Common Stock subject to such Replacement Option shall be rounded down to the next whole number of Coors Class B Common Stock and the total exercise price for the Replacement Option will be reduced by the exercise price of the fractional share of Coors Class B Common Stock. Subject to Appendix III hereto, the term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, and all other terms and conditions of such Replacement Option will otherwise be unchanged, and any document or agreement previously evidencing an Molson Option shall thereafter evidence and be deemed to evidence such Replacement Option. 
 

  

 At the Listing Time, the holder of each outstanding Class A Preferred Share will transfer each such share to Callco in exchange for one fully paid and non-assessable share of Coors Class A Common Stock, and the holder of each outstanding Class B1 Preferred Share and each outstanding Class B2 Preferred Share will transfer each such share to Callco in exchange for one fully paid and non-assessable share of Coors Class B Common Stock as the aggregate consideration receivable for one Class B1 Preferred Share plus one Class B2 Preferred Share. The names of the holders of the Preferred Shares transferred to Callco in exchange for Coors Common Stock shall be removed from the applicable register of holders of each class of Preferred Shares and added to the applicable register of holders of the appropriate class of Coors Common Stock, and Callco shall be recorded as the registered holder of the Preferred Shares so exchanged and shall be deemed to be legal and beneficial owner thereof. 

  

2.3 Elections

  

 Each beneficial owner of Molson Shares who is a Canadian Resident, (other than any such holder who is exempt from tax under the ITA), and who has validly elected (or for whom the holder has 

        
  

validly elected on such beneficial owner\'s behalf) to receive consideration
that includes Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled to make an income tax
election pursuant to subsection 85(1) of the ITA or, if the beneficial owner
is a partnership, subsection 85(2) of the ITA (and in each case, where
applicable, the corresponding provisions of any applicable income tax
legislation) with respect to the transfer of its Molson Shares to Exchangeco
by providing two signed copies of the necessary prescribed election form(s) to
the Depositary within 90 days following the Effective Date, duly completed
with the details of the number and class of Molson Shares transferred and the
allocation of any Preferred Share received as consideration to the shares so
transferred and the applicable agreed amounts (which, in respect of the
transfer of Molson Class A Shares or Molson Class B Shares, cannot be less
than the fair market value of the Preferred Shares allocated to such shares)
for the purposes of such elections. Thereafter, subject to the election
form(s) being correct and complete and complying with the provisions of the
ITA (or the corresponding provisions of any applicable provincial income tax
legislation), the form(s) will be signed by Exchangeco and returned to such
beneficial owner of Molson Shares within 60 days after the receipt thereof by
the Depositary for filing with the Canada Revenue Agency (or the applicable
provincial taxing authority) by such beneficial owner. Exchangeco will not be
responsible for the proper completion of any election form and, except for
Exchangeco\'s obligation to sign and return duly completed election form(s)
which are received by the Depositary within 90 days of the Effective Date,
within 60 days after the receipt thereof by the Depositary, Exchangeco will
not be responsible for any taxes, interest or penalties resulting from the
failure by a beneficial owner of Molson Shares to properly complete or file
the election form(s) in the form and manner and within the time prescribed by
the ITA (or any applicable provincial income tax legislation). In its sole
discretion, Exchangeco may choose to sign and return an election form
received by the Depositary more than 90 days following the Effective Date, but
Exchangeco will have no obligation to do so. References in this Section to
the ITA are to the ITA as of the date hereof and any modifications thereof
which are consistent with the general principle thereof.

   

2.4 Adjustments to Exchange Ratios

  

 The Exchange Ratios shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Coors Common Stock or Molson Shares other than stock dividends paid in lieu of ordinary course dividends), consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Coors Common Stock or Molson Shares occurring after the date of the Combination Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Molson Shares that were exchanged for Exchangeable Shares under the Arrangement, together with such other documents and instruments as would have been required to effect the transfer of the shares formerly represented by such certificate under the CBCA and the by-laws of Molson, and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, a certificate representing that number (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of the appropriate class of Exchangeable Shares which such holder has the right to receive (together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to section 4.3 and any cash in lieu of fractional Exchangeable Shares pursuant to section 4.4, in each case less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7 hereof), and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Molson Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Molson, a certificate representing the proper number of Exchangeable Shares may be issued to the transferee if the certificate representing such Molson Shares is presented to the Depositary, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer. Until surrendered as contemplated by this section 4.1, each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Molson Shares that were exchanged for Exchangeable Shares shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (i) the certificate representing Exchangeable Shares as contemplated by this section 4.1, (ii) a cash payment in lieu of any fractional Exchangeable Shares as contemplated by section 4.4 and (iii) any dividends or distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid or payable with respect to Exchangeable Shares as contemplated by section 4.3, in each case less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7. 

  

4.2 Certificates Representing Preferred Shares and Coors Common Stock

  

 At or promptly after the Effective Time, Exchangeco shall deposit with the Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of Molson Shares who will receive Preferred Shares in connection with the Arrangement, global certificates representing that number of whole Class A Preferred Shares and that number of whole Class B1 Preferred Shares and Class B2 Preferred Shares to be delivered to holders of Molson Shares pursuant to section 2.2 upon the exchange of Molson Shares. At or promptly after the Listing Time, (i) the Depositary (on behalf of the holders of such Preferred Shares) will deliver such global certificates to Callco, (ii) the Depository (on behalf of Exchangeco) will cancel such global 

        
  

certificates and deliver to Callco new certificates representing that number
of Class A Preferred Shares and that number of Class B1 Preferred Shares and
Class B2 Preferred Shares transferred by former holders of Molson Shares to
Callco pursuant to section 2.2, and (iii) Callco shall deposit (or shall cause
Coors to deposit) with the Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of
Class A Preferred Shares, Class B1 Preferred Shares and Class B2 Preferred
Shares that are transferred to Callco for Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors
Class B Common Stock in connection with the Arrangement, certificates
representing that number of whole shares of Coors Class A Common Stock and
that number of whole shares of Coors Class B Common Stock to be delivered
pursuant to section 2.2 upon the exchange of Preferred Shares for Coors Common
Stock. Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Molson
Shares that were exchanged for Preferred Shares that were in turn exchanged
for shares of Coors Common Stock under the Arrangement, together with
such other documents and instruments as would have been required to effect
the transfer of the shares formerly represented by such certificate under the
CBCA and the Articles and by-laws of Molson, and such additional documents
and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such
surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore,
and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, a certificate representing
that number of shares of the appropriate class of Coors Common Stock which
such holder has the right to receive in exchange for Preferred Shares
(together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to
section 4.3 and any cash in lieu of fractional Preferred Shares pursuant to
section 4.4), and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Molson Shares which is
not registered in the transfer records of Molson, a certificate representing
the proper number of shares of Coors Common Stock may be issued to the
transferee if the certificate representing such Molson Shares is presented to
the Depositary, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer. Until surrendered as contemplated by this section 4.2, each
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one
or more outstanding Molson Shares that were exchanged for Preferred Shares
that were in turn exchanged for shares of Coors Common Stock shall be deemed
at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender (i) the certificate representing the shares of the
appropriate class of Coors Common Stock received in exchange for Preferred
Shares as contemplated by this section 4.2, (ii) a cash payment in lieu of
any fractional Preferred Shares as contemplated by section 4.4 and (iii) any
dividends or distributions with a record date after the Listing Time
theretofore paid or payable with respect to such shares of Coors Common Stock
as contemplated by section 4.3, in each case less any amounts
withheld pursuant to section 4.7.

  

4.3 Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates

   

 No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Exchangeable Shares, Preferred Shares or Coors Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Molson Shares that were exchanged pursuant to section 2.2, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to section 4.4 and no interest shall be earned or payable on these proceeds, unless and until the holder of such certificate shall surrender such certificate in accordance with section 4.1 or 4.2. Subject to applicable law, at the time of such surrender of any such certificate (or, in the case of clause (iii) below, at the appropriate payment date), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates previously representing Molson Shares, without interest, (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Exchangeable Share or Preferred Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to section 4.4, (ii) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to the Exchangeable Shares or after the Listing Time theretofore paid with respect to Coors Common Stock, as the case may be, to which such holder is entitled pursuant hereto and (iii) on the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after 

        
  

the Effective Time or after the Listing Time, as the case may be, but prior
to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect
to such Exchangeable Shares or Coors Common Stock, as the case may be.

  

4.4 No Fractional Shares

  

 No certificates representing fractional Exchangeable Shares, Preferred Shares or shares of Coors Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates pursuant to sections 4.1 or 4.2 and no dividend, stock split or other change in the capital structure of Exchangeco or Coors shall relate to any such fractional security and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to exercise any rights as a security holder of Exchangeco or Coors. In lieu of any such fractional securities, each Person otherwise entitled to a fractional interest in an Exchangeable Share, Preferred Share or share of Coors Common Stock will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to such Person\'s pro rata portion of the net proceeds after expenses received by the Depositary upon the sale of whole shares representing an accumulation of all fractional interests in Exchangeable Shares, shares of Coors Common Stock, or, in the case of Preferred Shares, shares of Coors Common Stock for which such fractional Preferred Share would otherwise have been exchanged, to which all such Persons would otherwise be entitled. The Depositary will sell such Exchangeable Shares by private sale (including by way sale through the facilities of any stock exchange upon which the Exchangeable Shares are then listed) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date. The aggregate net proceeds after expenses of such sale will be distributed by the Depositary, pro rata in relation to the respective fractions, among Persons otherwise entitled to receive fractional interests in Exchangeable Shares. The Depositary will sell such shares of Coors Common Stock (or shares of Coors Common Stock for which such fractional Preferred Share would otherwise have been exchanged) on the NYSE as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date. The aggregate net proceeds after expenses of such sale will be distributed by the Depositary, pro rata in relation to the respective fractions, among Persons otherwise entitled to receive fractional interests in shares of Coors Common Stock (or fractional interests in Preferred Shares which would otherwise have been exchanged for shares of Coors Common Stock). 

   

 A holder of an Exchangeable Share shall not be entitled to any fraction of a share of Coors Common Stock upon the exercise by Callco of the Liquidation Call Right or the Redemption Call Right and no certificate representing any such fractional interest shall be issued and such holder otherwise entitled to a fractional interest will receive for such fractional interest from Callco or Coors, as the case may be, on the designated payment date a cash payment equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Coors Trading Price. 

  

4.5 Lost Certificates

  

 In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding Molson Shares that were exchanged pursuant to section 2.2 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, any cash pursuant to section 4.4 and/or one or more certificates representing one or more Exchangeable Shares or shares of Coors Common Stock (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto) deliverable in accordance with such holder\'s Letter of Transmittal and Election Form. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom certificates representing Exchangeable Shares or shares of Coors Common Stock are to be issued shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to Exchangeco, Coors and their respective transfer agents in such sum as Exchangeco or Coors may direct or otherwise indemnify Exchangeco and Coors in a manner satisfactory to Exchangeco and Coors against any claim 

        
  

that may be made against Exchangeco or Coors with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

   

4.6 Extinction of Rights

  

 Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Molson Shares that were exchanged pursuant to section 2.2 that is not deposited with all other instruments required by section 4.1 or 4.2 on or prior to the date of the notice referred to in section 7.2 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions shall cease to represent a claim or interest of any kind or nature as a shareholder of Exchangeco or Coors. On such date, the Exchangeable Shares or shares of Coors Common Stock (or cash in lieu of fractional interests therein, as provided in section 4.4) to which the former holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no consideration to Exchangeco or Coors, as the case may be, together with all entitlements to dividends, distributions and interest in respect thereof held for such former holder. None of Coors, Exchangeco, Callco or the Depositary shall be liable to any person in respect of any Coors Common Stock or Exchangeable Shares (or dividends, distributions and interest in respect thereof) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

4.7 Withholding Rights

  

 Exchangeco, Callco, Coors and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Molson Shares, Preferred Shares, Coors Common Stock or Exchangeable Shares such amounts as Exchangeco, Callco, Coors or the Depositary is (i) required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the ITA, the United States _Internal Revenue Code of 1986_ or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case, as amended or succeeded, or (ii) entitled to deduct and withhold under section 116 of the ITA or any corresponding provisions of provincial law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the amount so required or entitled to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, Exchangeco, Callco, Coors and the Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Exchangeco, Callco, Coors or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement or entitlement and Exchangeco, Callco, Coors or the Depositary shall notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale, provided however that nothing in this section 4.7 shall reduce Exchangeco\'s obligations under section 6.1(h) of the Combination Agreement or section 3.2 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions. References in this section to the ITA are to the ITA as amended from time to time. 

  

ARTICLE 5 
 CERTAIN RIGHTS OF CALLCO TO ACQUIRE EXCHANGEABLE SHARES

  

5.1 Callco Liquidation Call Right

  

 

 (a)

 Callco shall have the overriding right (the "Liquidation Call Right"), in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco pursuant to Article 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Coors or an affiliate of Coors) on the Liquidation Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder on payment by Callco of an amount per share (the "Liquidation Call Purchase Price") equal to the sum of, (i) the Current Market Price of 
 

      

   

a share of Corresponding Coors Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to
the Liquidation Date, which shall be satisfied in full by Callco causing to be
delivered to such holder one share of Corresponding Coors Stock, plus (ii)
any Dividend Amount. In the event of the exercise of the Liquidation Call
Right by Callco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the
Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to Callco on the Liquidation Date on
payment by Callco to the holder of the Liquidation Call Purchase Price for
each such share, and Exchangeco shall have no obligation to pay any
Liquidation Amount to the holders of such shares so purchased by Callco.

   

 (b)

 To exercise the Liquidation Call Right, Callco must notify Exchangeco\'s transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent"), as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and Exchangeco of Callco\'s intention to exercise such right at least 60 days before the Liquidation Date in the case of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco and at least five Business Days before the Liquidation Date in the case of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Callco has exercised the Liquidation Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises the Liquidation Call Right, then on the Liquidation Date, Callco will purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the Liquidation Call Purchase Price.  


(c)

 For the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right, Callco shall deposit or cause to be delivered with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date, certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Coors Common Stock deliverable by Callco and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco representing the aggregate Dividend Amount, if any, in payment of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price for all holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its affiliates), less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7 hereof. Provided that Callco has complied with the immediately preceding sentence, on and after the Liquidation Date each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its affiliates) shall cease to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, and the rights of each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its affiliates) will be limited to receiving, without interest, such holder\'s proportionate part of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price payable by Callco upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the Liquidation Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the shares of Coors Common Stock to which it is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents, instruments and payments (including without limitation Stamp Taxes) as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the articles and by-laws of Exchangeco and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver or cause to be delivered to such holder, certificates representing the shares of Coors Common Stock to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco in payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7 hereof. For greater certainty, if Callco does not exercise the Liquidation Call Right in the manner described above, on the Liquidation Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Liquidation Amount otherwise payable by Exchangeco in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco pursuant to Article 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions. 
 

      

   

  

5.2 Callco Redemption Call Right

  

 In addition to Callco\'s rights contained in the Exchangeable Share Provisions, including, without limitation, the Retraction Call Right (as defined in the Exchangeable Share Provisions), Callco shall have the following rights in respect of the Exchangeable Shares: 

  

 

 (a)

 Callco shall have the overriding right (the "Redemption Call Right"), notwithstanding the proposed redemption of the Exchangeable Shares by Exchangeco pursuant to Article 7 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Coors or an affiliate of Coors) on the Redemption Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder on payment by Callco to each holder of an amount per Exchangeable Share (the "Redemption Call Purchase Price") equal to the sum of, (i) the Current Market Price of a share of Corresponding Coors Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date, which shall be satisfied in full by Callco causing to be delivered to such holder one share of Corresponding Coors Stock, plus (ii) any Dividend Amount. In the event of the exercise of the Redemption Call Right by Callco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to Callco on the Redemption Date on payment by Callco to the holder of the Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such share, and Exchangeco shall have no obligation to redeem, or to pay any Dividend Amount in respect of, such shares so purchased by Callco.  


(b)

 To exercise the Redemption Call Right, Callco must notify the Transfer Agent, as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and Exchangeco of Callco\'s intention to exercise such right at least 60 days before the Redemption Date. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Callco has exercised the Redemption Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises the Redemption Call Right, on the Redemption Date Callco will purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the Redemption Call Purchase Price.  


(c)

 For the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, Callco shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Redemption Date, certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock deliverable by Callco and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco representing the aggregate Dividend Amount, if any, in payment of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7 hereof. Provided that Callco has complied with the immediately preceding sentence, on and after the Redemption Date each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its affiliates) shall cease to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, and the rights of each holder of Exchangeable Shares will be limited to receiving such holder\'s proportionate part of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price payable by Callco upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the Redemption Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which it is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA, and the articles and by-laws of Exchangeco and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver to such holder, certificates representing the shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which the holder is 
 

      

   

entitled and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of
the bankers of Callco in payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the
total Redemption Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to
section 4.7 hereof. If Callco does not exercise the Redemption Call Right in
the manner described above, on the Redemption Date the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
redemption price otherwise payable by Exchangeco in connection with the
redemption of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Article 7 of the
Exchangeable Share Provisions.

ARTICLE 2 
 RANKING OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES

  

 2.1

 The Class A Exchangeable Shares and Class B Exchangeable Shares shall rank _pari passu_ and shall be entitled, subject to the prior rights of the holders of any Preferred Shares which by their terms rank senior to the Exchangeable Shares, to a preference over the Common Shares and any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the distribution of assets in the 
      

  

event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of the assets of
the Corporation, among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its
affairs.

  

 

 2.2

 The Common Shares, subject to the prior rights of any Preferred Shares which by their terms rank senior to the Common Shares, shall be entitled to a preference over the Exchangeable Shares and any other share ranking junior to the Common Shares with respect to the payment of dividends. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Common Shares do not rank in priority to the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the entitlement to dividends pursuant to Article 3 hereof. 
 

ARTICLE 3 
 DIVIDENDS

  

 3.1

 A holder of a Corresponding Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to receive and the Board of Directors shall, subject to applicable law, on each Coors Dividend Declaration Date, declare a dividend on each Corresponding Exchangeable Share:  

 

 (a)

 in the case of a cash dividend declared on the Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, in an amount in cash for each Corresponding Exchangeable Share in U.S. dollars, or the Canadian Dollar Equivalent thereof on the Coors Dividend Declaration Date, in each case, corresponding to the cash dividend declared on each share of Coors Class A Common Stock or share of Coors Class B Common Stock, as the case may be;  


(b)

 in the case of a stock dividend declared on the Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock to be paid in Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, by the issue or transfer by the Corporation of such number of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares for each Corresponding Exchangeable Share as is equal to the number of shares of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock to be paid on each share of Coors Class A Common Stock or share of Class B Common Stock as the case may be unless in lieu of such stock dividend the Corporation elects to effect a corresponding and contemporaneous and economically equivalent (as determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with section 3.5 hereof) subdivision of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares; or  


(c)

 in the case of a dividend declared on the Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock in property other than cash or Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, in such type and amount of property for each Corresponding Exchangeable Share as is the same as or economically equivalent to (to be determined by the Board of Directors as contemplated by section 3.6 hereof) the type and amount of property declared as a dividend on each share of Coors Class A Common Stock or share of Coors Class B Common Stock, as the case may be. 
 

 

  

Such dividends shall be paid out of money, assets or property of the
Corporation properly applicable to the payment of dividends, or out of
authorized but unissued shares of the Corporation, as applicable. The holders
of the Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled to any dividends other than
or in excess of the dividends referred to in this section 3.1.

  

 

 3.2

 The Corporation covenants that it will pay additional amounts with respect to any dividends paid to a Canadian resident holder of Exchangeable Shares in the event that any withholding taxes other than Canadian Federal or Provincial taxes withheld at source ("non-Canadian withholding taxes") are imposed, directly or indirectly, in respect of such dividends. Such additional amounts shall be determined such that, on an after-tax basis, the Canadian resident holder has received the same amount that it would have received if no non-Canadian withholding taxes had been imposed, taking into account any increased (x) gross income tax imposed directly on such holder by the jurisdiction imposing such non-Canadian withholding taxes, (y) non-Canadian withholding tax and 
      

  

(z) Canadian income tax, in each case, in respect of such additional amounts
after any reductions of income, credits or deductions available to such holder
arising as a result of such non-Canadian withholding taxes or any payments
under this section 3.2 (and only to the extent a net increase in tax is
reasonably demonstrated by such holder). If gross income tax in the
jurisdiction imposing such non-Canadian withholding taxes is paid directly by
a Canadian resident holder of Exchangeable Shares with respect to dividends on
such Exchangeable Shares or any payment made under this section 3.2, the
Corporation shall make a tax reimbursement payment to the Canadian resident
holder of the Exchangeable Shares for any such taxes (whether such taxes are
actually withheld, paid by reason of notice received from a taxing authority
or otherwise) not covered by additional amounts described above (and computed
by treating the tax reimbursement payment for purposes of this section as an
additional amount to which this section applies). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such additional amounts and tax reimbursement payments will not
apply to the extent non-Canadian withholding taxes are imposed at a rate in
excess of the withholding tax rate applicable to payments of dividends to
individuals under the income tax treaty between the United States and Canada,
or any successor treaty. Without limiting a Canadian resident holder\'s
obligation to reasonably demonstrate a net increase in taxes imposed as
described above, nothing contained herein shall require any Canadian resident
holder of the Exchangeable Shares to disclose any confidential or propriety
information (including, without limitation, its tax return). In no event
shall anything in this section 3.2 require any Canadian resident holder of
Exchangeable Shares to arrange its tax affairs in any particular manner.

  

 

 3.3

 Cheques of the Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation shall be issued in respect of any cash dividends contemplated by section 3.1(a) hereof and the sending of such a cheque to each holder of a Corresponding Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the cash dividend represented thereby unless the cheque is not paid on presentation. Certificates registered in the name of the registered holder of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares shall be issued or transferred in respect of any stock dividends contemplated by section 3.1(b) hereof and the sending of such a certificate to each holder of a Corresponding Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the stock dividend represented thereby. Such other type and amount of property in respect of any dividends contemplated by section 3.1(c) hereof shall be issued, distributed or transferred by the Corporation in such manner as it shall determine and the issuance, distribution or transfer thereof by the Corporation to each holder of a Corresponding Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the dividend represented thereby. No holder of a Corresponding Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to recover by action or other legal process against the Corporation any dividend that is represented by a cheque that has not been duly presented to the Corporation\'s bankers for payment or that otherwise remains unclaimed for a period of six years from the date on which such dividend was payable.  


3.4

 The record date for the determination of the holders of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares entitled to receive payment of, and the payment date for, any dividend declared on the Corresponding Exchangeable Shares under section 3.1 hereof shall be the same dates as the record date and payment date, respectively, for the corresponding dividend declared on the Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, as the case may be.  


3.5

 If on any payment date for any dividends declared on the Corresponding Exchangeable Shares under section 3.1 hereof the dividends are not paid in full on all of the Corresponding Exchangeable Shares then outstanding, any such dividends that remain unpaid shall be paid on a subsequent date or dates determined by the Board of Directors on which the Corporation shall have sufficient moneys, assets or property properly applicable to the payment of such dividends.  


3.6

 For the purposes of section 3.1 hereof, the Board of Directors shall determine, in good faith and in its sole discretion with assistance of such reputable and qualified independent financial advisors and/or other experts as the Board of Directors may require, economic equivalence and each such 
      

  

determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Corporation and its
shareholders. In making each such determination, the following factors shall,
without excluding other factors determined by the Board of Directors to be
relevant, be considered by the Board of Directors:

  

 (a)

 in the case of any stock dividend or other distribution payable in Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, the number of such shares issued in proportion to the number of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock previously outstanding;  


(b)

 in the case of the issuance or distribution of any rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock), the relationship between the exercise price of each such right, option or warrant and the Current Market Price of a Corresponding Coors Share;  


(c)

 in the case of the issuance or distribution of any other form of property (including without limitation any shares or securities of Coors of any class other than Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, any rights, options or warrants other than those referred to in section 3.6(b) above, any evidences of indebtedness of Coors or any assets of Coors) the relationship between the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors in the manner above contemplated) of such property to be issued or distributed with respect to each outstanding Class A Share or Class B Share and the Current Market Price of a Corresponding Coors Share;  


(d)

 in the case of any subdivision, redivision or change of the then outstanding Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock into a greater number of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock or the reduction, combination or consolidation or change of the then outstanding Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock into a lesser number of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock or any amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other transaction affecting the Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, the effect thereof upon the then outstanding Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock; and  


(e)

 in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of the relevant event to beneficial owners of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares to the extent that such consequences may differ from the general taxation consequences to such beneficial owners determined as if they owned Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock at the relevant time as a result of differences between taxation laws of Canada and the United States (except for any differing consequences arising as a result of differing marginal taxation rates and without regard to the individual circumstances of holders of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares). 
 

  
 

ARTICLE 4 
 CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS

  

 4.1

 So long as any of the Exchangeable Shares are outstanding, the Corporation shall not at any time without, but may at any time with, the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as specified in section 10.2 of these share provisions:  

 

 (a)

 pay any dividends on the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, other than stock dividends payable in Common Shares or any such other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be;  


(b)

 redeem or purchase or make any capital distribution in respect of Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares; 
 

      

   

 (c)

 redeem or purchase any other shares of the Corporation ranking equally with the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of dividends or on any liquidation distribution; or  


(d)

 issue any Exchangeable Shares or any other shares of the Corporation ranking equally with, or superior to, the Exchangeable Shares other than by way of stock dividends to the holders of such Exchangeable Shares. 
 

   

The restrictions in sections 4.1(a), (b), (c) and (d) above shall not apply
to any class of Exchangeable Shares if all dividends on such class of the
outstanding Exchangeable Shares corresponding to dividends declared and paid
to date on the Corresponding Coors Common Stock shall have been declared and
paid on such class of Exchangeable Shares.

  

 

ARTICLE 5 
 DISTRIBUTION ON LIQUIDATION

  

 5.1

 In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation or any other distribution of the assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, subject to Callco\'s exercise of the Liquidation Call Right, a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled, subject to applicable law, to receive from the assets of the Corporation in respect of each Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the effective date (the "Liquidation Date") of such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, before any distribution of any part of the assets of the Corporation among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, an amount per share (the "Liquidation Amount") equal to the sum of, (i) Current Market Price of a Corresponding Coors Share on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder one Corresponding Coors Share, plus (ii) an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the Liquidation Date.  


5.2

 On or promptly after the Liquidation Date, and subject to the exercise by Callco of the Liquidation Call Right, the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount for each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the Articles of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require, at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the register of the Corporation for the Exchangeable Shares or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, on behalf of the Corporation of certificates representing Corresponding Coors Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) and a cheque of the Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation in respect of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Liquidation Amount (in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof). On and after the Liquidation Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount, unless payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of share certificates in accordance with 
      

  

the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall
remain unaffected until the total Liquidation Amount has been paid in the
manner hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall have the right at any
time after the Liquidation Date to deposit or cause to be deposited the total
Liquidation Amount in respect of the Exchangeable Shares represented by
certificates that have not at the Liquidation Date been surrendered by the
holders thereof in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust
company in Canada, less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant
to Article 13 hereof. Upon such deposit being made, the rights of the holders
of Exchangeable Shares after such deposit shall be limited to receiving their
proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable
Shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the said
certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing
provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Liquidation Amount
(which, for greater certainty, shall be net of any amounts withheld on account
of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof), the holders of the Exchangeable Shares
shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of
the Corresponding Coors Common Stock delivered to them or the custodian on
their behalf.

  

 

 5.3

 After the Corporation has satisfied its obligations to pay the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount per Exchangeable Share pursuant to section 5.1 of these share provisions, such holders shall not be entitled to share in any further distribution of the assets of the Corporation.  


5.4

 Callco shall have the overriding right (the "Liquidation Call Right"), in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation pursuant to section 5.1 of these share provisions to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Coors or an Affiliate of Coors) on the Liquidation Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder on payment by Callco of an amount per share (the "Liquidation Call Purchase Price") equal to the sum of, (i) the Current Market Price of a share of Corresponding Coors Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which shall be satisfied in full by Callco causing to be delivered for each such Exchangeable Share to such holder one share of Corresponding Coors Common Stock, plus (ii) any Dividend Amount. In the event of the exercise of the Liquidation Call Right by Callco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to Callco on the Liquidation Date on payment by Callco to the holder of the Liquidation Call Purchase Price for each such share, and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay any Liquidation Amount to the holders of such shares so purchased by Callco.  


5.5

 To exercise the Liquidation Call Right, Callco must notify the Transfer Agent as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares and the Corporation of Callco\'s intention to exercise such right at least 60 days before the Liquidation Date in the case of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation and at least five Business Days before the Liquidation Date in the case of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Callco has exercised the Liquidation Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises the Liquidation Call Right, then on the Liquidation Date Callco will purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the Liquidation Call Purchase Price. 
      

  

 5.6

 For the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right, Callco shall deposit or cause to be delivered with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date, certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock deliverable by Callco and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco representing the aggregate Dividend Amount, if any, in payment of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price for all holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its Affiliates) less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. Provided that Callco has complied with the immediately preceding sentence, on and after the Liquidation Date, each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its Affiliates) shall cease to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, the rights of each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its Affiliates) will be limited to receiving, without interest, such holder\'s proportionate part of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price payable by Callco upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the Liquidation Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which it is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents, instruments and payments (including, without limitation, any applicable Stamp Taxes) as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the Articles and by-laws of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver or cause to be delivered to such holder, certificates representing the Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco in payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Article 13 hereof. For greater certainty, if Callco does not exercise the Liquidation Call Right in the manner described above, on the Liquidation Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Liquidation Amount otherwise payable by the Corporation in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation pursuant to section 5.2 hereof. 
 

ARTICLE 6 
 RETRACTION OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY HOLDER

  

 6.1

 A holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at any time, subject to the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right and otherwise upon compliance with the provisions of this Article 6, to require the Corporation to redeem any or all of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount per share equal to the sum of (i) the Current Market Price of a Corresponding Coors Share on the last Business Day prior to the Retraction Date (the "Retraction Price"), which shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder one Corresponding Coors Share for each Exchangeable Share presented and surrendered by the holder, and (ii) on the designated payment date therefor, the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on any such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the Retraction Date. To effect such redemption, the holder shall present and surrender at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares the certificate or certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Corporation redeem, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the Articles of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require, and together with a duly executed statement 
      

  

(the "Retraction Request") in the form of Schedule A hereto or in such other
form as may be acceptable to the Corporation:

  

 (a)

 specifying that the holder desires to have all or any number specified therein of the Exchangeable Shares represented by such certificate or certificates (the "Retracted Shares") redeemed by the Corporation;  


(b)

 stating the Business Day on which the holder desires to have the Corporation redeem the Retracted Shares (the "Retraction Date"), provided that the Retraction Date shall be not less than 10 Business Days nor more than 15 Business Days after the date on which the Retraction Request is received by the Corporation and further provided that, in the event that no such Business Day is specified by the holder in the Retraction Request, the Retraction Date shall be deemed to be the 15th Business Day after the date on which the Retraction Request is received by the Corporation; and  


(c)

 acknowledging the overriding right (the "Retraction Call Right") of Callco to purchase all but not less than all the Retracted Shares directly from the holder and that the Retraction Request shall be deemed to be a revocable offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Callco in accordance with the Retraction Call Right on the terms and conditions set out in section 6.3 below, 
 

   

provided however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an
Offer as defined in section 2.8 of the Exchangeable Share Support Agreement,
the Corporation will use its commercially reasonable efforts, expeditiously
and in good faith to put in place procedures or to cause the Transfer Agent to
put in place procedures to ensure that, if holders of Corresponding
Exchangeable Shares are required to retract such Corresponding Exchangeable
Shares to participate in the Offer, that any such retraction shall be
conditional upon and shall only be effective if the Corresponding
Coors Common Stock tendered or deposited under such Offer is taken up.

  

 

 6.2

 Subject to the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right, upon receipt by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent in the manner specified in section 6.1 hereof of a certificate or certificates representing the number of Retracted Shares, together with a Retraction Request, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 6.7, the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the close of business on the Retraction Date and shall deliver or cause to be delivered to such holder the total Retraction Price. If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate is redeemed (or purchased by Callco pursuant to the Retraction Call Right), a new certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at the expense of the Corporation.  


6.3

 Upon receipt by the Corporation of a Retraction Request, the Corporation shall immediately notify Callco thereof and shall provide to Callco a copy of the Retraction Request. In order to exercise the Retraction Call Right, Callco must notify the Corporation of its determination to do so (the "Callco Call Notice") within five Business Days of notification to Callco by the Corporation of the receipt by the Corporation of the Retraction Request. If Callco does not so notify the Corporation within such five Business Day period, the Corporation will notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter that Callco will not exercise the Retraction Call Right. If Callco delivers the Callco Call Notice within such five Business Day period, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 6.7, the Retraction Request shall thereupon be considered only to be an offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Callco in accordance with the Retraction Call Right. In such event, the Corporation shall not redeem the Retracted Shares and Callco shall purchase from such holder and such holder shall sell to Callco on the Retraction Date the Retracted Shares for a purchase price (the "Purchase Price") per share equal to the sum of, (i) the Retraction Price per share, plus 
      

  

(ii) on the designated payment date therefor, to the extent not paid by the
Corporation on the designated payment date therefor, any Dividend Amount in
respect of the Retracted Shares. To the extent that Callco pays the Dividend
Amount in respect of the Retracted Shares, the Corporation shall no longer be
obligated to pay any declared and unpaid dividends on such Retracted Shares.
Provided that Callco has complied with section 6.4, the closing of the
purchase and sale of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the Retraction Call
Right shall be deemed to have occurred as at the close of business on the
Retraction Date and, for greater certainty, no redemption by the Corporation
of such Retracted Shares shall take place on the Retraction Date. In the event
that Callco does not deliver a Callco Call Notice within such five Business
Day period, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the
holder in the manner specified in section 6.7, the Corporation shall redeem
the Retracted Shares on the Retraction Date and in the manner otherwise
contemplated in this Article 6\.

  

 

 6.4

 The Corporation or Callco, as the case may be, shall deliver or cause the Transfer Agent to deliver to the relevant holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the register of the Corporation for the Exchangeable Shares or at the address specified in the holder\'s Retraction Request or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, certificates representing the Corresponding Coors Common Stock (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) registered in the name of the holder or in such other name as the holder may request, and, if applicable and on or before the payment date therefor, a cheque payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation or Callco, as applicable, representing the aggregate declared and unpaid dividends or the aggregate Dividend Amount, as the case may be, in payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, in each case, less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof, and such delivery of such certificates and cheques on behalf of the Corporation or by Callco, as the case may be, or by the Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the total Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, to the extent that the same is represented by such share certificates and cheques (plus any tax deducted and withheld therefrom and remitted to the proper tax authority).  


6.5

 On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the holder of the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive his proportionate part of the total Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, unless upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, shall not be made as provided in section 6.4, in which case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected until the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, provided that presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted Shares so redeemed by the Corporation or purchased by Callco shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of the Corresponding Coors Common Stock delivered to it.  


6.6

 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 6, the Corporation shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law. If the Corporation believes that on any Retraction Date it would not be permitted by any of such provisions to redeem the Retracted Shares tendered for redemption on such date, 
      

  

and provided that Callco shall not have exercised the Retraction Call Right
with respect to the Retracted Shares, the Corporation shall only be obligated
to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to
the extent of the maximum number that may be so redeemed (rounded down to a
whole number of shares) as would not be contrary to such provisions and shall
notify the holder and the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the
Retraction Date as to the number of Retracted Shares which will not be
redeemed by the Corporation. In any case in which the redemption by the
Corporation of Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or
other provisions of applicable law, the Corporation shall redeem Retracted
Shares in accordance with section 6.2 of these share provisions on a pro rata
basis and shall issue to each holder of Retracted Shares a new certificate, at
the expense of the Corporation, representing the Retracted Shares not
redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to section 6.2 hereof. Provided that the
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in
section 6.7, the holder of any such Retracted Shares not redeemed by the
Corporation pursuant to section 6.2 of these share provisions as a result of
solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law shall be deemed
by giving the Retraction Request to require Coors to purchase such Retracted
Shares from such holder on the Retraction Date or as soon as practicable
thereafter, provided that Callco has not exercised the Retraction Call Right
with respect to the Retracted Shares, on payment by Coors to such holder of
the Purchase Price for each such Retracted Share, all as more
specifically provided in the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.

  

 

 6.7

 A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the holder to the Corporation before the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction Request, in which event such Retraction Request shall be null and void and, for greater certainty, the revocable offer constituted by the Retraction Request to sell the Retracted Shares to Callco shall be deemed to have been revoked. 
 

ARTICLE 7 
 REDEMPTION OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY THE CORPORATION

  

 7.1

 Subject to applicable law, and provided Callco has not exercised the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall on the Redemption Date redeem all but not less than all of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares for an amount per share equal to the sum of, (i) the Current Market Price of a Corresponding Coors Share on the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (the "Redemption Price"), which shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation delivering or causing to be delivered to each holder of Exchangeable Shares one Corresponding Coors Share for each Exchangeable Share held by such holder, together with (ii) the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the Redemption Date.  


7.2

 In any case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this Article 7, the Corporation shall, at least 60 days before the Redemption Date, send or cause to be sent to each holder of Exchangeable Shares a notice in writing of the redemption by the Corporation or the purchase by Callco under the Redemption Call Right, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder. Notice of an Exempt Exchangeable Share Voting Event, the written notice of redemption by the Corporation or the purchase by Callco under the Redemption Call Right will be sent on or before the Redemption Date, on as many days prior written notice as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation to be reasonably practicable in the circumstances. In any such case, such notice shall set out the formula for determining the Redemption Price or the Redemption Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, the Redemption Date and, if applicable, particulars of the Redemption Call Right.  


7.3

 On or after the Redemption Date and subject to the exercise by Callco of the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable 
      

  

Shares to be redeemed the Redemption Price for each such Exchangeable Share,
together with the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each
such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which
occurred prior to the Redemption Date, upon presentation and surrender at the
registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as
may be specified by the Corporation in such notice of the certificates
representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares
under the CBCA and the Articles of the Corporation and such additional
documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may
reasonably require. Payment of the total Redemption Price for such
Exchangeable Shares, together with payment of such dividends, shall be made by
delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the register
of the Corporation or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered
office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be
specified by the Corporation in such notice, on behalf of the Corporation of
certificates representing Corresponding Coors Common Stock (which shares shall
be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear
of any lien, claim or encumbrance) and, if applicable, a cheque of the
Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation in
payment of any such dividends, in each case, less any amounts withheld on
account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. On and after the Redemption
Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares called for redemption shall cease
to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right
to receive their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price and any
such dividends, unless payment of the total Redemption Price and any such
dividends for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and
surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in
which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total
Redemption Price and any such dividends have been paid in the manner
hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall have the right at any time after
the sending of notice of its intention to redeem the Exchangeable Shares as
aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Redemption Price for
and the full amount of such dividends on the Exchangeable Shares (except as
otherwise provided in this section 7.3) so called for redemption, or of
such of the said Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have
not at the date of such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof in
connection with such redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered
bank or trust company in Canada named in such notice, less any amounts
withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. Upon the later of
such deposit being made and the Redemption Date, the Exchangeable Shares in
respect whereof such deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed and the
rights of the holders thereof after such deposit or Redemption Date, as
the case may be, shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of
the total Redemption Price and such dividends for such Exchangeable Shares so
deposited, against presentation and surrender of the said certificates held
by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such
payment or deposit of the total Redemption Price (which, for greater
certainty, shall be net of any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to
Article 13 hereof) and the full amount of such dividends, the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all
purposes to be holders of the Corresponding Coors Common Stock delivered to
them or the custodian on their behalf.

  

 

 7.4

 Callco shall have the overriding right (the "Redemption Call Right"), notwithstanding the proposed redemption of the Exchangeable Shares by the Corporation pursuant to section 7.1 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Coors or an Affiliate of Coors) on the Redemption Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder on payment by Callco to each holder of an amount per Exchangeable Share (the "Redemption Call Purchase Price") equal to the sum of (i) the Current Market Price of a share of 
      

  

Corresponding Coors Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the
Redemption Date, which shall be satisfied in full by Callco causing to be
delivered for each such Exchangeable Share to such holder one share of
Corresponding Coors Common Stock, plus any Dividend Amount. In the event of
the exercise of the Redemption Call Right by Callco, each holder shall be
obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to Callco on
the Redemption Date on payment by Callco to the holder of the Redemption Call
Purchase Price for each such share, and the Corporation shall have
no obligation to redeem, or to pay any Dividend Amount in respect of, such
shares so purchased by Callco.

  

 

 7.5

 To exercise the Redemption Call Right, Callco must notify the Transfer Agent and the Corporation of Callco\'s intention to exercise such right at least 60 days before the Redemption Date. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Callco has exercised the Redemption Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises the Redemption Call Right, on the Redemption Date Callco will purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the Redemption Call Purchase Price.  


7.6

 For the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, Callco shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Redemption Date, certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock deliverable by Callco and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco representing the aggregate Dividend Amount, if any, in payment of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. Provided that Callco has complied with the immediately preceding sentence, on and after the Redemption Date, each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its Affiliates) shall cease to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, and the rights of each holder of Exchangeable Shares will be limited to receiving such holder\'s proportionate part of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price payable by Callco upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the Redemption Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which it is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA, the Articles and by-laws of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver to such holder, certificates representing the Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or cheques of Coors payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco in payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. For greater certainty, if Callco does not exercise the Redemption Call Right in the manner described above, on the Redemption Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Redemption Price otherwise payable by the Corporation pursuant to section 7.3 hereof. 
 

ARTICLE 8 
 PURCHASE FOR CANCELLATION

  

 8.1

 Subject to applicable law, the Corporation may at any time and from time to time purchase for cancellation all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares. 
      

ARTICLE 9 
 VOTING RIGHTS

  

 9.1

 Except as required by applicable law and by Article 10 hereof, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled as such to receive notice of or to attend any meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation or to vote at any such meeting. The holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall, however, be entitled to notice of meetings of the shareholders called for the purpose of authorizing the dissolution of the Corporation or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the property of the Corporation other than in the ordinary course of business of the Corporation. 
 

ARTICLE 10

At such adjourned meeting the holders of Exchangeable Shares eligible to vote at such meeting present or represented by proxy thereat may transact the business for which the meeting was originally called and a resolution passed thereat by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at such meeting shall constitute the approval or consent of the holders of such class of the Exchangeable Shares or of the holders of all Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be. 
 

ARTICLE 11 
 RECIPROCAL CHANGES, ETC. IN RESPECT OF 
 CORRESPONDING COORS COMMON STOCK

  

 11.1

 Each holder of an Exchangeable Share acknowledges that the Exchangeable Share Support Agreement provides, in part, that so long as any Exchangeable Shares (other than those owned by Coors and its Affiliates) are outstanding, Coors will not without the prior approval of the Corporation and the prior approval of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section 10.2 of these share provisions:  

 

 (a)

 issue or distribute Corresponding Coors Common Stock (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Common Stock) to the holders of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Common Stock by way of stock dividend or other distribution, other than an issue of Corresponding Coors 
 

      

   

Common Stock (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying
rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Common Stock) to holders of
Corresponding Coors Common Stock who exercise an option to receive dividends
in Corresponding Coors Common Stock (or securities exchangeable for or
convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Common
Stock) in lieu of receiving cash dividends;

   

 (b)

 issue or distribute rights, options or warrants to the holders of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or to purchase Corresponding Coors Common Stock (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Common Stock); or  


(c)

 issue or distribute to the holders of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Common Stock:  

 

 (i)

 shares or securities of Coors of any class other than Corresponding Coors Common Stock (other than shares convertible into or exchangeable for or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Common Stock);

distributed simultaneously to holders of the affected class of Exchangeable
Shares.

  

 

 11.2

 Each holder of an Exchangeable Share acknowledges that the Exchangeable Share Support Agreement further provides, in part, that so long as any Exchangeable Shares (other than those owned by Coors and its Affiliates) are outstanding, Coors will not without the prior approval of the Corporation and the prior approval of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section 10.2 of these share provisions:  

 

 (a)

 subdivide, redivide or change the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Common Stock into a greater number of Corresponding Coors Common Stock;  


(b)

 reduce, combine, consolidate or change the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Common Stock into a lesser number of Corresponding Coors Common Stock; or  


(c)

 reclassify or otherwise change the Corresponding Coors Common Stock or effect an amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other transaction affecting the Corresponding Coors Common Stock, 
 

 

  

unless the same or an economically equivalent change shall simultaneously be
made to, or in, the rights of the holders of the affected class of
Exchangeable Shares. The Exchangeable Share Support Agreement further
provides, in part, that the aforesaid provisions of the Exchangeable Share
Support Agreement shall not be changed without the approval of the holders of
the affected class of Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section
10.2 of these share provisions.

other legal entity other than such other person or continuing corporation,
then such corporation or other legal entity in which holders of shares in the
capital of Coors are entitled to receive an interest) is herein called the
"Coors Successor") then, provided that the Coors Successor is bound, or has
agreed to be bound, by the provisions of the Voting and Exchange Trust
Agreement and Support Agreement and to assume the obligations of Coors
thereunder to the satisfaction of the Board of Directors, all references in
these Share Provisions to Coors Common Shares shall be deemed to be
references to the shares of the Coors Successor which has assumed the
obligations of Coors and all references to Coors shall be to Coors Successor,
without amendment to these Share Provisions or any further action whatsoever.
For greater certainty, if a transaction described in this section 11.3 results
in holders of Exchangeable Shares being entitled to exchange their
Exchangeable Shares for shares of a Coors Successor in a different ratio than
that set out in these share provisions, then these share provisions shall be
deemed to be amended to refer to such different ratio(s).

 Subject to section 16.5 hereof, if an Exclusionary Offer is made, each outstanding Class B Exchangeable Share shall be convertible into one fully paid and non-assessable Class A Exchangeable Share at the option of the holder thereof during the Conversion Period.

Class A Common Stock corresponding to the Converted Stock into Coors Class B

Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be, pursuant to such election in respect
of which the holder exercises his or her right of withdrawal from the

The Corporation shall make all arrangements with the transfer agent necessary or desirable to give effect to this section 16.4.

16.6

 The Corporation and the Transfer Agent will use their commercially reasonable efforts expeditiously and in good faith to put in place procedures or to cause the Transfer Agent to put in place procedures to ensure, that if a holder elects to exercise the conversion right in section 16.2 and a retraction of the Converted Shares pursuant to section 16.3 is required to participate in the Exclusionary Offer, that any such retraction shall be conditional upon and shall only be effective if the Corresponding Coors Common Stock tendered or deposited under such Offer is taken up.

ARTICLE 18

In order to effect a Conversion, a holder of shares of Class A Exchangeable Shares must deliver at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of the Class A Exchangeable Shares (i) a written notice of such holder\'s election to convert (a "Notice of Conversion") shares of Class A Exchangeable Shares specifying the number of shares to be converted and (ii) the certificate or certificates representing such shares. Such Notice of Conversion, once delivered to the Transfer Agent, shall be irrevocable.

A Conversion shall be deemed to have been consummated immediately prior to the close of business on the date the Transfer Agent receives the Notice of Conversion of the holder of Class A Common Shares electing to make such Conversion (the "Conversion Date"), or if the Conversion Date is not a business day, then the next business day, and as of such date such holder shall be deemed to be a holder of record of the number of shares of Class B Exchangeable Shares issuable upon such Conversion in accordance with this Article 18 notwithstanding that the share register of the Corporation may then be closed or that a certificate or certificates representing such shares of Class B Exchangeable Shares shall not then actually be issued or delivered to such holder.  


18.2

 Upon any Conversion the holder of shares of Class A Exchangeable Shares being converted shall receive a number of shares of Class B Exchangeable Shares equal to the product of the number of shares of Class A Exchangeable Shares being converted and the Conversion Ratio then in effect. The Conversion Ratio shall initially be one (1), and shall in all events be equitably adjusted in the event of any recapitalization of the Corporation by means of a stock dividend on, or a stock split or combination of, outstanding Class A Exchangeable Shares or Class B Exchangeable Shares, or in the event of any merger, consolidation or other reorganization of the Corporation with another corporation.  


18.3

 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the delivery of any shares of Class B Exchangeable Shares that the Transfer Agent is obligated to deliver on behalf of the Corporation pursuant to any Conversion, the Transfer Agent and the Corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and provincial laws and regulations which require action to be taken by the Transfer Agent and the Corporation in connection with such Conversion.

Appendix II to Plan of Arrangement

  

 _Summary of Principal Terms of the Corporation\'s Preferred Shares_

  

The attributes of the various classes of Preferred Shares will be as follows:

  

 

 (a)

 Each class of Preferred Shares will have a fixed liquidation amount as follows:  

 

 (i)

 Class A Preferred Shares: The fair market value of a share of Coors Class A Common Stock immediately before the Effective Time;  


(ii)

 Class B1 Preferred Shares: $x;  


(iii)

 Class B2 Preferred Shares: The fair market value of a share of Coors Class B Common Stock immediately before the Effective Time, less $x; 
 

 

  

in each case, plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid Fixed Dividends
(defined below) (the total being the "Liquidation Amount").

  

 

 (b)

 Each class of Preferred Shares will be entitled to dividends in an amount equal to 0.01% of their Liquidation Amount per annum (the "Fixed Dividend"), plus an additional amount equal to an amount corresponding to dividends paid by the Corporation on its common shares (i.e., a class of Preferred Shares will, in addition to the Fixed Dividend, be entitled to a per share dividend equal to the per share dividend on the common shares multiplied by the number of common shares a class of the particular class of Preferred Shares would have converted into immediately after the Effective Time).  


(c)

 Each class of Preferred Shares will be redeemable by the Corporation at any time at its option for an amount equal to their Liquidation Amount.  


(d)

 On a reduction of capital by the Corporation, each class of Preferred Shares is limited to receiving its Liquidation Amount, and the Liquidation Amount is thereafter reduced by the amount of such reduction of capital.  


(e)

 Each class of Preferred Shares is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into a number of common shares of the Corporation determined by dividing the Liquidation Amount of the class of Preferred Shares by the fair market value of the common shares at the time of conversion. The common shares to be so issued will be non-voting common shares in the case of a conversion of Class A Preferred Shares or Class B1 Preferred Shares and have equivalent voting rights to the Class B2 Preferred Shares in the case of a conversion of the Class B2 Preferred Shares.  


(f)

 The Class A Preferred Shares and the Class B1 Preferred Shares will be non-voting. The Class B2 Preferred Shares will have one vote per share and, together with any common shares into which they are convertible, the exclusive right to elect 25% of the number of directors of the Corporation (with any fractional number being rounded up).  


(g)

 The Preferred Shares will rank after the Exchangeable Shares but before the Common Shares on liquidation or winding-up.  


(h)

 The Preferred Shares will rank before the Exchangeable Shares and Common Shares in respect of dividends, subject to the entitlement of holders of Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Article 3 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions.

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF VOTING 
 TRUST CERTIFICATES OR OF ANY BENEFICIAL 
 INTERESTS HEREUNDER

  

    Section 8.01. _ Nature of Restrictions. _ No beneficial
interests in any Trust Shares, whether or not represented by Certificates
issued pursuant to this Agreement, may be Transferred, except that (i) a
Beneficiary may transfer all or a portion of its beneficial interest in Trust
Shares to (A) the Permitted Family Transferees of such Beneficiary (in which
event, as a condition to such transfer, if the Transferor was a Molson Family
Group Beneficiary, the Transferor shall cause the Transferee thereupon to
become a signatory hereto and the Transferee will thereupon become a Molson
Family Group Beneficiary and if the Transferor was a Coors Family Group
Beneficiary, the Transferor shall cause the Transferee thereupon to become
signatory hereto and the Transferee will thereupon become a Coors Family
Group Beneficiary) or (B) any other Beneficiary hereunder (collectively, the
"Permitted Transferees"), subject to the further condition that the Trust
Shares subject to such Transfer shall remain in trust pursuant to this
Agreement and no such Transfer shall be valid unless the transferee consents
in writing to be bound as a Beneficiary hereunder and (ii) a Beneficiary may
make a disposition in accordance with Section 8.02 hereof.

   

    
 Section 8.02. _ Third Party Transfers. _ A Beneficiary may Transfer its beneficial interest in Trust Shares to one or more third party transferees other than a Permitted Transferee (each, a "Third Party 

        

Transferee");  _provided_ , that prior to such Transfer such Trust Shares are
converted as permitted pursuant to Article Sixth of the Company\'s
Certificate of Incorporation so that the Third Party Transferee receives only
shares of Class B Common Stock. Such conversion and Transfer shall be effected
by the transferring Beneficiary\'s Beneficiary Representative causing the
Trustee, in accordance with Section 3.05, to take such actions as are required
by such section to effect such conversion and Transfer and to release such
Trust Shares (and the shares of Class B Common Stock issued upon conversion
thereof) from the Trust created hereby, whereupon such shares shall no longer
be subject to this Agreement. Following such Transfer, this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect with respect to all other Trust Shares not
subject to such Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement (including this Section 8.02), each Molson Family Group Beneficiary
agrees that it shall not be permitted to make a Transfer of its beneficial
interests in Trust Shares under this Section 8.02 nor convert any Trust
Shares to Class B Common Stock if, giving effect to such Transfer or the
requisite conversion, the remaining Trust Shares, together with any Class A
Exchangeable Shares subject to the Canadian Voting Trust Agreement (and
associated rights), would constitute in the aggregate less than 50.1% of the
aggregate voting power of all then-outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class
A Exchangeable Shares (and associated rights) unless, at any time prior to
such Transfer or conversion, the number of Trust Shares of the Coors Family
Group Beneficiaries is less than the number (as adjusted by any stock split,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transactions of
Trust Shares initially deposited by the Coors Holder on the date hereof as a
result of one or more Transfers (and associated conversion into Class B Common
Stock) of Trust Shares to a Third Party Transferee.

  

    
 Section 8.03. _ Agreement Not to Cause Conversion Right. _ The Beneficiaries agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) no Beneficiary shall be permitted to make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any beneficial interest in any Trust Shares if, as a result thereof, any shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company shall become convertible into Shares pursuant to the provisions of Article Fifth of the Company\'s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, (ii) in no event shall any Transfer be made or offer deemed made pursuant to Section 8.02 if such Transfer or offer or an acceptance of such offer would constitute or require an "Exclusionary Offer" (as defined in Article Fifth of the Company\'s Restated Certificate of Incorporation), (iii) unless otherwise expressly instructed in writing unanimously by each of the Beneficiary Representatives in connection with the occurrence of an "Exclusionary Offer" (as defined in Article Fifth of the Company\'s Restated Certificate of Incorporation), the Trustee is hereby specifically empowered and directed to deliver any and all certificates and other documents pursuant to such Article Fifth as may be necessary or advisable to prevent the Class B Common Stock from becoming convertible into Shares pursuant to such Article Fifth and (iv) no Beneficiary shall be permitted to take any actions contrary to any certificate that has been delivered to the Company pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of Article Fifth of the Company\'s Restated Certificate of Incorporation (a "Blocking Certificate") or that would cause any Blocking Certificate to be untrue or invalid. Without limiting any of the foregoing, the Trustee acknowledges and advises the Beneficiaries that it has delivered to the Company a Blocking Certificate, and the Trustee further agrees not to rescind or withdraw such Blocking Certificate without the prior written consent of each Beneficiary Representative. If necessary to maintain the effectiveness of the Blocking Certificate following a permitted Transfer hereunder, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company an additional or replacement Blocking Certificate. 

  

    
 Section 8.04. _ Legend. _ Each Beneficiary agrees that all Certificates now held or hereafter obtained by him shall have endorsed upon them a legend substantially in the form set forth in Section 3.07.

 Coors will not without prior approval of Exchangeco and the prior approval of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section 10.2 of the Share Provisions:  

 

 (i)

 issue or distribute Corresponding Coors Shares (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Shares) to the holders of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Shares by way of stock dividend or other distribution, other than an issue of Corresponding Coors Shares (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Shares) to holders of Corresponding Coors Shares who exercise an option to receive dividends in Corresponding Coors Shares (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Shares) in lieu of receiving cash dividends; or  


(ii)

 issue or distribute rights, options or warrants to the holders of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Shares entitling them to subscribe for or to purchase Corresponding Coors Shares (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Shares); or  


(iii)

 issue or distribute to the holders of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Shares (A) shares or securities of Coors of any class other than Corresponding Coors Shares (other than shares convertible into or exchangeable for or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Shares), (B) rights, options or warrants other than those referred to in section 2.7(a)(ii) above, (C) evidences of indebtedness of Coors or (D) assets of Coors, 
 

 

    

unless the economic equivalent on a per share basis of such rights, options,
securities, shares, evidences of indebtedness or other assets is issued or
distributed simultaneously to holders of the affected class of Exchangeable
Shares; provided that, for greater certainty, the above restrictions shall not
apply to any securities issued or distributed by Coors in order to give effect
to and to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and in accordance
with, the Combination Agreement.

   

 (b)

 Coors will not without the prior approval of Exchangeco and the prior approval of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section 10.2 of the Share Provisions:  

 

 (i)

 subdivide, redivide or change the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Shares into a greater number of Corresponding Coors Shares; or  


(ii)

(iii)

 reclassify or otherwise change Corresponding Coors Shares or effect an amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other transaction affecting Corresponding Coors Shares, 
 

 

      

     

unless the same or an economically equivalent change shall simultaneously be
made to, or in the rights of the holders of, the affected class of
Exchangeable Shares.

   

 (c)

 Coors will ensure that the record date for any event referred to in section 2.7(a) or 2.7(b) above, or (if no record date is applicable for such event) the effective date for any such event, is not less than five Business Days after the date on which such event is declared or announced by Coors (with contemporaneous notification thereof by Coors to Exchangeco).  


(d)

 The Board of Directors of Exchangeco shall determine, in good faith and in its sole discretion with assistance of such reputable and qualified financial advisors and/or such experts as the Board of Directors of Exchangeco may require, economic equivalence for the purposes of any event referred to in section 2.7(a) or 2.7(b) above and each such determination shall be conclusive and binding on Coors. In making each such determination, the following factors shall, without excluding other factors determined by the Board of Directors of Exchangeco to be relevant, be considered by the Board of Directors of Exchangeco:  

 

 (i)

 in the case of any stock dividend or other distribution payable in Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, the number of such shares issued in proportion to the number of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock previously outstanding;  


(ii)

 in the case of the issuance or distribution of any rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock), the relationship between the exercise price of each such right, option or warrant and the Current Market Price of Corresponding Coors Common Stock;  


(iii)

 in the case of the issuance or distribution of any other form of property (including without limitation any shares or securities of Coors of any class other than Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, any rights, options or warrants other than those referred to in section 2.7(d)(ii) above, any evidences of indebtedness of Coors or any assets of Coors), the relationship between the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of Exchangeco in the manner above contemplated) of such property to be issued or distributed with respect to each outstanding Share of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock and the Current Market Price of Corresponding Coors Common Stock;  


(iv)

 in the case of any subdivision, redivision or change of the then outstanding Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock into a greater number of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock or the reduction, combination, consolidation or change of the then outstanding Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock into a lesser number of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock or any amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other transaction affecting Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, the effect thereof upon the then outstanding Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock; and  


(v)

 in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of the relevant event to beneficial owners of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares to the extent that such consequences may differ from the general taxation consequences to such beneficial owners determined as if they beneficially owned Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock at the relevant time as a result of differences between taxation laws of Canada and the United States (except for any differing consequences arising as a result of differing 
 

 

      

    

marginal taxation rates and without regard to the individual circumstances of
beneficial owners of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares).

    

 (e)

 Exchangeco agrees that, to the extent required, upon due notice from Coors, Exchangeco will use its best efforts to take or cause to be taken such steps as may be necessary for the purposes of ensuring that appropriate dividends are paid or other distributions are made by Exchangeco, or subdivisions, redivisions or changes are made to the Corresponding Exchangeable Shares, in order to implement the required economic equivalence with respect to the Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock and Corresponding Exchangeable Shares as provided for in this section 2.7. 
 

  

2.8 Tender Offers

  

 

 (a)

 For so long as Exchangeable Shares remain outstanding (not including Exchangeable Shares held by Coors and its Affiliates):  

 

 (i)

 No tender offer, share exchange offer, issuer bid, take-over bid or similar transaction with respect to Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock (an "Offer") will be proposed or recommended by Coors or the Board of Directors of Coors or otherwise effected with the consent or approval of the Board of Directors of Coors unless the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its Affiliates) participate in such Offer to the same extent and on an economically equivalent basis as the holders of Coors Class A Common Stock and Coors Class B Common Stock, without discrimination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except in order to permit the Board of Directors of Coors to fulfill its fiduciary duties under applicable law, neither Coors nor the Board of Directors of Coors will approve or recommend any Offer or take any action in furtherance of an Offer unless the holders of Exchangeable Shares may participate in such Offer without being required to retract Exchangeable Shares as against Exchangeco.  


(ii)

 In the case of an Offer or an Exclusionary Offer, Coors will use its commercially reasonable efforts expeditiously and in good faith to put in place procedures or to cause the Transfer Agent to put in place procedures to ensure that holders of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares may participate in each such Offer without being required to retract Corresponding Exchangeable Shares as against Exchangeco (or, if so required, to ensure that any such retraction shall be conditional upon and shall only be effective if the Corresponding Coors Common Stock tendered or deposited under such Offer is taken up). 
 

 

  

2.9 Ownership of Outstanding Shares

  

 Without the prior approval of Exchangeco and the prior approval of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section 10.2 of the Share Provisions, Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that, as long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares are owned by any Person other than Coors or any of its Affiliates, Coors will be and remain the direct or indirect beneficial owner of no less than two thirds of all issued and outstanding voting shares in the capital of Exchangeco and Callco. 

  

2.10 Coors and Affiliates Not to Vote Exchangeable Shares

  

 Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that it will appoint and cause to be appointed proxyholders with respect to all Exchangeable Shares held by it and its Affiliates for the sole purpose of attending each meeting of holders of a class of Exchangeable Shares in order to be counted as part of the quorum for each such meeting. Coors further covenants and agrees that it will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, exercise any voting rights which may be exercisable by holders of 

        
  

Exchangeable Shares from time to time pursuant to the Share Provisions or
pursuant to the provisions of the CBCA (or any successor or other corporate
statute by which Exchangeco may in the future be governed) with respect to
any Exchangeable Shares held by it or by its Affiliates in respect of any
matter considered at any meeting of holders of Exchangeable Shares.

   

2.11 Rule 10b-18 Purchases

  

 For certainty, nothing contained in this Agreement, including without limitation the obligations of Coors contained in section 2.8 hereof, shall limit the ability of Coors or Exchangeco to make a "Rule 10b-18 Purchase" of Shares pursuant to Rule 10b-18 of the United States _Securities Exchange Act of 1934_ , as amended. 

  

2.12 Canadian Reporting Issuer Status

  

 Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that, as long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares are owned by any Person other than Coors or any of its Affiliates, Coors will use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to maintain Exchangeco\'s status as a reporting issuer in good standing under the _Securities Act_ (Quebec) and equivalent securities legislation in all provinces and territories of Canada and (ii) to maintain Exchangeco\'s qualification to file a prospectus in the form of a short form prospectus in every province and territory of Canada under National Instrument 44-101 ("NI 44-101") of the Canadian Securities Administrators or any instrument, policy or rule in any province or territory of Canada which replaces NI 44-101, provided that such qualification can be maintained substantially through the provision of the continuous disclosure and financial reporting information of Coors as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 

  

2.13 Solvency of Exchangeco

  

 Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that, prior to the Effective Time and thereafter for so long as any Exchangeable Shares are owned by any Person other than Coors or its Affiliates, Coors shall give due regard to taking such necessary action within its control (including taking into account the interests of the holders of Exchangeable Shares) to ensure that at all times during such period Exchangeco shall meet the solvency tests under the CBCA prescribed in respect of the declaration or payment of dividends and the redemption of its shares (provided Coors meets any such comparable tests at such time). 

  

2.14 Canadian Tax Status

  

 

 (a)

 Coors hereby represents and warrants in favour of Exchangeco that it is not a "specified financial institution" ("SFI") (assuming Molson itself is not an SFI at the Effective Date) or a "foreign investment entity", both within the meaning of the ITA (assuming the enactment into law and the proclamation into force of proposed sections 94.1 to 94.4 and related provisions as contained in the October 30, 2003 Notice of Ways and Means Motion), nor a "United States real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the _United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986_ , as amended.  


(b)

 Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that, following the Effective Time and while any Exchangeable Shares (other than any Exchangeable Shares owned by Coors or any of its Affiliates) are outstanding, (i) Coors will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that Exchangeco (or any successor thereto as the issuer of the Exchangeable Shares) will continue to be a "taxable Canadian corporation" and a "public corporation" within the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definitions which are consistent with the general principle thereof), and (ii) Coors will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Exchangeable Shares are listed on a "prescribed stock exchange in Canada" within 
 

      

   

the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of
such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof).

   

 (c)

 Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that as long as there are any Exchangeable Shares outstanding (other than Exchangeable Shares held by Coors or any of its Affiliates), and if required to cause Exchangeable Shares not to be "foreign property" within the meaning of subsection 206(1) of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof), Coors shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Exchangeco to maintain a substantial presence in Canada for purposes of subsection 206(1.1) of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such concept which are consistent with the general principle thereof).  


(d)

 Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that, so long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares are owned by an Original Significant Exchangeable Shareholder, it will take all steps within its control necessary to ensure that it will not become an SFI within the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof). This covenant will not prevent Coors or an Affiliate from effecting an acquisition of or merger or combination with another corporation where (a) each Original Significant Exchangeable Shareholder consents in writing to such merger or acquisition, (b) Coors indemnifies each Original Significant Exchangeable Shareholder on an after-tax basis for any losses arising from Coors becoming an SFI within the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof), or (c) Coors ensures that it is not an SFI within the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principles thereof) from and after the earlier of (i) 60 days following the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to such merger, combination or acquisition, and (ii) the date of payment of the first dividend on the Exchangeable Shares following the entering into of such definitive agreement. For the purpose of the foregoing, an "Original Significant Exchangeable Shareholder" is a shareholder who (i) pursuant to the Arrangement, received, and (ii) at any subsequent time when its status as an Original Significant Exchangeable Shareholder is being determined, holds more than 10% of the shares of any class of Exchangeable Shares, and all of the Exchangeable Shares owned by (1) such Person, (2) any other Person with whom the shareholder does not deal at arm\'s length for purposes of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof) and (3) any trust of which the shareholder is a beneficiary, have an aggregate fair market value of at least $25,000,000. This covenant does not apply to the extent that Molson is an SFI within the meaning of the ITA as at the Effective Date.  


(e)

 Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that, so long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares or Coors Stock are owned by any Original Significant Canadian Shareholder, it will take all steps within its control necessary to ensure that it will not become a "foreign investment entity" within the meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time (assuming the enactment into law and the proclamation into force of proposed sections 94.1 to 94.4 and related provisions as contained in the October 30, 2003 Notice of Ways and Means Motion) and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof). This covenant will not prevent Coors or an Affiliate from undertaking any business or activity where each Original Significant Canadian Shareholder consents in writing to such business or activity. For the purpose of the foregoing, an "Original Significant Canadian Shareholder" is a shareholder who (i) pursuant to the Arrangement, received, and (ii) at any subsequent time when its status as an Original Significant Canadian Shareholder is being determined, holds, more than 10% of the shares of any class of Exchangeable Shares or 
 

      

   

Coors Stock (including for this purpose any shares held by a Person with whom
the shareholder does not deal at arm\'s length for purposes of the ITA (as of
the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are
consistent with the general principle thereof) or any shares of any class of
Exchangeable Shares or Coors Stock in which there are fewer than 150 holders
each holding Cdn$500 worth of shares.

   

 (f)

 Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco to cause Exchangeco to elect under section 191.2 of the ITA in respect of the Exchangeable Shares.  


(g)

 Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that so long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares are owned by any Person other than Coors or any of its Affiliates, Coors shall not, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to not, take any action relating to a plan or agreement of complete or partial liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, merger, consolidation, continuation, change of residence, amalgamation, restructuring, recapitalization or other material reorganization of Exchangeco or its successors or Callco or its successors, as the case may be, that results, prior to a Redemption Date, in (i) the recognition under the ITA (or the provincial equivalent) of any accrued gain on a holder\'s Exchangeable Shares, recognition of which was deferred on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Combination Agreement, (ii) dividends on the Exchangeable Shares being ineligible for the dividend gross-up and tax credit under the ITA (or the provincial equivalent) for individuals resident in Canada for purposes of the ITA and the inter-corporate dividend deduction under the ITA (or the provincial equivalent) for corporations resident in Canada for purposes of the ITA, or (iii) dividends on the Exchangeable Shares being subject to withholding tax (other than withholding tax imposed under the laws of Canada or the United States or a state, province, territory or other political subdivision thereof). References in this clause to the ITA shall be to the ITA as of the Effective Time and any modifications thereof which are consistent with the general principle thereof.  


(h)

 Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco that it will take all steps within its control necessary to ensure that it will not become a "United States real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. 
 

  

2.15 Safe Income Transaction

  

 In connection with requests relating to the future crystallizations of "safe income" attaching to the Exchangeable Shares held and beneficially owned by a holder resident in Canada for purposes of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such concept which are consistent with the general purpose thereof) (the "Requesting Shareholder"), Coors agrees to consider such requests in good faith with a view toward accommodating reasonable requests and undertakes no more frequently than annually to provide to its auditors financial information relating thereto, and to instruct its auditors to provide to the Requesting Shareholder a calculation of "safe income" reasonably arrived at (the "Safe Income Computation"). Such calculation shall be based on a statement of methodology to be provided by the Requesting Shareholder in sufficient detail to enable the auditors to provide such calculation in an efficient manner. The Requesting Shareholder will assume all costs and expenses relating to the Safe Income Computation and acknowledges that neither Coors nor Exchangeco is in any way liable for the accuracy or completeness of the Safe Income Computation or for the correctness or suitability of the methodology provided by the Requesting Shareholder. The Requesting Shareholder will be required to acknowledge that any information furnished by Coors or Exchangeco in connection with the Safe Income Computation is confidential and to undertake not to disclose such information without the prior written approval of Coors, not to be unreasonably withheld. 

        
  

2.16 Indemnity

  

 Coors covenants and agrees in favour of Exchangeco to indemnify and hold holders of Exchangeable Shares harmless from and against any claims, demands, actions, causes of action, judgments, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses (including interest, penalties and reasonable attorneys\' and experts\' fees and disbursements) which are made against or incurred by such holders of Exchangeable Shares in their capacity as shareholders of Exchangeco primarily as a result of, arising out of or relating to the fact that Exchangeco has been or is an operating subsidiary of Coors rather than a special purpose vehicle.

During the term of the Trust and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Trustee shall possess and be vested with all rights in respect of the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights and shall be entitled to exercise all of the rights and powers of an owner with respect to the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights, provided that the Trustee shall: 

  

 

 (a)

 hold the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights as trustee solely for the use and benefit of the Beneficiaries in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; and  


(b)

 except as specifically authorized by this Agreement, have no power or authority to exercise or otherwise deal in or with the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights, and the Trustee shall not exercise any such rights for any purpose other than the purposes for which the Trust is created pursuant to this Agreement.

5.2 Legended Share Certificates

  

 Exchangeco will cause each certificate representing Exchangeable Shares to bear an appropriate legend notifying the Beneficiaries of: 

  

 

 (a)

 their right to instruct the Trustee with respect to the exercise of the Exchange Right in respect of the Exchangeable Shares held by a Beneficiary; and  


(b)

 the Automatic Exchange Rights. 
 

  

5.3 General Exercise of Exchange Right

  

 The Exchange Right shall be and remain vested in and exercisable by the Trustee. Subject to section 7.15, the Trustee shall exercise the Exchange Right only on the basis of instructions received pursuant to this Article 5 from Beneficiaries entitled to instruct the Trustee as to the exercise thereof. To the extent that no instructions are received from a Beneficiary with respect to the Exchange Right, the Trustee shall not exercise or permit the exercise of the Exchange Right. 

   

5.4 Purchase Price

  

 The purchase price payable by Coors for each Exchangeable Share to be purchased by Coors under the Exchange Right shall be an amount per share equal to (a) the Current Market Price of a share of Corresponding Coors Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the day of closing of 

        
  

the purchase and sale of such Exchangeable Share under the Exchange Right,
which shall be satisfied in full by Coors sending or causing to be sent to the
Trustee on behalf of such holder one share of Corresponding Coors Common
Stock, plus (b) to the extent not paid by Exchangeco on the designated payment
date therefor, an additional amount equal to and in satisfaction of the full
amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share
held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the
closing of the purchase and sale. In connection with each exercise of the
Exchange Right, Coors shall provide to the Trustee an Officer\'s Certificate
setting forth the calculation of the purchase price for each Exchangeable
Share. The purchase price for each such Exchangeable Share so purchased may
be satisfied only by Coors issuing and delivering or causing to be delivered
to the Trustee, on behalf of the relevant Beneficiary, one share of Coors
Common Stock and on the applicable payment date a cheque for the balance, if
any, of the purchase price without interest (less any amounts withheld
pursuant to section 5.13). Upon payment by Coors of such purchase price, the
relevant Beneficiary shall cease to have any right to be paid any amount in
respect of declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share by
Exchangeco.

  

5.5 Exercise Instructions

  

 Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, a Beneficiary shall be entitled, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Insolvency Event, to instruct the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with respect to all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such Beneficiary on the books of Exchangeco. To cause the exercise of the Exchange Right by the Trustee, the Beneficiary shall deliver to the Trustee, in person or by certified or registered mail, at its principal office in [Montreal] or at such other places in Canada as the Trustee may from time to time designate by written notice to the Beneficiaries, the certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which such Beneficiary desires Coors to purchase, duly endorsed in blank for transfer, and accompanied by such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the Act and the by-laws of Exchangeco and such additional documents and instruments as the Trustee, Exchangeco and Coors may reasonably require together with (a) a duly completed form of notice of exercise of the Exchange Right, contained on the reverse of or attached to the Exchangeable Share certificates, stating (i) that the Beneficiary thereby instructs the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right so as to require Coors to purchase from the Beneficiary the number of Exchangeable Shares specified therein, (ii) that such Beneficiary has good title to and owns all such Exchangeable Shares to be acquired by Coors free and clear of all liens, hypothecs, claims and encumbrances, (iii) the names in which the certificates representing Shares of Coors Common Stock issuable in connection with the exercise of the Exchange Right are to be issued and (iv) the names and addresses of the persons to whom such new certificates should be delivered and (b) payment (or evidence satisfactory to the Trustee, Exchangeco and Coors of payment) of the taxes (if any) payable as contemplated by section 5.8 of this Agreement. If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate or certificates delivered to the Trustee are to be purchased by Coors under the Exchange Right, a new certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at the expense of Exchangeco. 

  

5.6 Delivery of Coors Common Stock; Effect of Exercise

  

 Promptly after the receipt of the certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which the Beneficiary desires Coors to purchase under the Exchange Right, together with such documents and instruments of transfer and a duly completed form of notice of exercise of the Exchange Right (and payment of taxes, if any payable as contemplated by section 5.8 or evidence thereof), duly endorsed for transfer to Coors, the Trustee shall notify Coors and Exchangeco of its receipt of the same, which notice to Coors and Exchangeco shall constitute exercise of the Exchange Right by the Trustee on behalf of the holder of such Exchangeable Shares, and Coors shall promptly thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee, for delivery to the Beneficiary of such Exchangeable Shares (or to such 

        
  

other persons, if any, properly designated by such Beneficiary) the number of
shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock issuable in connection with the
exercise of the Exchange Right, and on the applicable payment date cheques
for the balance, if any, of the total purchase price therefor without interest
(less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 5.13); provided, however, that
no such delivery shall be made unless and until the Beneficiary requesting
the same shall have paid (or provided evidence satisfactory to the Trustee,
Exchangeco and Coors of the payment of) the taxes (if any) payable as
contemplated by section 5.8 of this Agreement. Immediately upon the giving of
notice by the Trustee to Coors and Exchangeco of the exercise of the Exchange
Right as provided in this section 5.6, the closing of the transaction of
purchase and sale contemplated by the Exchange Right shall be deemed to have
occurred and the holder of such Exchangeable Shares shall be deemed to have
transferred to Coors all of such holder\'s right, title and interest in and to
such Exchangeable Shares and the related interest in the Trust Estate free and
clear of any lien, hypothec, claim or encumbrance and shall cease to be a
holder of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any
of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right to
receive his proportionate part of the total purchase price therefor, unless
the requisite number of shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock is not
allotted, issued and delivered by Coors to the Trustee within five Business
Days of the date of the giving of such notice by the Trustee or the balance of
the purchase price, if any, is not paid by Coors on the applicable payment
date therefor, in which case the rights of the Beneficiary shall remain
unaffected until such shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock are so
allotted, issued and delivered, and the balance of the purchase price, if
any, has been paid, by Coors. Upon delivery by Coors to the Trustee of such
shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock, and the balance of the purchase
price, if any, the Trustee shall deliver Corresponding Coors Common Stock to
such Beneficiary (or to such other persons, if any, properly designated by
such Beneficiary). Concurrently with such Beneficiary ceasing to be a holder
of Exchangeable Shares, the Beneficiary shall be considered and deemed for
all purposes to be the holder of the shares of Corresponding Coors Common
Stock delivered to it pursuant to the Exchange Right.

  

5.7 Exercise of Exchange Right Subsequent to Retraction

  

 In the event that a Beneficiary has exercised its right under Article 6 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions to require Exchangeco to redeem any or all of the Exchangeable Shares held by the Beneficiary (the "Retracted Shares") and is notified by Exchangeco pursuant to section 6.6 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions that Exchangeco will not be permitted as a result of solvency requirements of applicable law to redeem all such Retracted Shares, and provided that Callco shall not have exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares and that the Beneficiary has not revoked the retraction request delivered by the Beneficiary to Exchangeco pursuant to section 6.1 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions and provided further that the Trustee has received written notice of same from Exchangeco or Coors, the retraction request will constitute and will be deemed to constitute notice from the Beneficiary to the Trustee instructing the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with respect to those Retracted Shares that Exchangeco is unable to redeem. In any such event, Exchangeco hereby agrees with the Trustee and in favour of the Beneficiary promptly to forward or cause to be forwarded to the Trustee all relevant materials delivered by the Beneficiary to Exchangeco or to the transfer agent of the Exchangeable Shares (including without limitation, a copy of the retraction request delivered pursuant to section 6.1 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions) in connection with such proposed redemption of the Retracted Shares and the Trustee will thereupon exercise the Exchange Right with respect to the Retracted Shares that Exchangeco is not permitted to redeem and will require Coors to purchase such shares in accordance with the provisions of this Article 5\. 

        
  

5.8 Stamp or Other Transfer Taxes

  

 Upon any transfer of Exchangeable Shares to Coors pursuant to the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights, the share certificate or certificates representing Coors Common Stock to be delivered in connection with the payment of the total purchase price therefor shall be issued in the name of the Beneficiary of the Exchangeable Shares so transferred or in such names as such Beneficiary may otherwise direct in writing, provided such direction is received by Coors prior to the time of such shares being issued, without charge to the holder of the Exchangeable Shares so sold; provided, however, that such Beneficiary (a) shall pay (and none of Coors, Exchangeco or the Trustee shall be required to pay) any documentary, stamp, transfer or other taxes that may be payable in respect of any transfer of such Exchangeable Shares to Coors or in respect of the issuance or delivery of such Coors Common Stock to such Beneficiary or any other Person including, without limitation, in the event that Coors Common Stock are being issued or transferred in the name of a clearing service or depositary or a nominee thereof, or (b) shall have evidenced to the satisfaction of the Trustee, Coors and Exchangeco that such taxes, if any, have been paid. 

  

5.9 Notice of Insolvency Event

  

 As soon as practicable following the occurrence of an Insolvency Event or any event that with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would be an Insolvency Event, Exchangeco and Coors shall give written notice thereof to the Trustee. As soon as practicable following the receipt of notice from Exchangeco and Coors of the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, or upon the Trustee becoming aware of an Insolvency Event, the Trustee will mail to each Beneficiary, at the expense of Coors (such funds to be received in advance), a notice of such Insolvency Event in the form provided by Coors, which notice shall contain a brief statement of the rights of the Beneficiaries with respect to the Exchange Right. 

  

5.10 Qualification of Coors Common Stock

  

 Coors covenants that if any shares of Coors Common Stock to be issued and delivered pursuant to the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights require registration or qualification with or approval of or the filing of any document, including any prospectus or similar document, or the taking of any proceeding with or the obtaining of any order, ruling or consent from any governmental or regulatory authority under any Canadian or United States federal, provincial or state law or regulation or pursuant to the rules and regulations of any regulatory authority or the fulfillment of any other Canadian or United States federal, provincial or state legal requirement before such shares may be issued and delivered by Coors to the initial holder thereof or in order that such shares may be freely traded thereafter (other than any restrictions of general application on transfer by reason of a holder being a "control person" of Coors for purposes of Canadian provincial securities law or an "affiliate" of Coors for purposes of United States federal or state securities law), Coors will in good faith expeditiously take all such actions and do all such things as are necessary or desirable to cause such Coors Common Stock to be and remain duly registered, qualified or approved. Coors will in good faith expeditiously take all such actions and do all such things as are reasonably necessary or desirable to cause all Coors Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights to be listed, quoted or posted for trading on all stock exchanges and quotation systems on which outstanding Coors Common Stock have been listed by Coors and remain listed and are quoted or posted for trading at such time. 

  

5.11 Coors Common Stock

  

 Coors hereby represents, warrants and covenants that the Coors Common Stock issuable as described herein will be duly authorized and validly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, hypothec, claim or encumbrance. 

        
  

5.12 Automatic Exchange on Liquidation of Coors

 Coors will give the Trustee written notice of each of the following events at the time set forth below:  

 

 (i)

 in the event of any determination by the Board of Directors of Coors to institute voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up proceedings with respect to Coors or to effect any other distribution of assets of Coors among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, at least 60 days prior to the proposed effective date of such liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or other distribution; and  


(ii)

 as soon as practicable following the earlier of (A) receipt by Coors of notice of, and (B) Coors otherwise becoming aware of, any threatened or instituted claim, suit, petition or other proceedings with respect to the involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Coors or to effect any other distribution of assets of Coors among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, in each case where Coors has failed to contest in good faith any such proceeding commenced in respect of Coors within 30 days of becoming aware thereof.  


 

(b)

 As soon as practicable following receipt by the Trustee from Coors of notice of any event (a "Liquidation Event") contemplated by section 5.12(a)(i) or 5.12(a)(ii) above, the Trustee will give notice thereof to the Beneficiaries. Such notice shall be provided to the Trustee by Coors and shall include a brief description of the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for Coors Common Stock provided for in section 5.12(c).  


(c)

 In order that the Beneficiaries will be able to participate on a _pro rata_ basis with the holders of Coors Common Stock in the distribution of assets of Coors in connection with a Liquidation Event, on the fifth Business Day prior to the effective date (the "Liquidation Event Effective Date") of a Liquidation Event all of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares (other than those held by Coors and its Affiliates) shall be automatically exchanged for corresponding Coors Common Stock. To effect such automatic exchange, Coors shall purchase on the fifth Business Day prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Date each Exchangeable Share then outstanding and held by Beneficiaries, and each Beneficiary shall sell the Exchangeable Shares held by it at such time, free and clear of any lien, hypothec, claim or encumbrance, for a purchase price per share equal to (a) the Current Market Price of a share of Coors Common Stock on the fifth Business Day prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Date, which shall be satisfied in full by Coors issuing to the Beneficiary one share of Coors Common Stock, and (b) to the extent not paid by Exchangeco on the designated payment date therefor, an additional amount equal to and in satisfaction of the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the date of the exchange. Coors shall provide the Trustee with an Officer\'s Certificate in connection with each automatic exchange setting forth the calculation of the purchase price for each Exchangeable Share.  


(d)

 On the fifth Business Day prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Date, the closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for Coors Common Stock shall be deemed to have occurred, and each Beneficiary shall be deemed to have transferred to Coors all of the Beneficiary\'s right, title and interest in and to such Beneficiary\'s Exchangeable Shares and the related interest in the Trust Estate, any right of each such Beneficiary to receive declared and unpaid dividends from Exchangeco shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged and each such Beneficiary shall cease to be a holder of such Exchangeable Shares and Coors shall issue to the Beneficiary the Coors Common Stock issuable upon the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for Coors Common Stock and on the applicable payment date shall deliver to the Trustee for delivery to the Beneficiary 
 

      

   

a cheque for the balance, if any, of the total purchase price for such
Exchangeable Shares without interest, less any amounts withheld pursuant to
section 5.13. Concurrently with such Beneficiary ceasing to be a holder of
Exchangeable Shares, the Beneficiary shall be considered and deemed for all
purposes to be the holder of the Shares of Coors Common Stock issued pursuant
to the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for Shares of Coors Common
Stock and the certificates held by the Beneficiary previously representing the
Exchangeable Shares exchanged by the Beneficiary with Coors pursuant to such
automatic exchange shall thereafter be deemed to represent Shares of Coors
Common Stock issued to the Beneficiary by Coors pursuant to such automatic
exchange. Upon the request of a Beneficiary and the surrender by the
Beneficiary of Exchangeable Share certificates deemed to represent Shares of
Coors Common Stock, duly endorsed in blank and accompanied by
such instruments of transfer as Coors may reasonably require, Coors shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Beneficiary certificates representing
Shares of Coors Common Stock of which the Beneficiary is the holder.

   

  

5.13 Withholding Rights

  

 Coors, Exchangeco and the Trustee shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of Exchangeable Shares or Coors Common Stock such amounts as Coors, Exchangeco or the Trustee is, (i) required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the ITA, the United States _Internal Revenue Code of 1986_ or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case as amended or succeeded or (ii) entitled to deduct and withhold under section 116 of the ITA or any analogous provision of provincial laws. Coors, Exchangeco and the Trustee may act on the advice of counsel with respect to such matters. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the amount so required or entitled to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, Coors, Exchangeco and the Trustee are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Coors, Exchangeco or the Trustee, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement or entitlement and Coors, Exchangeco or the Trustee shall notify the holder thereof and remit to such holder any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale; provided however that nothing in this section 5.13 shall reduce Exchangeco\'s obligations under section 6.1 (h) of the Combination Agreement or section 3.2 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions. References in this section to the ITA are to the ITA as amended from time to time.

 In no case shall Coors or Exchangeco be liable under this indemnity for any claim against any of the Indemnified Parties unless Coors and Exchangeco shall be notified by the Trustee of the written assertion of a claim or of any action commenced against the Indemnified Parties, promptly after any of the Indemnified Parties shall have received any such written assertion of a claim or shall have been served with a summons or other first legal process giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim. Subject to (ii) below, Coors and Exchangeco shall be entitled to participate at their own expense in the defence and, if Coors and Exchangeco so elect at any time after receipt of such notice, either of them may assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce any such claim.

This indemnity shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.

 The [Shareholder] and the Vendors, on a solidary basis, agree to indemnify and save harmless Molson, Coors, Callco, Exchangeco and HoldCo-2 (and their directors and officers, employees, advisors and agents) from all actions, claims, demands, processes, proceedings, losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, Taxes (whether or not such Taxes have been assessed or reassessed as at the date hereof), and any instalments with respect thereto, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, all legal and other professional fees and disbursements, interest, penalties and amounts paid in settlement) (collectively "Liabilities") whether resulting from a breach of contract, by the commission of a fault or otherwise suffered or incurred by Molson, Coors, Callco, Exchangeco or HoldCo-2 (and their directors, officers, employees and agents), the whole to be computed on an after-tax basis, as a result of or arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with: 

  

 

 (a)

 any breach by the [Shareholder] or the Vendors of any representation, warranty, obligation or covenant of the [Shareholder] or the Vendors contained in the Agreement or any certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto;  


(b)

 any Liability sustained, incurred, assumed or acquired by HoldCo-2 on or before, or related to any matter occurring on or before, the purchase of the HoldCo-2 shares hereunder; and  


(c)

 any Liability which would not have been sustained, suffered or incurred by (or which would not have been asserted, threatened or be pending against) HoldCo-2, Molson, Coors, Callco or Exchangeco but for the Reorganization and the Amalgamation or Winding Up including, without limitation, all Liabilities which, as a result of the Reorganization and the Amalgamation or Winding Up, are assumed or incurred by HoldCo-2, Molson, Coors, Callco or Exchangeco. 
 

  
  

Molson agrees to indemnify and save harmless the Vendors (and its directors
or officers, employees and agents) as a result of or arising directly or
indirectly out of or in connection with any breach by Molson of any
representation, warranty, obligation or covenant of Molson contained in this
Agreement.

  

6.2 _ Notice of Claim_ 

  

 In the event that a party to this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") shall become aware of any claim, proceeding or other matter (a "Claim") in respect of which another party to this Agreement (the "Indemnifying Party") agreed to indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify whether the Claim arises as a result of a claim by a person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim") or whether the Claim does not so arise (a "Direct Claim"), and shall also specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent that the information is available) the factual basis for the Claim and the amount of the Claim, if known. If, through the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party does not receive notice of any Claim in time to contest effectively the determination of any liability susceptible of being contested, the 

        
  

Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to set off against the amount claimed by
the Indemnified Party the amount of any Liabilities incurred by the
Indemnifying Party resulting from the Indemnified Party\'s failure to give
such notice on a timely basis.

  

6.3 _ Direct Claims_ 

  

 With respect to any Direct Claim, following receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days to make such investigation of the Claim as is considered necessary or desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Claim, together with all such other information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. If both parties agree at or prior to the expiration of such 30-day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay to the Indemnified Party the full agreed upon amount of the Claim. 

  

6.4 _ Third Party Claims_ 

   

 With respect to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive right, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to contest, settle or pay the amount claimed and to retain counsel and other experts or advisors selected by the Indemnified Party in its sole discretion in connection therewith; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall remain liable for the settlement amount even if any such consent is not obtained for any reason. If the Indemnified Party elects to assume such control, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to participate in the negotiation, settlement or defence of such Third Party Claim. If any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that the Indemnified Party is required by applicable law to make a payment to any person (a "Third Party") with respect to the Third Party Claim before the completion of settlement negotiations or related legal proceedings, the Indemnified Party may make such payment and the Indemnifying Party shall, forthwith after demand by the Indemnified Party, reimburse the Indemnified Party for such payment. If the amount of any liability of the indemnified Party under the Third Party Claim in respect of which such payment was made, as finally determined, is less than the amount that was paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall, forthwith after receipt of the difference from the Third Party, pay the amount of such difference to the Indemnifying Party. 

  

6.5 _ Reduction, Set-off, Payment and Co-operation_ 

  

 The Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party all amounts for which the Indemnifying Party is liable pursuant to this Section 6 promptly after the Indemnified Party incurs the Liability in respect of which such liability arises. If such amount is not so paid, the Indemnified Party may deduct or set-off such amount from any obligation it may have to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall co-operate fully with each other with respect to Third Party Claims, and shall keep each other fully advised with respect thereto (including supplying copies of all relevant documentation promptly as it becomes available).

     WHEREAS:  
--- 
   
A. | 
  | 
  (" _HoldCo-1_ "), and ("
_HoldCo-3_ " and together with HoldCo-1, the " _Vendors_ "), as vendors,
, (the " _[Shareholder]_ ", the Vendors and the [Shareholder] being

issued and outstanding preferred shares of HoldCo-2 in consideration for the
issue and allotment by Molson to HoldCo-3 of fully paid and non-assessable

B. | 
  | 
 A condition to Molson, Coors, Callco and Exchangeco completing the
transactions provided for under the Molson Share Exchange Agreement is that
the Guarantor execute and deliver this guarantee.  
   
C. | 
  | 
 All capitalized terms used but not defined in this guarantee have the
meanings specified in the Molson Share Exchange Agreement.  
     

 THIS GUARANTEE WITNESSES THAT, in consideration for Molson, Coors, Callco and Exchangeco completing the transactions provided for under the Molson Share Exchange Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the Guarantor), the Guarantor agrees to, with and in favour of each of the Creditors as follows: 

  

  

 1. _ Guarantee:_ The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, on a solidary basis, to each of the Creditors the due and punctual payment and performance in full of all present and future indebtedness, liabilities and obligations of each of the Debtors under, pursuant to or in respect of the Molson Share Exchange Agreement and all certificates and documents delivered by each of the Debtors pursuant thereto or in connection therewith (collectively the " _Share Exchange Documents_ ") (including without limitation all such indebtedness, liabilities and obligations arising as a result of, in connection with or in respect of a breach of covenant, or a breach of a representation or warranty, by a Debtor under a Share Exchange Document or arising pursuant to in respect of any indemnity liability or obligation of a Debtor contained in a Share Exchange Document), and any ultimate unpaid balance thereof (collectively the " _Liabilities_ "). 

   

 2. _ Demand for Payment:_ The Guarantor shall from time to time pay to Molson for the account of the Creditors forthwith after written demand on the Guarantor from Molson, at the address specified in such, the amount of the liability of the Guarantor hereunder specified in such demand (the Guarantor acknowledging that Molson may make demand on the Guarantor on its own behalf and on behalf of any one or more of the other Creditors). All amounts payable hereunder by the Guarantor shall be paid in the currency in which the related amounts are owed by the applicable Debtor. The Guarantor hereby waives any and all presentments, demands,     

  
  

notices and protests in the enforcement of this guarantee, other than as may
be required by applicable law.

  

 3. _ Continuing Guarantee:_ This guarantee shall be a continuing guarantee and shall be binding as a continuing obligation of the Guarantor. For all purposes of the liability of the Guarantor hereunder including without limitation the calculation of the amount of the Liabilities at any time, every sum of money which is now or which may hereafter from time to time be due or owing to any Creditor by any Debtor (or would have become so due or owing were it not for the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or winding-up of such Debtor) shall be deemed to be and to continue due and owing to such Creditor until the same shall be actually paid in cash to such Creditor, notwithstanding the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or winding-up of such Debtor or any other event whatsoever. The Guarantor agrees that, if at any time all or any part of any payment previously applied by any Creditor to any of the Liabilities is or must be rescinded or returned by such Creditor for any reason whatsoever (including without limitation the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or winding-up of a Debtor), such Liability shall, for the purpose of this guarantee, to the extent that such payment is or must be rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence, notwithstanding such application by such Creditor, and this guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such Liability, all as though such application had not been made. No assurance, security or payment which may be rescinded or avoided under any law relating to insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or winding-up and no release, settlement, discharge or arrangement which may have been given or made on the faith of any such assurance, security or payment shall prejudice or affect the right of the Creditors to recover from the Guarantor to the full extent of this guarantee as if such assurance, security, payment, release, settlement, discharge or arrangement had never been granted, given or made. Any such release, settlement, discharge or arrangement shall as between the Creditors and the Guarantor, be deemed to have been given or made upon the express condition that it shall become and be wholly void and of no effect if the assurance, security or payment on the faith of which it was made or given shall at any time thereafter be rescinded or avoided as aforesaid, to the intent so that the Creditors shall become and be entitled at any time after any such recission or avoidance to exercise all or any of the rights conferred upon the Creditors hereunder and of all other rights which by virtue and as a consequence of this guarantee the Creditors would have been entitled to exercise but for such release, settlement, discharge or arrangement. 

  

 4. _ Enforcing Rights Against Guarantor:_ The Guarantor hereby waives the benefits of division and discussion. Without limiting the foregoing, no Creditor shall be obliged to take any action or to exhaust any recourse against any Debtor, any other person, or any security held at any time by any Creditor, nor to value any security held by any Creditor, before requiring, or being entitled to, payment from, and to enforce its rights and remedies against, the Guarantor under this guarantee. No Creditor shall be obliged to marshall any assets in favour of the Guarantor. Any third party dealing with any Creditor shall not be concerned to see or inquire as to the validity of any demand under this guarantee. 

  

 5. _ Guarantee Absolute:_ (1) The liability of the Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be released, discharged, diminished, limited or in any way affected by any matter, act, failure to act, or circumstance whatsoever, including without limitation: (a) any lack of enforceability of any agreement between any Creditor and any Debtor or any document provided by any Debtor to any Creditor; (b) any failure on the part of any Debtor to carry out any rights or obligations under any agreement or document; (c) any change in the name, objects, powers, organization, share capital, constating documents, business, shareholders, directors or management of any Debtor; (d) any amalgamation, merger or consolidation of any Debtor into or with any other person or entity, or any sale, lease or transfer of all or any of the assets of any Debtor to any other person or entity; (e) any lack or limitation of power, incapacity or disability 

  

      

  
  

on the part of any Debtor or any of its directors, officers, shareholders,
partners, employees or agents, or any other irregularity, defect or
informality, or any fraud, on the part of any Debtor or any of its directors,
officers, shareholders, employees or agents with respect to any or all of the
Liabilities; (f) any impossibility, impracticability, frustration of purpose,
illegality, force majeure or act of government or governmental authority; (g)
the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, winding-up or financial condition
of any Debtor or any other person at any time; (h) any loss of or in respect
of any security held by or on behalf of any Creditor, whether occasioned
through the fault of a Creditor or otherwise; (i) any law,
regulation, limitation period or other matter or circumstance which might
otherwise constitute a defence available to, or a discharge of, a Debtor with
respect to any or all of the Liabilities; (j) any loss or impairment of any
right of the Guarantor to subrogation, reimbursement or contribution, whether
or not as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by any Creditor;
and (k) anything done, omitted to be done, suffered or permitted by any
Creditor in connection with all or any of the Liabilities or otherwise or in
connection with any security held by or on behalf of any Creditor (whether
relating to the Liabilities or otherwise), or which might otherwise operate to
release, discharge, diminish or limit in any way the liability of, or
otherwise provide a defence to, a guarantor or surety.

  

 (2) The Creditors may, with respect to all or any of the Liabilities and without releasing, discharging, limiting or otherwise affecting in whole or in part the Guarantor\'s liability hereunder: (a) amend, alter or vary any of their agreements with any of the Debtors or any other person; (b) grant time, renewals, extensions, indulgences, releases and discharges to any Debtor or any other person; (c) increase or reduce the rate of interest on all or any of the Liabilities; (d) alter, compromise, accelerate, extend or change the time or manner for payment by any Debtor of, or by any other person or persons liable to the Creditors in respect of any or all of the Liabilities; (e) take or abstain from taking security from any Debtor or any other person or from completing or perfecting any security taken; (f) release or add one or more guarantors or sureties, accept additional or substituted security, or release or subordinate any security; (g) accept compromises from any Debtor or any other person; (h) apply all money at any time received from any Debtor or from any person other than the Guarantor or from any security upon such part of the Liabilities as the Creditors may see fit, and change any such application from time to time in their discretion, or keep such money in a separate account for such period as the Creditors may determine without application to the Liabilities; and (i) otherwise deal with the Debtors, the Guarantor and all other persons and security as the Creditors may determine. The Creditors may apply all money at any time received from the Guarantor hereunder upon such part of the Liabilities as the Creditors may see fit, and may change any such application from time to time in their discretion. 

  

 6. _ Indemnity:_ If any amount in respect of the Liabilities is not recoverable from the Guarantor hereunder on the basis of a guarantee, then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof, (a) the Guarantor shall be liable hereunder as principal debtor in respect of the due payment of such amount, and shall pay such amount to Molson for the benefit of the Creditors after demand as herein provided, and (b) the Guarantor shall indemnify and saves each of the Creditors harmless from and against all losses, costs, damages, expenses, claims and liabilities that such Creditor may suffer or incur in connection with or in respect of any failure by the applicable Debtor for any reason to pay or perform any such Liability and shall pay the amount of such loss, cost, damage, expense, claim or liability to Molson for the benefit of the applicable Creditor after written demand for same by Molson. 

  

 7. _ Conclusive Statement:_ Any account settled or stated by or between a Creditor and a Debtor at any time respecting the Liabilities shall be _prima facie_ evidence that the balance or amount thereof appearing due to the applicable Creditor is so due. 

   

 8. _ Stay of Acceleration, etc.:_ If acceleration of the time for payment, or the liability of a Debtor to make any payment, of any amount specified to be payable by a Debtor in respect of the 

  

      

  
  

Liabilities is stayed, prohibited or otherwise affected upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization or winding-up of such Debtor or any moratorium
affecting the payment of the Liabilities by such Debtor, all such amounts
otherwise subject to acceleration or payment shall nonetheless be deemed for
all purposes of this guarantee to be and to become due and payable by
such Debtor and shall be payable by the Guarantor hereunder forthwith after
demand by Molson.

  

 9. _ Subrogation, etc.:_ Until the Liabilities have been paid in full, the Guarantor shall not exercise or enforce any right of subrogation against any Debtor. In case of the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or winding-up of a Debtor (whether voluntary or compulsory) or in the event that a Debtor shall make a bulk sale of any assets or scheme of arrangement with creditors, all dividends and other payments which may be due or payable to the Guarantor are hereby assigned and transferred to and shall be due and paid to Molson for the benefit of the Creditors on account of the Liabilities, and for such payment to Molson this shall be a sufficient warrant and authority to any person making the same. The Guarantor shall continue liable under this guarantee for any balance of the Liabilities which may be owing to the Creditors by a Debtor, and in the event of the valuation by the Creditors of any of their security and/or retention thereof by the Creditors in accordance with the _Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act_ (Canada) or any other applicable legislation, such valuation and/or continuation shall not as between the Creditors and the Guarantor, be considered as a purchase of such security, or as payment or satisfaction or reduction of all or any part of the Liabilities. 

  

 10. _ Amounts Owed by Debtors._ All present and future indebtedness and liabilities of each of the Debtors to the Guarantor are, effective from and after the date of any demand under this guarantee, postponed and subordinated to the full and final payment of all Liabilities, and until otherwise agreed in writing by the Creditors, all moneys received by the Guarantor in respect of any such indebtedness and liabilities at any such time shall be received as mandatary and agent for the Creditors, shall be kept by the Guarantor separate and apart from its other assets, and shall be paid over to Molson on account of the Liabilities. 

   

 11. _ Alteration or Waiver:_ No alteration or waiver of this guarantee or of any of its terms, provisions or conditions shall be binding on the Creditors unless made in writing by an authorized officer of Molson. No failure on the part of any Creditor to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude the other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. 

  

 12. _ Rights Not Exhaustive:_ All rights, powers and remedies of the Creditors hereunder shall be in addition to all rights, powers and remedies given to the Creditors at law, in equity, under statute, by agreement or otherwise. All such rights, powers and remedies are cumulative and not alternative and shall not be exhausted by any exercise thereof against the Guarantor or by any number of successive actions until and unless all of the Liabilities have been paid and each of the Guarantor\'s obligations hereunder has been fully performed. This guarantee is in addition to and not in substitution for any security held at any time by any of the Creditors. 

  

 13. _ Severability:_ Any provision of this guarantee which is or is deemed to be void, prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be severed from this guarantee with respect to such jurisdiction, without in any way invalidating the remaining provisions of this guarantee and without affecting such provision in any other jurisdiction. 

  

 14. _ Delivery and Completeness of Guarantee:_ Upon this guarantee, bearing the signature of the Guarantor, coming into the possession of Molson, the same shall be deemed to be finally executed and delivered by the Guarantor and shall not be subject to or affected by any promise or condition affecting or limiting the Guarantor\'s liability except as set forth herein, and no statement, representation, agreement or promise on the part of any officer, employee or agent of any Creditor, unless contained herein, forms any part of this guarantee or has induced the making 

  

      

  
  

of this guarantee or shall be deemed in any way to affect the Guarantor\'s
liability hereunder. This guarantee and the Share Exchange Documents
constitute the entire agreement between the Creditors and the Guarantor with
respect to the subject matter hereof and cancels and supersedes any prior
understandings and agreements between them with respect thereto.

   

 15. _ Financial Condition:_ The Guarantor is fully aware of the financial condition of each of the Debtors, has made all inquiries which the Guarantor feels are necessary and acknowledges that the Guarantor has received no information from any Creditor regarding any Debtor or its financial condition.

 (b) The relative rights, privileges and limitations of the shares of each class of Common Stock are as follows: 

  

  

 (1) The Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock shall be identical in all respects, share for share, except with respect to the right to vote and except as otherwise provided in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Special Class A Voting Stock and the Special Class B Voting Stock shall be identical in all respects, share for share, except with respect to the right to vote and except as otherwise provided in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the right to vote for all purposes shall be vested exclusively in the holders of Class A Common Stock and Special Class A Voting Stock (the "Class A Holders"), voting together as a single class as further described in subparagraph (3) below (except as otherwise provided herein or required by applicable law). The holders of 

  

      

  

Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote per share of Class A
Common Stock on each matter for which holders of Class A Common Stock are
entitled to vote.

  

 (2) The holders of Class B Common Stock and Special Class B Voting Stock (the "Class B Holders"), voting together as a single class as further described in subparagraph (4) below, shall be entitled, voting as a class separately from the Class A Holders, to elect at each annual meeting of the Corporation\'s stockholders three (3) members of the board of directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors") but, except where applicable provisions of the DGCL or this Restated Certificate of Incorporation require otherwise, shall otherwise have no right to vote either for the election of directors or for any other purpose. Without limiting the foregoing, except as set forth in paragraph (b) of Article Ninth, the Class B Holders shall have no right to vote on the removal of directors from the Board of Directors. The holders of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote per share of Class B Common Stock on each matter on which holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to vote. Each Class B Holder shall be entitled to receive notice of, and to receive all materials distributed to the stockholders with respect to, and to attend, all meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation (other than with respect to class meetings of holders of Preferred Stock). 

  

 (3) The holder of the Special Class A Voting Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of Class A Common Stock (whether at an annual or special meeting or by written consent), voting together with the holders of Class A Common Stock as a single class (except as otherwise provided herein or required by applicable law), and the holder of the Special Class A Voting Stock shall be entitled to cast on any such matter a number of votes equal to the number of Class A non-voting exchangeable shares ("Exchangeable Class A Shares") of Coors Canada Inc., a Canadian corporation ("Exchangeco"), and its successors-at-law, whether by merger, amalgamation or otherwise, outstanding as of the record date for such annual or special meeting or written consent of stockholders and not belonging to the Corporation or any other entity of which a majority of the shares (or similar interests) entitled to vote in the election of members of the board of directors (or similar governing body) of such other entity is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation (any such entity, a "subsidiary" of the Corporation). At such time as no Exchangeable Class A Shares (other than Exchangeable Class A Shares belonging to the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation) shall be outstanding and there are no shares of stock, debt, options, rights, warrants, or other securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for, or other agreements which could give rise to the issuance of, any Exchangeable Class A Shares to any person (other than the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation), the share of Special Class A Voting Stock shall be automatically redeemed for $0.01, but only out of funds legally available therefor, and upon any such redemption of the Special Class A Voting Stock by the Corporation, the share of Special Class A Voting Stock shall be deemed retired and canceled and may not be reissued. 

  

 (4) The holder of the Special Class B Voting Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of Class B Common Stock (whether at an annual or special meeting), voting together with the holders of Class B Common Stock as a single class (except as otherwise provided herein or required by applicable law), and the holder of the Special Class B Voting Stock shall be entitled to cast on any such matter a number of votes equal to the number of Class B non-voting exchangeable shares ("Exchangeable Class B Shares") of Exchangeco and its successors-at-law, whether by merger, amalgamation or otherwise, outstanding as of the record date for such annual or special meeting of stockholders and not belonging to the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation. At such time as no Exchangeable Class B Shares (other than Exchangeable Class B Shares belonging to the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation) shall be outstanding and there are no shares of stock, debt, options, rights, warrants, or other securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for, or other agreements which could give rise to

the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation), the share of Special
Class B Voting Stock shall be automatically redeemed for $0.01, but only out
of funds legally available therefor, and upon any such redemption of the
Special Class B Voting Stock by the Corporation, the share of Special Class B
Voting Stock shall be deemed retired and canceled and may not be reissued.

   

 (5) The affirmative vote of Class A Holders representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all Class A Holders, voting together as a single class, shall be necessary for effecting the following actions: 

    

 (i) the issuance of (A) any shares of Class A Common Stock (other than pursuant to (x) the conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock pursuant to Article Fifth or (y) the exchange or redemption of Exchangeable Class A Shares pursuant to the terms of such shares) or securities (other than Class B Common Stock) convertible into or exercisable for Class A Common Stock, (B) any shares of Class B Common Stock (other than pursuant to (x) the conversion of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to Article Fifth or Article Sixth or (y) the exchange or redemption of Exchangeable Class B Shares pursuant to the terms of such shares) or securities (other than Class A Common Stock) convertible into or exercisable for Class B Common Stock whether in a single transaction or in a series of related transactions, if the number of shares to be so issued (including upon conversion or exchange) is, or will be upon issuance, equal to or in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding before the issuance of such Class B Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of Class B Common Stock) or (C) any shares of Preferred Stock having any voting rights other than those expressly required by the DGCL; 

  

 (ii) the sale, transfer or other disposition (whether directly by the Corporation or indirectly through any of its subsidiaries) of any capital stock (or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock) of either Molson Inc. or any of its successors (collectively, "Molson") or Coors Brewing Company or any of its successors (collectively, "CBC") or the issuance by Molson or CBC of any shares of its capital stock; provided, however, that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to any such sale, transfer, disposition or issuance of capital stock of Molson or CBC, as the case may be, if, after giving effect thereto, the Corporation continues to own, either directly or together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, 100% of the capital stock of Molson or CBC, as the case may be; 

   

 (iii) the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Molson or CBC (whether directly by Molson or CBC or indirectly through any of their respective subsidiaries, and whether in a single transaction or in a series of related transactions); 

  

 (iv) any decrease in the number of members of the Board of Directors to a number less than fifteen (15); and 

  

 (v) any action to permit or cause any of the actions set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) above. 

    

 (6) The Class A Holders and the Class B Holders shall have the right to vote, as separate classes and not jointly, on (i) any agreement of merger that requires stockholder approval under the DGCL or a statutory share exchange (but only to the extent that the DGCL is hereafter amended to provide for such a statutory share exchange), (ii) any sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation (other than to or with any entity that is directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Corporation) or any sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the property and assets of any entity (A) of which the Corporation is in 

  

      

  

possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of such entity, whether through
ownership of voting shares or interests, by contract or otherwise and (B)
whose shares or other interests held by the Corporation constitute all or
substantially all of the property and assets of the Corporation, (iii) any
proposal to dissolve the Corporation or any proposal to revoke the
dissolution of the Corporation or (iv) any amendment to this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation that requires stockholder approval under this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL and that would (A) increase
or decrease the aggregate number of the authorized shares of Class B Common
Stock; (B) change the designations, preferences, limitations, or relative
rights of any shares of Class B Common Stock; (C) change the shares of all or
part of Class B Common Stock into a different number of shares of the same

deny existing preemptive rights of, or cancel or otherwise affect rights to
distributions or dividends that have accumulated but have not yet been
declared on, any shares of Class B Common Stock. The vote required to approve
the foregoing actions is the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in
voting power of the Class A Holders entitled to vote thereon and the holders
of a majority in voting power of the Class B Holders entitled to vote thereon,
each voting as a separate class and not jointly. For the avoidance of doubt,
for purposes of clause (iv) above, the creation or issuance of any series of
preferred stock pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Article Fourth shall not
be deemed an amendment to this Restated Certificate of Incorporation that
requires stockholder approval pursuant to this subparagraph (6).

  

 (7) Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock and subject to subparagraph (8) below, the holders of Class A Common Stock and the holders of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends (whether payable in cash or otherwise) as shall be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor, except that so long as any shares of Class B Common Stock are outstanding, no dividends shall be declared or paid, in cash or otherwise, on any Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock unless at the same time there shall be declared or paid, as the case may be, a dividend on Class B Common Stock or Class A Common Stock, as applicable, in an amount per share (or, in the case of a dividend declared or paid in the form of shares of Common Stock, a number per share) equal to the amount (or number) per share of the dividend declared or paid on the Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as applicable. 

   

 (8) Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may declare and distribute dividends pro rata to the holders of Class A Common Stock and the holders of Class B Common Stock in the form of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation. Dividends payable in Common Stock to the holders of Class A Common Stock may be made in authorized and unissued shares of Class A Common Stock or in authorized and unissued shares of Class B Common Stock, as the Board of Directors determines. Dividends payable in Common Stock to the holders of Class B Common Stock may be made only in authorized and unissued shares of Class B Common Stock. 

   

 (9) The holder of the Special Class A Voting Stock and the holder of the Special Class B Voting Stock shall not be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions or to receive or participate in any distribution of assets upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 

  

 (10) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (1) and (2) above, at any time when, and only for so long as, the Corporation has no shares of Class A Common Stock and no shares of Special Class A 

  

      

  
  

Voting Stock outstanding, the Class B Holders shall have, without further
action by the Board of Directors or stockholders, the right to vote for the
election of all of the Corporation\'s directors and for all other purposes,
and all references in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation to required
votes of the Class A Holders or to the right of Class A Holders to vote shall
be deemed to refer to the Class B Holders. At such time as the Corporation
reissues one or more shares of Class A Common Stock, the voting rights of the
Class B Holders shall be as set forth in the foregoing subparagraphs and not
in this subparagraph (10).

 The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each series shall include, but not be limited to, determination of the following: 

  

  

 (1) the distinctive serial designation of such series which shall distinguish it from other series; 

  

 (2) the number of shares included in such series;

 (4) whether dividends on the shares of such series shall be cumulative and, in the case of shares of any series having cumulative dividend rights, the date or dates or method of determining the date or dates from which dividends on the shares of such series shall be cumulative; 

  

 (5) the amount or amounts which shall be payable out of the assets of the Corporation to the holders of the shares of such series upon voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up the Corporation, and the relative rights of priority, if any, of payment of the shares of such series; 

  

 (6) the price or prices at which, the period or periods within which and the terms and conditions upon which the shares of such series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Corporation or at the option of the holder or holders thereof or upon the happening of a specified event or events; 

  

 (7) the obligation, if any, of the Corporation to purchase or redeem shares of such series pursuant to a sinking fund or otherwise and the price or prices at which, the period or periods within which and the terms and conditions upon which the shares of such series shall be redeemed or purchased, in whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation; 

   

 (8) whether or not the shares of such series shall be convertible or exchangeable, at any time or times at the option of the holder or holders thereof or at the option of the Corporation or upon the happening of a specified event or events, into shares of any other class or classes or any 

  

      

  
  

other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the
Corporation, and the price or prices or rate or rates of exchange or
conversion and any adjustments applicable thereto; and

   

 (9) subject to subparagraph (b)(5)(i) of this Article Fourth, whether or not the holders of the shares of such series shall have voting rights, in addition to the voting rights required by law, and if so the terms of such voting rights. 

  

  

 The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to vary the provisions relating to the foregoing matters between the various series of Preferred Stock, but, unless otherwise specified in a Preferred Stock Designation, in all other respects the shares of each series shall be of equal rank with each other regardless of series. Notwithstanding the fixing of the number of shares constituting a particular series upon the issuance thereof, unless otherwise specified in the Preferred Stock Designation and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors may at any time thereafter authorize the issuance of additional shares of the same series or may reduce (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) the number of shares constituting such series. 

  

 (d) The number of authorized shares of any class of stock of the Corporation may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Class A Holders, irrespective of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL, without a separate class vote of the class to be increased or decreased; provided, however, that this provision shall not affect the requirement of any vote required pursuant to subparagraph (6) of paragraph (b) of the this Article Fourth or any Preferred Stock Designation.

Upon receipt by the transfer agent of such notice and stock certificate or certificates, the Corporation shall issue or cause to be issued a stock certificate representing fully-paid shares of Class A Common Stock as prescribed above and in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Article Fifth. If less than all of the shares of Class B Common Stock represented by any stock certificate are to be converted, the holder shall be entitled to receive a new stock certificate representing in the aggregate the number of shares of Class B Common Stock represented by the original stock certificate that are not to be converted.

Any such election shall provide that the conversion of Converted Shares into shares of Class B Common Stock pursuant to such election in respect of which the holder exercises his or her right of withdrawal from the Exclusionary Offer shall become effective at the time such right of withdrawal is exercised, and that if the right of withdrawal is not exercised, any conversion into shares of Class B Common Stock pursuant to such election shall become effective: 

  

  

 (1) in respect of an Exclusionary Offer which is completed, immediately following the time by which the Offeror is required under applicable securities laws to purchase and pay for all shares to be acquired by the Offeror under the Exclusionary Offer; and 

  

 (2) in respect of an Exclusionary Offer which is abandoned or withdrawn, at the time at which the Exclusionary Offer is abandoned or withdrawn. 

  

  

 (h) No stock certificates representing Converted Shares or Exchangeable Converted Shares shall be delivered to or to the order of the holders of the shares before such shares are tendered into the Exclusionary Offer; the transfer agent, on behalf of the holders of the Converted Shares or Exchangeable Converted Shares, shall tender pursuant to the Exclusionary Offer a certificate or certificates representing the Converted Shares or Exchangeable Converted Shares. Upon completion of the Exclusionary Offer, the transfer agent shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders entitled thereto all consideration paid by the Offeror pursuant to the Exclusionary Offer in respect of the Converted Shares or Exchangeable Converted Shares. If Converted Shares or Exchangeable Converted Shares are converted into shares of Class B Common Stock in accordance with the election required by paragraph (c) of this Article Fifth or Section 16.3 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, the transfer agent shall deliver to the holders entitled thereto a stock certificate or certificates representing the shares of Class B Common Stock resulting from the conversion. The Corporation shall make all arrangements with the transfer agent necessary or desirable to give effect to this paragraph (d). 

       

 

 (i)

 Subject to paragraph (f) of this Article Fifth, the conversion right provided for in paragraph (b) of this Article Fifth shall not come into effect if: 
 

  
 

  

 (1) prior to the Offer Date there is delivered to the transfer agent and to the Secretary of the Corporation a certificate or certificates signed by or on behalf of one or more stockholders of the Corporation or stockholders of Exchangeco owning, in the aggregate, as of the Offer Date, more than fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Exchangeable Class A Shares, in each case exclusive of shares owned immediately prior to the Offer Date by the Offeror, which certificate or certificates shall confirm, in the case of each such stockholder, that such stockholder shall not: 

    

 (i) tender any shares in acceptance of any Exclusionary Offer without giving the transfer agent and the Secretary of the Corporation written notice of such acceptance or intended acceptance at least seven (7) days prior to the Expiration Date; 

  

 (ii) make any Exclusionary Offer; 

  

 (iii) act jointly or in concert with any person or company that makes any Exclusionary Offer; or 

  

 (iv) transfer any shares of Class A Common Stock or Exchangeable Class A Shares, directly or indirectly, during the time at which any Exclusionary Offer is outstanding without giving the transfer agent and the Secretary of the Corporation written notice of such transfer or intended transfer at least seven (7) days prior to the Expiration Date, which notice shall state, if known to the transferor, the names of the transferees and the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Exchangeable Class A Shares transferred or to be transferred to each transferee; 

    

 (2) as of the end of the seventh (7th) day after the Offer Date there has been delivered to the transfer agent and to the Secretary of the Corporation a certificate or certificates signed by or on behalf of one or more stockholders of the Corporation or stockholders of Exchangeco owning, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Exchangeable Class A Shares, exclusive of shares owned immediately prior to the Offer Date by the Offeror, which certificate or certificates shall confirm, in the case of each such stockholder: 

    

 (i) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Exchangeable Class A Shares owned by the stockholder; 

  

 (ii) that such stockholder is not making the Exclusionary Offer and is not an associate or affiliate of, or acting jointly or in concert with, the person or company making the Exclusionary Offer;

 (3) as of the end of the seventh (7th) day after the Offer Date a combination of certificates that comply with either subparagraph (1) or (2) above from stockholders of the Corporation or stockholders of Exchangeco owning, in the aggregate, more than fifty percent (50%) of the then outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Exchangeable Class A Shares, exclusive of shares owned immediately prior to the Exclusionary Offer by the Offeror, has been delivered to the transfer agent and to the Secretary of the Corporation. 

  

  

 (j) If a notice referred to in clause (e)(1)(i), (e)(1)(iv), (e)(2)(iii) or (e)(2)(iv) is given and the conversion right provided for in paragraph (b) of this Article Fifth has not come into effect, the transfer agent shall either forthwith upon receipt of the notice or forthwith after the seventh (7th) day following the Offer Date, whichever is later, determine the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Exchangeable Class A Shares in respect of which certificates have been delivered that comply with either subparagraph (e)(1) or (e)(2). For the purpose of this determination, (i) certificates in respect of which such a notice has been filed shall not be regarded as delivered insofar as the shares of Class A Common Stock or Exchangeable Class A Shares to which the notice relates are concerned; (ii) the transfer that is the subject of any notice referred to in clause (e)(1)(iv) or (e)(2)(iv) shall be deemed to have already taken place at the time of the determination; and (iii) the transferee in the case of any notice referred to in clause (e)(1)(iv) or (e)(2)(iv) shall be deemed to be a person or company from whom the transfer agent does not have a certificate unless the transfer agent is otherwise advised of the identity of the transferee, either by such notice or by the transferee in writing, and such transferee is a person or company from whom the transfer agent has received delivery of a certificate. If the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Exchangeable Class A Shares so determined to be subject to certificates delivered pursuant to subparagraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the number of then outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Exchangeable Class A Shares, exclusive of shares owned immediately prior to the Offer Date by the Offeror, paragraph (e) of this Article Fifth shall cease to apply and the conversion right provided for in paragraph (b) of this Article Fifth shall be in effect for the remainder of the Conversion Period. 

  

 (k) As soon as reasonably possible after the seventh (7th) day after the Offer Date, the Corporation shall send to each holder of shares of Class B Common Stock with a copy to the trustee under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement entered into with respect to the Exchangeable Class B Shares a notice advising such holders as to whether they are entitled to convert their shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock and the reasons therefor. If such notice discloses that they are not so entitled but it is subsequently determined that they are so entitled by virtue of paragraph (f) of this Article Fifth or otherwise, the Corporation shall forthwith send another notice to the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock advising them of that fact and the reasons therefor. 

  

 (l) If a notice referred to in paragraph (g) of this Article Fifth discloses that the conversion right provided for in paragraph (b) of this Article Fifth has come into effect, the notice shall: 

  

  

 (1) include a description of the procedure to be followed to effect the conversion and to have the Converted Shares tendered under the offer; 

  

 (2) include the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this Article Fifth; and 

  

      

  
  

 (3) be accompanied by a copy of the offer and all other material sent to holders of shares of Class A Common Stock in respect of the offer, and as soon as reasonably possible after any additional material, including a notice of variation, is sent to the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock in respect of the offer, the Corporation shall send a copy of such additional material to each holder of shares of Class B Common Stock. 

  

  

 (m) Prior to or forthwith after sending any notice referred to in paragraph (g) of this Article Fifth, the Corporation shall cause a press release to be issued to a U.S. and Canadian national newswire service, describing the contents of the notice. 

   

 (n) No stock certificates representing Exchangeable Converted Shares shall be delivered to or to the order of the holders of the shares before such shares are tendered into the Exclusionary Offer; the transfer agent, on behalf of the holders of the Exchangeable Converted Shares, shall tender pursuant to the Exclusionary Offer a certificate or certificates representing the Exchangeable Converted Shares. Upon completion of the Exclusionary Offer, the transfer agent shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders entitled thereto all consideration paid by the Offeror pursuant to the Exclusionary Offer in respect of the Exchangeable Converted Shares. If the Exchangeable Converted Shares are converted into shares of Class B Common Stock in accordance with the notice of irrevocable election pursuant to Section 16.3 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions (the "Exchangeable Election") delivered to the transfer agent, the transfer agent shall deliver to the holders entitled thereto a stock certificate or certificates representing the shares of Class B Common Stock resulting from the conversion. The Corporation shall make all arrangements with the transfer agent necessary or desirable to give effect to this paragraph (j). The Corporation shall be entitled to rely on the Exchangeable Election in converting Exchangeable Converted Shares into shares of Class B Common Stock. If the right of withdrawal from the Exclusionary Offer is not exercised by the holder of Exchangeable Converted Shares, any conversion into shares of Class B Common Stock pursuant to the Exchangeable Election shall become effective: 

  

  

 (1) in respect of an Exclusionary Offer which is completed, immediately following the time by which the Offer is required under applicable securities laws to purchase and pay for all shares to be acquired by the Offeror under the Exclusionary Offer; and 

  

 (2) in respect of an Exclusionary Offer which is abandoned or withdrawn, at the time at which the Exclusionary Offer is abandoned or withdrawn.

In order to effect a Conversion, a holder of shares of Class A Common Stock must deliver to the Secretary of the Corporation (i) a written notice of such holder\'s election to convert (a "Notice of Conversion") shares of Class A Common Stock specifying the number of shares to be converted and (ii) the certificate or certificates representing such shares. Such Notice of Conversion, once delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, shall be irrevocable. As promptly as practicable after receipt by the Secretary of the Corporation of such Notice of Conversion and such certificate or certificates, the Corporation shall issue and shall deliver to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon such Conversion in accordance with the provisions of this Article Sixth. In the event of a Conversion of a certificate or certificates in part, the Corporation shall also issue to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class A Common Stock not being so converted. A Conversion shall be deemed to have been consummated immediately prior to the close of business on the date the Secretary of the Corporation 

        

receives the Notice of Conversion of the holder of Class A Common Shares
electing to make such Conversion (the "Conversion Date"), or if the Conversion
Date is not a business day, then the next business day, and as of such date
such holder shall be deemed to be a holder of record of the number of shares
of Class B Common Stock issuable upon such Conversion in accordance with
this Article Sixth notwithstanding that the share register of the Corporation
may then be closed or that a certificate or certificates representing such
shares of Class B Common Stock shall not then actually be issued or delivered
to such holder.

  

 (b) Upon any Conversion the holder of shares of Class A Common Stock being converted shall receive a number of shares of Class B Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock being converted. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the delivery of any shares of Class B Common Stock that the Corporation is obligated to deliver pursuant to any Conversion, the Corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations which require action to be taken by the Corporation in connection with such Conversion. 

  

 (d) The Corporation shall pay any and all documentary stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Class B Common Stock upon any Conversion, other than any tax payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of Class B Common Stock in a name other than that of the holder of the shares of Class A Common Stock converted pursuant to such Conversion immediately prior to such Conversion. The Corporation shall have the right not to issue or deliver any shares of Class B Common Stock in a name other than that of the holder of the shares of Class A Common Stock converted pursuant to a Conversion immediately prior to such Conversion unless and until the person requesting such issuance or delivery has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid. 

  

 SEVENTH. The Board of Directors is authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation (the "Bylaws"); _provided_ , that the power of the Board of Directors to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws may be limited by an amendment to the Bylaws adopted by the holders of Class A Common Stock that provides that a particular Bylaw or Bylaws may only be adopted, amended or repealed by the holders of Class A Common Stock.

 1.2.2 Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to (a) the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of such meeting and (b) any proposal of business made by stockholders of record of the Corporation who hold at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting power entitled to vote for a majority of directors. 

  

  

    
 Section 1.3. _ Notice of Meetings. _ Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the meeting stating the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given to all stockholders of the Corporation, whether or not entitled to vote at such meeting. Unless otherwise provided by law, the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to notice of, or to vote at, the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall 

        

be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder\'s address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation.

  

    
 Section 1.4. _ Adjournments. _ Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time, to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, place thereof, if any, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to notice of, or to vote at, the adjourned meeting. 

  

    
 Section 1.5. _ Quorum. _ At each meeting of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of the total votes of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote on a matter at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum with respect to such matter. Shares entitled to vote as a separate class or series may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares is present. For purposes of the foregoing, where a separate vote by class or classes or a series or multiple series is required for any matter, the holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of the total votes of the outstanding shares of such class or classes or a series or multiple series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. In the absence of a quorum of the holders of any class or series of stock entitled to vote on a matter, the holders of such class or series so present or represented may, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power present or by action of the Chairman, adjourn the meeting of such class or series with respect to that matter from time to time in the manner provided by Section 1.4 of these Bylaws until a quorum of such class or series shall be so present or represented. Shares of its own capital stock belonging on the record date for the meeting to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity. 

  

    
 Section 1.6. _ Organization. _ 

  

  

 1.6.1 The chairman of the annual or any special meeting of the stockholders shall be the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in the absence of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, any director designated by the Board of Directors. The Secretary, or in the absence of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, shall act as the secretary of the meeting, but in the absence of the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. 

  

 1.6.2 The order of business at each such meeting shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the adjournment of any meeting in the chairman\'s discretion, the establishment of procedures for the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation, restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the commencement thereof and the opening and closing of the voting polls. The chairman of the meeting shall have absolute authority over matters of procedure and there shall be no appeal from the ruling of the chairman. 

  

      

  
  

 1.6.3 The chairman may ask or require that anyone who is not a bona fide stockholder or proxyholder leave the meeting. 

  

  

    
 Section 1.7. _ Inspectors. _ Prior to any meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors may, and shall if required by law, appoint one or more inspectors to act at such meeting and make a written report thereof and may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at the meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting may, and shall if required by law, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. The inspectors need not be stockholders of the Corporation. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, count all votes and ballots, determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors and certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons to assist them in the performance of their duties. The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxy or vote, nor any revocation thereof or change thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. 

  

    
 Section 1.8. _ Voting; Proxies. _ Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder that has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting shall so determine. Except where applicable law or regulation (including the regulations of stock exchanges or similar bodies), the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws require a different vote, if a quorum exists, action on a matter other than the election of directors is approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action. In an election of directors, a plurality of the votes of the shares of the class or series of stock present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting and entitled to vote for the relevant directors is required in order to elect such director. 

   

    
 Section 1.9. _ Nominations and Stockholder Proposals. _ 

  

  

 1.9.1 Nominations by the Board of Directors.

Such stockholder\'s notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director to be elected by the holders of the class of stock held by such stockholder, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, including such person\'s written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation\'s books, and of any such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or this Section 1.9, as applicable, and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with the Certificate of Incorporation or this Section 1.9, as applicable, to declare that such defective nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted.

 Section 1.10. _ Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record. _ 

  

  

 1.10.1 In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 

  

 1.10.2 In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record 

  

      

  
  

date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required
by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of
the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.
Delivery made to the Corporation\'s registered office shall be by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has
been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be
at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts
the resolution taking such prior action.

  

 1.10.3 In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 

  

  

    
 Section 1.11. _ List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. _ The officer who has charge of the stock ledger shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting or (ii) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. The list of stockholders must also be open to examination at the meeting as required by applicable law. Except as otherwise provided by law, (a) the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled by this Section 1.11 to examine the list of stockholders required by this Section 1.11 or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and (b) failure to prepare or make available the list of stockholders shall not effect the validity of actions taken at the meeting. 

  

    
 Section 1.12. _ Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting. _ Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the Class A Holders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which minutes of proceedings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation\'s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation in the manner provided by the previous sentence, written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner provided by the previous sentence. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not 

        

consented in writing and who were Class A Holders or Class B Holders of
record as of the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of
holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation.

  

    
 Section 1.13. _ Meeting by Remote Communication. _ If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication: (a) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (i) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder, (ii) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (iii) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.

The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Section 8.4 shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such Covered Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

  

 8.4.4 Other Sources. The Corporation\'s obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit enterprise. 

   

 8.4.5 Amendment or Repeal. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.4 shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any Covered Person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

This Section 8.4 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify persons other than Covered Persons and to advance expenses to such other persons when and as authorized by appropriate corporate action. 

   

 8.4.7 Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person that the Corporation is permitted to indemnify in accordance with these Bylaws against any liability asserted against any such person and incurred by such person whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the DGCL. Any such insurance may be procured from any insurance company designated by the Board of Directors, whether such insurance company is formed under the laws of this state or any other jurisdiction of the United States or elsewhere, including any insurance company in which the Corporation has an equity interest through stock ownership or otherwise.

Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee
in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes
of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested
directors be less than a quorum; or (ii) the material facts as to the
director\'s or officer\'s relationship or interest and as to the contract or
transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote
thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good
faith by vote of the stockholders; or (iii) the contract or transaction is
fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or
ratified, by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the stockholders.
Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of
a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee which
authorizes the contract or transaction.

  

    
 Section 8.6. _ Prohibited Transactions. _ For so long as the Corporation is a publicly-traded company or subject to applicable federal or state securities laws or exchange or other market listing requirements, no extensions of credit in the form of personal loans or other prohibited forms of assistance under Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may be made to a director or executive officer of the Corporation. 

  

    
 Section 8.7. _ Form of Records. _ Any records maintained by the Corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account and minute books, may be kept on, or by means of, or be in the form of, any information storage device or method, provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable time. 

   

    
 Section 8.8. _ Record of Stockholders. _ The Secretary shall maintain, or shall cause to be maintained, a record of the names and addresses of the Corporation\'s stockholders, in a form that permits preparation of a list of stockholders that is arranged by class of stock entitled to vote and, within each such class, by series of shares, that is alphabetical within each class or series, and that shows the address of, and the number of shares of each class or series held by, each stockholder. 

   

    
 Section 8.9. _ Addresses of Stockholders. _ Each stockholder shall furnish to the Secretary of the Corporation or the Corporation\'s transfer agent an address to which notices from the Corporation, including notices of meetings, may be directed and if any stockholder shall fail so to designate such an address, it shall be sufficient for any such notice to be directed to such stockholder at such stockholder\'s address last known to the Secretary or transfer agent. 

   

    
 Section 8.10. _ Amendment of Bylaws. _ 

  

  

 8.10.1 Subject to Section 2.7 of these Bylaws, the Board of Directors is authorized to adopt, amend or repeal these Bylaws at any regular meeting of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that Section 2.7 and Section 4.6 of these Bylaws and this Section 8.10 may only be amended or repealed by the vote of the Class A Holders in accordance with Subsection 8.10.2 of these Bylaws. 

  

 8.10.2 The Class A Holders may, by the affirmative vote of holders representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all Class A Holders, adopt additional Bylaws and may amend or repeal any Bylaw, whether or not adopted by them. The power of the Board of Directors to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws may be limited by an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or an amendment to these Bylaws by the Class A Holders that provides that a particular Bylaw or Bylaws may only be adopted, amended or repealed by the Class A Holders. 

  

  

    
 Section 8.11. _ Gender. _ The masculine gender if and when used in these Bylaws is used as a matter of convenience only and shall be interpreted to include the feminine gender as the circumstances indicate.

Exhibit L 
Terms of Registration Rights 

   

 The Registration Rights Agreement shall contain terms and conditions customary for a registration rights agreement in transactions of this nature, including the following: 

     Issuer: | Molson Coors Brewing Company.  
---|--- 
   
 Eligible Stockholders: | 
 "Beneficiaries" party to the Class A Coors Voting Trust Agreement or the
Class A Exchangeable Voting Trust Agreement from time to time.  
   
 Eligible Securities: | 
 Shares of Coors Class B Common Stock (i) held by Eligible Stockholders; and
(ii) issued or issuable upon conversion of shares of Coors Class A Common
Stock or Class B Exchangeable Shares held by Eligible Stockholders.  
   
 Registration Rights: | 
 On the terms described in this term sheet, each Eligible Stockholder will
have the right to participate in any Demand Registration or Incidental
Registration effected by the Issuer, regardless of who requested such
registration.  
   
 Demand Registration: | 
 Each of the Coors Beneficiary Representative and the Molson Beneficiary
Representative (as such terms as defined in the Class A Coors Voting Trust
Agreement) shall have the right to request that the Issuer file a registration
statement (including, at the option of the Issuer, a shelf registration),
covering all or a part of the Eligible Securities. Upon any such request, the
Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to effect such registration as
soon as reasonably practicable, subject to the following:  
   
   | 
  | 
 The Issuer shall not be obligated to effect more than one registration
during any 180-day period.  
   
   | 
  | 
 Each Beneficiary Representative shall have the right to request no more than
five registrations.  
   
   | 
  | 
 If a registration involves an underwritten offering and the underwriters
advise the Issuer that the number of shares requested to be included in the
registration exceeds the number which can reasonably be sold (so as to have an
adverse effect on a successful marketing, including the price at which shares
can be sold or traded), then the Issuer may reduce the number of Eligible
Securities proposed to be registered in view of market conditions (in which
case, the Issuer will include in such registration a number of shares that,
in the opinion of the underwriters, can be sold in view of market conditions,
allocated pro rata among all requesting Eligible Stockholders on the basis of
the relative number of Eligible Securities then held by each such requesting
holder).  
   
 Incidental Registration: | 
 Each Eligible Stockholder will be entitled to incidental (or "piggyback")
registration rights on registrations of the Issuer (including demand
registrations requested by a Beneficiary Representative or, subject to any
other rights granted to third parties, any third parties), subject to the
following:  
   
   | 
  | 
 The Issuer may elect to cancel or postpone a registration at any time,
provided that such registration is not a demand registration requested by a
Beneficiary Representative.  
    |  |   
    
          
   | 
  | 
 If a registration involves an underwritten offering and the underwriters
advise the Issuer that the number of shares requested to be included in the
registration and the number of shares the Issuer intends to include exceed the
number which can reasonably be sold (so as to have an adverse effect on a
successful marketing, including the price at which shares can be sold or
traded), then the Issuer may reduce the number of Eligible Securities proposed
to be registered in view of market conditions (in which case, the Issuer will
include in such registration a number of shares that, in the opinion of the
underwriters, can be sold in view of market conditions, in the following
priorities (a) first, 100% of the securities the Issuer proposes to sell and
(b) second, to the extent of the number of registrable securities that, in the
opinion of the underwriters, can be sold in view of market conditions,
allocated pro rata among all requesting Eligible Stockholders (without
regard to whether such holders requested demand or incidental registrations)
and, subject to any other rights granted to third parties, any third parties
requesting registration on the basis of the relative number of shares of Coors
Class B Common Stock then held by each such requesting Eligible Holder and
third party).  
---|---|--- 
   
 Expenses: | 
 The Issuer will pay reasonable customary registration expenses in connection
with a registration.  
   
 Other Provisions: | 
 The registration rights shall be subject to customary limitations,
conditions and provisions, including those concerning blackout periods;
indemnification; provision of information regarding requesting holders;
selection of underwriters and counsel; and the execution and delivery of
customary agreements.
