<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This COMBINATION AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of July&nbsp;21, 2004, between ADOLPH COORS COMPANY, a Delaware corporation
("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Coors</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), COORS CANADA&nbsp;INC., a Canadian corporation and an indirect Subsidiary of Coors

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
board of directors of Molson, based upon the recommendation of an independent committee of Molson's board of directors (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Independent

things, each of those stockholders of Coors has agreed, subject to the terms thereof, to vote all shares of Coors Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and Coors Class&nbsp;B Common Stock owned by each of
them in accordance with the terms of the Coors Voting Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
parties hereto intend that the Arrangement will provide shareholders of Molson who are residents of Canada for purposes of the ITA with the opportunity to exchange

any withholding taxes other than Canadian Federal or Provincial taxes withheld at source ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>non-Canadian withholding taxes</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") are imposed,
directly or indirectly, in respect of such dividends. Such additional amounts shall be determined such that, on an after-tax basis, the Canadian resident holder has received the same

the jurisdiction imposing such non-Canadian withholding taxes, (y)&nbsp;non-Canadian withholding tax and (z)&nbsp;Canadian income tax, in each case, in respect of such
additional amounts after any reductions of income, credits or deductions available to such holder arising as a result of such non-Canadian withholding taxes or any payments made under this
Section&nbsp;6.1(h) (and only to the extent a net increase in tax is reasonably demonstrated by such holder). If gross income tax in the jurisdiction imposing such non-Canadian
withholding taxes is paid directly by a Canadian resident holder of Exchangeable Shares with respect to dividends on such Exchangeable Shares or any payments made under this Section&nbsp;6.1(h),
Exchangeco shall make a tax reimbursement payment to the Canadian resident holder of the Exchangeable Shares for any such taxes (whether such taxes are actually withheld, paid by reason of notice
received from a taxing authority or otherwise) not covered by additional amounts described above (and computed by treating the tax reimbursement payment for purposes of this section as an additional
amount to which this section applies). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such additional amounts and tax reimbursement payments will not apply to the extent non-Canadian withholding taxes are
imposed at a rate in excess of the withholding tax rate applicable to payments of dividends to individuals under the income tax treaty between the United States and Canada, or any successor treaty.
Without limiting a Canadian resident holder's obligation to reasonably demonstrate a net increase in taxes imposed as described above, nothing contained herein shall require any Canadian resident
holder of the Exchangeable Shares to disclose any confidential or propriety information (including, without limitation, its tax return). In no event shall anything in this Section&nbsp;6.1(h)

to and in compliance with the provisions of this Article&nbsp;18, each holder of shares of Class&nbsp;A Exchangeable Shares may, at any time and from time to time, at
such holder's election, convert any or all outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;A Exchangeable Shares held by such holder into shares of Class&nbsp;B Exchangeable Shares (any such conversion, a
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Conversion</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") pursuant to the provisions of this section&nbsp;18.1. In order to effect a Conversion, a holder of shares of Class&nbsp;A Exchangeable
Shares must deliver at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of the Class&nbsp;A Exchangeable Shares (i)&nbsp;a written notice of such
holder's election to convert (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Notice of Conversion</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") shares of Class&nbsp;A Exchangeable Shares specifying the number of shares to be converted and
(ii)&nbsp;the certificate or certificates representing such shares. Such Notice of Conversion, once delivered to the Transfer Agent, shall be irrevocable. As promptly as practicable after receipt by
the Transfer Agent of such Notice of Conversion and such certificate or certificates, the Transfer Agent shall on behalf of the Corporation issue and shall deliver to such holder a certificate or
certificates for the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Exchangeable Shares issuable upon such Conversion in accordance with the provisions of this Article&nbsp;18. In the event of a Conversion of a
certificate or certificates in part, the Transfer Agent shall also issue on behalf of the Corporation to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class&nbsp;A
Exchangeable Shares not being so converted. A Conversion shall be deemed to have been consummated immediately prior to the close of business on the date the Transfer Agent receives the Notice of
Conversion of the holder of Class&nbsp;A Common Shares electing to make such Conversion (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Conversion Date</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), or if the Conversion Date is not a
business day, then the next business day, and as of such date such holder shall be deemed to be a holder of record of the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Exchangeable Shares issuable upon such
Conversion in accordance with this Article&nbsp;18 notwithstanding that the share register of the Corporation may then be closed or that a certificate or certificates representing such shares of
Class&nbsp;B Exchangeable Shares shall not then actually be issued or delivered to such holder.

any Conversion the holder of shares of Class&nbsp;A Exchangeable Shares being converted shall receive a number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Exchangeable Shares equal to the

be equitably adjusted in the event of any recapitalization of the Corporation by means of a stock dividend on, or a stock split or combination of, outstanding Class&nbsp;A Exchangeable Shares or
Class&nbsp;B Exchangeable Shares, or in the event of any merger, consolidation or other reorganization of the Corporation with another corporation.

Such notice shall specify whether the Claim arises as a result of a claim by a person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim") or whether the Claim does not so arise (a "Direct Claim"),
and shall also specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent that the information is available) the factual basis for the Claim and the amount of the Claim, if known. If, through the gross

respect to any Direct Claim, following receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have 30&nbsp;days to make such investigation of the
Claim as is considered necessary or desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by the
Indemnified Party to substantiate the Claim, together with all such other information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. If both parties agree at or prior to the expiration of such
30-day period (or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay to the Indemnified Party the full
agreed upon amount of the Claim. </FONT></P>

without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall remain liable for the
settlement amount even if any such consent is not obtained for any reason. If the Indemnified Party elects to assume such control, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to
participate in the negotiation, settlement or defence of such Third Party Claim. If any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that the Indemnified Party is required by applicable law to make a payment
to any person (a "Third Party") with respect to the Third Party Claim before the completion of settlement negotiations or related legal proceedings, the Indemnified Party may make such payment and the
Indemnifying Party shall, forthwith after demand by the Indemnified Party, reimburse the Indemnified Party for such payment. If the amount of any liability of the indemnified Party under the Third
Party Claim in respect of which such payment was made, as finally determined, is less than the amount that was paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall,
forthwith after receipt of the difference from the Third Party, pay the amount of such difference to the Indemnifying Party. </FONT></P>

the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall co-operate fully with each other with respect to Third Party Claims, and shall keep each other fully advised
with respect thereto (including supplying copies of all relevant documentation promptly as it becomes available). </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing Guarantee:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guarantee shall be a continuing guarantee and shall be binding as a continuing
obligation of the Guarantor. For all purposes of the liability of the Guarantor hereunder including without limitation the calculation of the amount of the Liabilities at any time, every sum of money
which is now or which may hereafter from time to time be due or owing to any Creditor by any Debtor (or would have become so due or owing were it not for the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or
winding-up of such Debtor) shall be deemed to be and to continue due and owing to such Creditor until the same shall be actually paid in cash to such Creditor, notwithstanding the
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or winding-up of such Debtor or any other event whatsoever. The Guarantor agrees that, if at any time all or any part of any payment previously
applied by any Creditor to any of the Liabilities is or must be rescinded or returned by such Creditor for any reason whatsoever (including without limitation the insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or winding-up of a Debtor), such Liability shall, for the purpose of this guarantee, to the extent that such payment is or must be rescinded or returned, be deemed to have
continued in existence, notwithstanding such application by such Creditor, and this guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such Liability, all as though
such application had not been made. No assurance, security or payment which may be rescinded or avoided under any law relating to insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or winding-up and
no release, settlement, discharge or arrangement which may have been given or made on the faith of any such assurance, security or payment shall prejudice or affect the right of the Creditors to
recover from the Guarantor to the full extent of this guarantee as if such assurance, security, payment, release, settlement, discharge or arrangement had never been granted, given or made. Any such
release, settlement, discharge or arrangement shall as between the Creditors and the Guarantor, be deemed to have been given or made upon the express condition that it shall become and be wholly void
and of no effect if the assurance, security or payment on the faith of which it was made or given shall at any time thereafter be rescinded or avoided as aforesaid, to the intent so that the Creditors
shall become and be entitled at any time after any such recission or avoidance to exercise all or any of the rights conferred upon the Creditors hereunder and of all other rights which by virtue and
as a consequence of this guarantee the Creditors would have been entitled to exercise but for such release, settlement, discharge or arrangement. </FONT></P>

Without limiting the foregoing, no Creditor shall be obliged to take any action or to exhaust any recourse against any Debtor, any other person, or any security held at any time by any Creditor, nor
to value any security held by any Creditor, before requiring, or being entitled to, payment from, and to enforce its rights and remedies against, the Guarantor under this guarantee. No Creditor shall
be obliged to marshall any assets in favour of the Guarantor. Any third party dealing with any Creditor shall not be concerned to see or inquire as to the validity of any demand under this guarantee. </FONT></P>

enforceability of any agreement between any Creditor and any Debtor or any document provided by any Debtor to any Creditor; (b)&nbsp;any failure on the part of any Debtor to carry out any rights or
obligations under any agreement or document; (c)&nbsp;any change in the name, objects, powers, organization, share capital, constating documents, business, shareholders, directors or management of

(1)&nbsp;vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder that has voting power upon the matter in question. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent
or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three
(3)&nbsp;years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled
with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation
generally. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed
proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all
classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting shall so determine. Except where applicable law or regulation (including the regulations of stock
exchanges or similar bodies), the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws require a different vote, if a quorum exists, action on a matter other than the election of directors is approved if the
votes cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action. In an election of directors, a plurality of the votes of the shares of the class or series of stock present in person or
represented by proxy at a meeting and entitled to vote for the relevant directors is required in order to elect such director. </FONT></P>

If a registration involves an underwritten offering and the underwriters advise the Issuer that the number of shares requested to be included in the registration and the number of shares the Issuer intends to include exceed the number which can
reasonably be sold (so as to have an adverse effect on a successful marketing, including the price at which shares can be sold or traded), then the Issuer may reduce the number of Eligible Securities proposed to be registered in view of market
conditions (in which case, the Issuer will include in such registration a number of shares that, in the opinion of the underwriters, can be sold in view of market conditions, in the following priorities (a) first, 100% of the securities the Issuer
proposes to sell and (b) second, to the extent of the number of registrable securities that, in the opinion of the underwriters, can be sold in view of market conditions, allocated pro rata among all requesting Eligible Stockholders (without regard
to whether such holders requested demand or incidental registrations) and, subject to any other rights granted to third parties, any third parties requesting registration on the basis of the relative number of shares of Coors Class B Common Stock
then held by each such requesting Eligible Holder and third party).</FONT></TD>
