Adjustment Statement_ '') relating to (1) the Certified Closing Date Cash

Preliminary Working Capital Statement shall be prepared by the Purchaser
in accordance with _Schedule I_. The Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall
provide reasonable detail (including supporting schedules) supporting the
Purchaser\'s calculation of Closing Date Working Capital and any Objection
Item. Following the Closing, each of the Purchaser and the Sellers shall give
the other Person and any independent accountants of such other Person
reasonable access to the properties, books, records and personnel of the
Companies relating to periods prior to the Closing for purposes of preparing
and reviewing the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. The Sellers shall have 60
days following delivery to the Sellers of the Preliminary

such dispute (including the Sellers\' proposal with respect to the Closing
Date Working Capital, the amount of the Companies\' cash and cash equivalents
(including interest earned on cash deposits) as at Closing and/or the amount
of Sellers Third Party Indebtedness as at Closing (together with any accrued

Sellers fail to notify the Purchaser in writing of any dispute within such
60-day period, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be deemed to be
the '' _Final Adjustment Statement_.'' In the event that the Sellers
shall so notify the Purchaser of any dispute on or prior to such 60th
day, any amounts contained in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement that
are not disputed by the Sellers in the Dispute Notice shall be deemed
to have been finally determined for purposes of calculating the
Actual Closing Date Working Capital, the Actual Closing Date Cash and/or
the Actual Sellers Third Party Indebtedness (as the case may be). For
a period of 15 days following the delivery of the Dispute

 
   

 Notice to the Purchaser, the Chief Financial Officer (or the natural
Person(s) performing similar functions) of each of the Purchaser and the
Sellers shall attempt to resolve in good faith the amounts disputed in the
Dispute Notice. During such 15-day period, the Purchaser shall be permitted
to review the working papers of the Sellers and the Sellers\' auditors
(subject to the execution of customary access letters) relating to the
Estimated Working Capital Statement and the Dispute Notice, and the Sellers
shall be permitted to review the working papers of the Purchaser and the
Purchaser\'s auditors (subject to the execution of customary access
letters) relating to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and/or the
Objection Statement (if any). Amounts resolved by such attempts within
such 15-day period shall be deemed to have been finally determined
for purposes of calculating the Actual Closing Date Working Capital,
the Actual Closing Date Cash and/or the Actual Sellers Third
Party Indebtedness (as the case may be).

 

(b) If the Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to resolve any such
dispute(s) set forth in the Dispute Notice prior to the end of such 15-day
resolution period, Grant Thornton, in the first instance, Mahoney Cohen, in
the alternative, or, in the event that neither Grant Thornton or
Mahoney Cohen is able to serve, an accounting firm mutually acceptable to
both the Purchaser and the Sellers (the '' _Designated Accounting Firm_ '')
shall be appointed by the Purchaser and the Sellers to resolve such dispute,
and such Accounting Firm\'s (as hereinafter defined) determination shall be
final and binding on the parties to this Agreement. If the Purchaser and
the Sellers cannot mutually agree on the selection of the
Designated Accounting Firm (assuming that Grant Thornton and Mahoney Cohen
cannot serve), the Purchaser and the Sellers shall submit to such
other Person\'s independent accountants the name of a reputable and widely
recognized accounting firm which does not as of Closing, and has not in the
two years prior to Closing, provided audit or other services to any of the
Sellers, the Companies or the Purchaser, and the accounting firm shall be
selected by lot from these two firms by the independent accountants of the
Purchaser and the Sellers (such selected accounting firm, the '' _Other
Accounting Firm_ ''). Grant Thornton, Mahoney Cohen, the Designated
Accounting Firm or the Other Accounting Firm finally determined in accordance
with this _Section 2.1(b)_ shall hereinafter be referred to as the ''
_Accounting Firm_ ''; _provided_ , that, in no event, may the Accounting
Firm be KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst and Young Global Limited, Deloitte
and Touche LLP or BDO Seidman, LLP. The Accounting Firm may not make any
determination with respect to any matter not set forth in the Dispute Notice
or otherwise previously resolved, and the Accounting Firm\'s determination of
(i) the Actual Closing Date Working Capital shall not be more than the
Closing Date Working Capital set forth in the Dispute Notice or less than
the amount of the Closing Date Working Capital set forth in the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement, (ii) the Companies\' cash and
cash equivalents (including interest earned on cash deposits) as at
Closing shall not be more than the Certified Closing Date Cash or less than
the amount of the Companies\' cash and cash equivalents (including interest
earned on cash deposits) as at Closing set forth in the Objection Notice (if
any) or (iii) the amount of Sellers Third Party Indebtedness (together with
any accrued interest thereon and the amount of any applicable prepayment
penalties or similar costs or fees set forth in the applicable payoff letter
agreed upon by the Sellers) as at Closing shall not be more than the amount
of Sellers Third Party Indebtedness (together with any accrued interest
thereon and the amount of any applicable prepayment penalties or similar
costs or fees set forth in the applicable payoff letter agreed upon by the
Sellers) as at Closing set forth in the Objection Notice (if any) or less
than the Certified Sellers Third Party Indebtedness Amount. Each of
the Purchaser and the Sellers and their respective independent
accountants shall give the Accounting Firm access at all reasonable times to
the properties, books, records and personnel of the Companies relating
to periods prior to the Closing for purposes of reviewing the
Estimated Working Capital Statement, the Dispute Notice and the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement and calculating the Actual Closing Date
Working Capital, the Actual Closing Date Cash and/or the Actual Sellers
Third Party Indebtedness (as the case may be). The Accounting Firm shall
be instructed to use every reasonable effort to perform its services within
60 days of submission of the Estimated Working Capital Statement, the Dispute
Notice and the Preliminary Adjustment Statement to it and, in any case, as
promptly as practicable after such submission. The Preliminary Adjustment
Statement, as modified by resolution of any disputes by the Purchaser and the
Sellers or by the Accounting Firm, shall be deemed to be the ''
_Final Adjustment Statement_.'' The Actual Net Indebtedness Amount shall be
computed by the Purchaser using the 

 
   

 Actual Sellers Third Party Indebtedness and the Actual Closing Date Cash.
The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall
bear equally the fees and expenses relating to the engagement of the
Accounting Firm.

_Section 9.4(c)_ , if notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of any Third
Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not, within 35 days after the
Indemnified Party\'s notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of
its election to assume the defense of such Action, the Indemnifying Party
will be bound by any determination made in such Action or any compromise or
settlement effected by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will
be responsible for any Losses incurred in connection with the defense,
compromise, settlement or final determination of such Action.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that an Action may adversely
affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for
which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, except
where nonmonetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or
claims for monetary damages, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to
the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise
or settle such Action ( _provided_ , that any costs or fees incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with such defense, compromise or settlement
shall be borne exclusively by such Indemnified Party), but the Indemnifying
Party will not be bound by any determination of an Action so defended or any
compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be
unreasonably withheld); _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to participate in such defense and to employ counsel at its own
expense.

 
   

(d) The parties shall cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and
shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the provisions of this _Article IX_.

 

Section 9.5 _Indemnification Procedure for Other Claims_.

 

(a) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this  _Article IX_ that does not involve a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of a
claim promptly following the Indemnified Party becoming aware of the
same; such notice shall be delivered in accordance with _Section 11.1_. The
failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any Liability that it may have to
such Indemnified Party under this  _Article IX_ , except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced by such failure.

 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
35 Business Days following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying
Party disputes such claim, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in
such notice shall be conclusively deemed a Liability of the Indemnifying
Party under this _Article IX_ , and (i) where, on or prior to the applicable
Release Date, the Indemnifying Party is a Seller, the Purchaser shall execute
on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnified Party, and deliver to the Escrow
Agent, a Joint Notice to pay the amount of such Liability to such Indemnified
Party on demand or due, or in the case of any notice in which the amount of
the claim is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim
is finally determined and (ii) where (x) the Indemnifying Party is the
Purchaser or (y) following the applicable Release Date, the Indemnifying
Party is the Seller, in each case, the Indemnifying Party shall pay (in cash
by wire transfer of immediately available funds) the amount of such Liability
to the Indemnified Party on demand or due, or, in the case of any notice in
which the amount of the claim is estimated, on such later date when the
amount of such claim is finally determined.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party disputes its Liability with respect to such
claim in a timely manner, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if
not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by
litigation in accordance with _Section 11.6_ (in any event, such
resolved amount, the '' _Resolved Amount_ ''). Where on or prior to the
applicable Release Date, the Indemnifying Party is a Seller, within two
Business Days of the resolution of such dispute, the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall execute on behalf of the Purchaser Indemnified Party, and
deliver to the Escrow Agent, a Joint Notice, instructing such Escrow Agent
to pay the Resolved Amount to the Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement. Any payments made to the Purchaser shall not
be subject to withholding Taxes. Where (x) the Indemnifying Party is
the Purchaser or (y) following the applicable Release Date, the Indemnifying
Party is a Seller, in each case, within two Business Days of the resolution
of such dispute, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the Resolved Amount (in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds) to the Indemnified
Party.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, promptly following (i)
March 13, 2007 (the '' _Initial Release Date_ ''), the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Notice to
affect the delivery by the Escrow Agent to the Sellers of all property then
held by the Escrow Agent (subject to retention of amounts sufficient
to satisfy any pending claims for Losses), less €6,715,917 or such lesser
amount then held by the Escrow Agent (including amounts retained on account
of pending claims for Losses) (the '' _Designated Escrow Amount_ ''), which
Designated Escrow Amount the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold under, and
pursuant to, the Escrow Agreement and (ii) March 12, 2008 (the ''
_Final Release Date_ '' and, together with the Initial Release Date, the ''
_Release Dates_ ''), the Sellers and the Purchaser shall execute and deliver
to the Escrow Agent a Joint Notice to affect the delivery by such Escrow
Agent to the Sellers of all property then held by the Escrow Agent (subject
to retention of amounts sufficient to satisfy any pending claims for Losses).

 

Section 9.6  _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Indemnification of the Purchaser_. Subject to _Section 9.7(b)_ , the
Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Losses

 
   

 which arise out of, or result from, the following Tax matters
(collectively, the '' _Tax Matters_ ''): (i) any Tax in excess of
amounts accrued in respect of such Tax on any Company\'s financial books and
records (which accruals shall be made in accordance with Applicable GAAP and
shall not reflect any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
payable by or on behalf of the Sellers or any Sellers\' Affiliates, or any
Company, for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (or
for the portion ending on the Closing Date of any taxable period that
includes but does not begin or end on the Closing Date), (ii) any
deficiencies in any Tax payable by, or on behalf of, the Sellers or any
Sellers\' Affiliates, or any Company arising from any audit by any taxing
agency or authority with respect to any period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (or for the portion ending on the Closing Date of any taxable
period that includes but does not begin or end on the Closing Date), (iii)
any claim or demand for reimbursement or indemnification resulting from any
transfer by the Sellers prior to the Closing of any Tax benefits or credits
to any other Person, (iv) one-half of any Transfer Taxes arising from
the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) any Liability for Taxes
as a result of the Euro Cormar Separation and (vi) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by any Seller in _Sections 4.18_ and _5.17_ (
_provided_ , that, to the extent that any such representation or warranty is
qualified by immateriality, materiality, material adverse effect or any
derivation of any of the foregoing, such qualifications shall be ignored for
purposes of indemnification under this _Section 9.6_ ); _provided_ , that
the Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover more than the amount of any
Loss due as a result of bringing a claim for indemnification under more than
one clause of this _Section 9.6(a)_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that
a ''Loss'' for purposes of this _Section 9.6(a)_ only shall not include any
amount of Tax to the extent attributable to a change by a Company after the
Closing Date in a legally permissible method of tax accounting that was used
by such Company consistently through the Closing Date (but a change after
the Closing Date by any Company relating to the transfer pricing used
in respect of any payment between any of the Companies shall not be
viewed as a change in a legally permissible method of tax accounting
for purposes of the preceding proviso).

 

(b) _Audit Matters_. If any claim for Losses in respect of Taxes relating
to any Company involving taxable periods for which the Sellers have
an obligation to indemnify the Purchaser under _Section 9.6(a)_  hereof is
asserted by any taxing authority against the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Sellers in writing of such fact;  _provided_ , _however_
, that the failure to notify the Sellers will not relieve the Sellers of any
liability that it may have to the Purchaser, except to the extent that the
Sellers demonstrate that the Sellers were actually prejudiced by the
Sellers\' failure to receive such notice. The Sellers shall have the right,
at the Sellers\' expense, directly or through the Sellers\' designated
Representatives, subject to the execution of a confidentiality agreement by
the Sellers and each of Sellers\' designated Representatives, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser, for the purpose of
protecting the confidentiality and use of information of the Purchaser or
its Affiliates, including any Company to control any audit, examination,
or proceedings relating to Taxes (a '' _Tax Contest_ ''), in respect of any
Tax Return for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date if such Tax
Contest could give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall have the right to
participate in any such Tax Contest and to review in advance and comment upon
all submissions made in the course of any Tax Contest to any Governmental
Entity. In case the Sellers exercise any of the rights under this _Section
9.6(b)_ , the Sellers shall provide to the Purchaser the funds necessary to
make any payment due in connection with any settlement (i) of a Tax Contest
and (ii) of a Tax Contest ("concordato''/"condono fiscale'') within five
Business Days of payment by the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall have the right
to control any audit, examination or proceedings related to Taxes in respect
of any Tax Return for periods (x) beginning before, but ending after,
the Closing Date and (y) beginning on or following the Closing Date; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers shall have the right to participate
in any such Tax Contest and to review in advance and comment upon all
submissions made in the course of any Tax Contest to any Governmental Entity.

 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. After the Closing Date, the Sellers, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser and the Companies, on the other hand, shall (i)
provide, or cause to be provided, to each other\'s
respective Representatives, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants,
such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Returns,

 
   

 or any audit of any Company in respect of which the Sellers, on the one
hand, or the Purchaser or any Company, on the other hand, as the case may be,
are responsible, and (ii) retain, or cause to be retained, for so long as any
such taxable years or audits shall remain open for adjustments, any records
or information which may be relevant to any such Tax Returns or audits. The
assistance provided for in this _Section 9.6(c)_ shall include the
Sellers and the Purchaser (x) making their Representatives, attorneys
and accountants and the Representatives of their respective
Affiliates available to each other on a mutually convenient basis to provide
such assistance as might reasonably be expected to be of use in
connection with any such Tax Returns or audits and (y) providing, or causing
to be provided, such information as might reasonably be expected to be of
use in connection with any such Tax Returns or audits, including
records, returns, Schedules, documents, work papers, opinions, letters
or memoranda, or other relevant materials relating thereto.

 

(d) The Purchaser shall not amend any Tax Return in respect of any taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing without Sellers\' consents.

 

Section 9.7  _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Sellers shall have no Liability to indemnify the Purchaser for
Losses under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ until the total of all such Losses that are
incurred by the Purchaser exceeds $5,000,000, and then only for the amount by
which such Losses exceed $5,000,000. The Sellers\' maximum Liability for such
Losses with respect to all claims for indemnification under this _Article IX_
shall be limited to and shall not exceed (in the aggregate) the sum of
(i) €37,320,000 (which Euro amount shall constitute 77.75% of the Cap)
_plus_ (ii) $12,722,016 (which United States Dollar amount shall constitute
22.25% of the Cap) (the '' _Cap_ ''); _provided_ , that (x) the Fingen
Sellers\' maximum Liability for such claims shall be limited to and shall not
exceed the Fingen Seller\'s Pro Rata Share of the Cap, in the aggregate and
(y) CKI\'s maximum Liability for such Losses with respect to such claims
shall be limited to and shall not exceed CKI\'s Pro Rata Share of the
Cap. Notwithstanding any provision in this _Section 9.7(a)_ to the contrary,
at the Sellers\' option, the Sellers shall have no Liability to indemnify the
Purchaser for Losses under _Section 9.2(a)_ in respect of any individual
claim for which the Loss relating thereto is less than $50,000; _provided_
,  _further_ , that the Sellers\' may exercise such option with respect to
no more than ten individual claims.

 

(b) To the extent that any Losses arise out of, or result from a breach by
both the Fingen Sellers and CKI of one or more representations,
warranties, agreements, covenants or obligations, the Fingen Sellers, on the
one hand, and CKI, on the other hand, shall severally but not
jointly indemnify the Purchaser in an amount equal to the Fingen Sellers
Pro Rata Share and the CKI Pro Rata Share, respectively, of such Losses
(it being understood that any Losses arising out of, or resulting from,
a Designated Representation and Warranty shall be allocated as between the
Fingen Sellers and CKI in an amount equal to the Fingen Sellers Pro Rata
Share and the CKI Pro Rata Share, respectively). To the extent that any
Losses arise out of, or result from, a breach by only (x) one or more Fingen
Sellers or (y) CKI, in each case, of one or more representations, warranties,
agreements, covenants or obligations, the Fingen Sellers or CKI (as the case
may be) shall solely indemnify the Purchaser in an amount equal to such
Losses. The indemnification obligation of any Fingen Seller under this
_Article IX_ shall be on a joint and several basis as among the Fingen
Sellers.

 

(c) The Purchaser shall have no Liability to indemnify the Sellers for Losses
under _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ until the total of all such Losses that are
incurred by the Sellers exceeds $5,000,000, and then only for the amount by
which such Losses exceed $5,000,000. The Purchaser\'s maximum Liability for
such Losses with respect to all claims for indemnification under this
_Article IX_ shall be limited to and shall not exceed $57,177,600.
Notwithstanding any provision in this _Section 9.7(c)_ to the contrary, at
the Purchaser\'s option, the Purchaser shall have no Liability to indemnify
the Sellers for Losses under _Section 9.2(c)_ in respect of any individual
claim for which the Loss relating thereto is less than $50,000; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Purchaser may exercise such option with respect to no
more than ten individual claims.

 

(d) The limitations contained in  _Section 9.7(a)_ or _9.7(c)_ (as the case
may be) shall not apply to Losses which arise out of, or result from: (i) any
breach by any Seller of any representations and warranties contained in
_ Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.3_ , _4.12_ ,  _4.18_ , _5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.3_ ,
and  _5.17_ , (ii) any breach by the

 
   

 Purchaser of any representations and warranties contained in _Sections 6.1_
and _6.2_ , (iii) any breach by any Seller or the Purchaser (as the case may
be) of any of its agreements, covenants or obligations contained in this
Agreement (other than any agreement, covenant or obligation to certify
any representations and warranties herein), (iv) any intentional breach
of this Agreement or fraudulent or knowing misrepresentations by the parties
hereto, (v) the Tax Matters, (vi) any Software Cure Cost, (vii) any Retained
Euro Cormar Liability, (viii) any Retained Customs Liability, (ix) any
Retained Product Liability, (x) any Retained Euro Retail Liability or (xi)
any CKI Transfer Liability and (xii) any Jeanswear Services International
Trading Liability (such exceptions to the limitations contained in _Section
9.7(a)_ which are described in this _Section 9.7(d)_ , collectively, the ''
_Designated Matters_ '');  _provided_ , that the Sellers\' maximum Liability
for Losses pursuant to _Article X_ shall not exceed the Closing
Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers\'
indemnification obligations in respect of any of the Designated Matters
described in clauses (v) through (ix) of the immediately preceding sentence,
shall be limited to Losses which arise out of, or result from, a pre-
Closing act or pre-Closing omission.

 

(e) All Losses payable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Article IX_  shall be paid first from the funds held in the Escrow
Account;  _provided_ , that, following the Initial Release Date,
the Designated Escrow Amount shall not be applied towards Losses other
than Losses relating to the Designated Matters; _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that, the right of any Purchaser Indemnified Party to recover for Losses
shall not be limited to the funds (if any) remaining in the Escrow Account.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this _Article IX_ to the contrary, the
Sellers shall have no Liability to indemnify the Purchasers for Losses
pursuant to  _Article IX_ to the extent that such Losses do not exceed
the amount of any applicable reserves established on the Final
Adjustment Statement.

 

(g) All indemnification payments paid pursuant to this Agreement shall be
made directly to the Purchaser (in the case of indemnification obligations of
the Sellers) and shall be treated as adjustments to the Closing Purchase
Price for all Tax purposes.

 

Section 9.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, to the extent
permitted by Law, the indemnities set forth in this _Article IX_ shall be the
exclusive remedies of any Indemnified Party for any misrepresentation, breach
of warranty or nonfulfillment or failure to be performed of any agreement,
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, and the parties shall not
be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement or to any
further indemnification rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in
respect thereof or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, all of
which the parties hereto hereby waive; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall
not apply to claims of actual fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.9 _Acknowledgment_. The parties acknowledge that (i) the
indemnification obligations of each Seller hereunder are autonomous and
independent obligations, (ii) none of the representations and warranties of
any of the Sellers set forth herein or in any certificate or document
delivered at Closing by, or on behalf of, the Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement shall be construed or otherwise deemed as a representation or
warranty for purposes of or under Articles 1490 or 1497 of the Italian civil
code, which civil code shall not apply to any breach or other violation of
any representation, warranty, agreement, covenant or obligation of any of the
Sellers and (iii) any claim, right or remedy of any Purchaser Indemnified
Party arising hereunder with respect to any such breach or violation
shall not be subject to the statute of limitation (''prescrizione'') periods
and forfeiture (''decadenza'') restrictions set forth in Article 1495 of the
Italian civil code.

other party solely in the event that the Closing shall not have taken place
on or before February 15, 2006 (the '' _Outside Date_ '');  _provided_ ,

Purchaser, on the other hand, as the case may be) seeking such termination;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that, if on the Outside Date the Purchaser has

and unconditionally agree not to commence any litigation relating
hereto except in such courts) and waive any objection or claim that such

this _Section 11.8_ , under the International Arbitration Rules of the _AAA_
in effect at the time any such arbitration is commenced, except as modified
in this _Section 11.8_.

 

(b) The arbitral tribunal shall be comprised of three arbitrators. Within 30
days after the receipt by respondent of the demand for arbitration, the
Purchaser shall nominate one arbitrator and the Sellers shall collectively
nominate one arbitrator. Within 20 days of the appointment of the second
arbitrator, the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator,
who shall chair the arbitral tribunal (the '' _Chair_ ''). If the Chair
is not timely appointed, or if either party fails to nominate an arbitrator
as noted herein, at the request of any party, the Chair or other arbitrator
shall be appointed by the AAA using listing, ranking and striking procedures.
Any arbitrator appointed by the AAA shall be an experienced arbitrator of
disputes arising out of large, complex commercial transactions, with at least
15 years experience as a judge or practicing attorney, and shall be
unaffiliated and without prior or current financial alliances or affiliates
with any party.

 

(c) The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the English language,
and all documents not in English submitted by any party as evidence must be
accompanied by a certified English translation if the arbitrators so request.
The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted and any arbitral award shall
be rendered in New York (Borough of Manhattan), New York.

 

(d) Each party shall have the right to request the other party or parties to
produce certain specified documents or categories of documents relevant to
the issues in dispute, and any disputes regarding the scope of production
shall be submitted to the arbitral tribunal (or the Chair). In making
any determination regarding the scope of production, the Chair or
the arbitral tribunal shall be guided by the International Bar
Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International
Commercial Arbitration.

 

(e) In rendering an award, the arbitral tribunal shall be required to follow
the law of the jurisdiction designated by the parties herein. In addition to
damages, the arbitral tribunal may award temporary or permanent injunctive
relief, including specific performance of any obligation under this
Agreement. The arbitral tribunal shall not be empowered to award
consequential, punitive, multiple or exemplary damages, and the parties
hereby waive any right to such damages. The award shall be final and binding
upon the parties and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between
the parties regarding any claims, counterclaims, issues or
accounting presented to the arbitral tribunal. Judgment upon any award may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction over any of the parties or
any of their assets.

 

(f) By agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive any New
York Court of its jurisdiction to issue a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-
arbitral attachment or other order in aid of arbitration proceedings or to
maintain the status quo or prevent irreparable harm and the enforcement of
any award. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be
available under the jurisdiction of a New York Court, the arbitral tribunal
shall have full authority to grant provisional remedies or to order
the parties to request that a New York court modify or vacate any
temporary or preliminary relief issued by such national court, and to
award damages for the failure of any party to respect the
arbitral tribunal\'s orders to that effect.

 

(g) In order to facilitate the comprehensive resolution of related Disputes,
upon the request of any party to an arbitration proceeding brought under
this Agreement, the arbitral tribunal for such proceeding shall
consolidate any arbitration proceeding constituted under this Agreement with
any other arbitration proceeding constituted under this Agreement, if
the arbitral tribunal determines that (i) there are issues of fact or
law common to the proceedings so that a consolidated proceeding would
be more efficient than separate proceedings, and (ii) no party would
be unduly prejudiced as a result of such consolidation through undue
delay or otherwise. In the event of different rulings on this

 
   

 question by the arbitral tribunal constituted hereunder and another
arbitral tribunal constituted under this Agreement, the ruling of the
arbitral tribunal constituted first in time shall control, and such arbitral
tribunal shall serve as the tribunal for any consolidated arbitration.

 

Section 11.9  _Publicity_. None of the parties hereto or
their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement
or communication with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the consent of the Sellers and the Purchaser,
except to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the requirements
of applicable Law or the regulations or policies of any securities exchange
based on the advice of counsel, in which case the party required to make the
release or statement or communication shall allow the Sellers or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, reasonable time to comment on such release or
statement or communication in advance of such issuance, disclosure or filing.
The parties have agreed to the contents and time of release of the initial
press release announcing the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser and/or its Affiliates may
disclose any information concerning the transactions contemplated hereby
which it deems appropriate in its reasonable judgment, in light of its status
as a United States publicly-owned company, including any such disclosures in
investor conference calls accessible to the general public or in press
interviews.

 

Section 11.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of each of the other parties; _provided_
,  _however_ , that the Purchaser may assign (in whole or in part) its
rights or obligations hereunder, including with respect to the purchase,
acquisition and acceptance of the Purchased Shares and/or the CMI Shares, to
one or more of its wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no such assignment shall relieve the Purchaser of any of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any
attempted assignment in violation of the terms of this _Section 11.10_
 shall be null and void ab initio.
