end of such Earnout Period in accordance with Section 3.4(a), (b) or (c) (as
applicable), and (ii) the actual amount of Escrow Property that the Seller is
actually entitled to receive at the end of such Earnout Period in accordance
therewith. If there is an Escrow Property Unearned Amount at the end of an
Earnout Period, such Escrow Property Unearned Amount will be deemed forfeited
by the Seller with respect to Section 3.4(a), (b) or (c) (as applicable), but
such Escrow Property Unearned Amount will not be deemed forfeited for
purposes of Sections 3.4(d) and (e), and such Escrow Property Unearned
Amount will be retained by the Escrow Agent until the final determination of
the amount of Escrow Property that the Seller is actually entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 3.4. Within five (5) Business Days after a final
determination of all applicable payments due to Seller pursuant to this
Section 3.4, the Purchaser and the Seller shall provide joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to the Purchaser any remaining
Escrow Property that Seller is finally determined to not be entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section 3.4. The Purchaser will cancel any Escrow
Shares distributed to the Purchaser from the Escrow Account promptly after
its receipt of such instructions and will cancel any Accrued Dividends payable
in respect of such Escrow Shares. The Seller acknowledges that its right to
receive any amounts pursuant to Section 3.4 is subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including (in particular) this
Article III and Article X, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Article III, such right is contingent on both the performance of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for periods after the Closing and any Payment
Offset (as applicable). The Seller further acknowledges that if the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including (in particular) this
Article III and Article X, are not satisfied, the Escrow Property Unearned
Amount will consequently not be paid or delivered to the Seller, and the
Seller shall have no right to receive such Escrow Property Unearned Amount.

3.5 _Determination of Earnout Payment_. As soon as practicable (but
in any event within forty-five (45)) days) after the completion of the
audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for each year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, the
Company's chief financial officer (the "CFO") will prepare and deliver to the
Purchaser and Seller a written statement (the "Earnout _Statement_ ") that
sets forth the CFO's determination in accordance with the terms of this
ARTICLE III of the Adjusted EBITDA and Gross Revenue for year ended December
31, 2019 and the Adjusted EBITDA for year ended December 31, 2020 based on
such audited consolidated financial statements for each respective period, and
the amount of any Earnout Payment the Seller is entitled to receive pursuant
to the terms of Section 3.4. Each of the Purchaser and the Seller will have
thirty (30) days after its receipt of an Earnout Statement to review it. To
the extent reasonably requested in connection with their respective reviews
of the Earnout Statement, the Company and its Subsidiaries will provide each
of the Purchaser and the Seller and their respective representatives with
reasonable access to the Books and Records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, their respective finance personnel and any other information
that the Purchaser or the Seller reasonably requests relating to the
determination of the Adjusted EBITDA and Gross Revenue for year ended December
31, 2019 and the Adjusted EBITDA for year ended December 31, 2020 and the
calculation of the amount of the Earnout Payment. Either the Purchaser or the
Seller may deliver written notice to the CFO (by providing notice to the
Company to the attention of the CFO) and the other party on or prior to the
thirtieth (30th) day after receipt of an Earnout Statement specifying in
reasonable detail any items that they wish to dispute and the basis therefor.
If either the Seller or the Purchaser fails to deliver such written notice in
such thirty (30) day period, then such party will have waived its right to
contest the Earnout Statement and the calculations set forth therein of the
Adjusted EBITDA and Gross Revenue for year ended December 31, 2019 and the
Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the amount of each
respective Earnout Payment (if any). If neither Seller nor Purchaser delivers
such a notice, the calculation of the Earnout Payment set forth in the
Earnout Statement shall become final and for all purposes hereunder (other
than for fraud or manifest error) at the end of such thirty (30) day period,
and the Purchaser and Seller shall provide Release Instructions to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 3.3(d). If either the Purchaser or
the Seller provides the CFO and the other party with written notice of any
objections to the Earnout Statement in such thirty (30) day period, then the
Seller and the Purchaser will, for a period of thirty (30) days following the
date of delivery of such notice, attempt to resolve their differences and any
written resolution by them as to any disputed amount will be final and
binding for all purposes under this Agreement and the Purchaser and Seller
shall provide Release Instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with
Section 3.3(d). If at the conclusion of such thirty (30) day period the
Seller and the Purchaser have not reached an agreement on any objections with
respect to the Earnout Statement, then upon request of either party the
parties will resolve the dispute in accordance with the dispute resolution
procedure set forth in Section 3.6. The Company shall maintain a financial
reporting system that enables the parties to calculate the Adjusted EBITDA
and Gross Revenue for year ended December 31, 2019 and the Adjusted EBITDA for
year ended December 31, 2020 for purposes of this ARTICLE III.

3.6 _Dispute Resolution Procedure_. Matters disputed pursuant to
Section 3.5 may be referred by either the Purchaser or the Seller to the
Independent Expert for determination in accordance with this Section 3.6. Each
of the Seller and the Purchaser agrees to execute, if requested by the
Independent Expert, a reasonable engagement letter with respect to the
determination to be made by the Independent Expert. All fees and expenses of
the Independent Expert will be borne in equal proportions by the Purchaser
and the Seller. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs
and expenses incurred by the Seller in connection with resolving any dispute
hereunder before the Independent Expert will be borne by the Seller, and all
other costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser in connection with
resolving any dispute hereunder before the Independent Expert will be borne
by the Purchaser. The Independent Expert will determine only those issues
still in dispute as of the Dispute Resolution Notice Date and the Independent
Expert's determination will be based solely upon and consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The determination by the
Independent Expert will be based solely on presentations with respect to such
disputed items by the Purchaser and the Seller to the Independent Expert and
not on the Independent Expert's independent review; provided, that such
presentations will be deemed to include any work papers, records, accounts or
similar materials delivered to the Independent Expert by the Purchaser or the
Seller in connection with such presentations and any materials delivered to
the Independent Expert in response to requests by the Independent Expert.
Each of the Seller and the Purchaser will use their reasonable efforts to
make their respective presentations as promptly as practicable following
submission to the Independent Expert of the disputed items, and each such
party will be entitled, as part of its presentation, to respond to the
presentation of the other party and any questions and requests of
the Independent Expert. In deciding any matter, the Independent Expert will
be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, including this Section 3.6. It
is the intent of the parties hereto that the procedures set forth in this
Section 3.6 and the activities of the Independent Expert in connection
herewith are not (and should not be considered to be or treated as)
an arbitration proceeding or similar arbitral process and that no formal
arbitration rules should be followed (including rules with respect to
procedures and discovery). The Seller and the Purchaser will request that the
Independent Expert's determination be made within forty five (45) days after
its engagement, or as soon thereafter as possible, will be set forth in a
written statement delivered to the Purchaser and the Seller and will be final,
conclusive, non-appealable and binding for all purposes hereunder (other than
for fraud or manifest error), and the Purchaser and Seller shall provide
Release Instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section
3.3(d)(ii).

ARTICLE X 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

10.1 _Indemnification of Purchaser_. Subject to Sections 10.3 and
10.6 and the other provisions of this ARTICLE X, from and after the Closing
Date, the Indemnifying Party hereby, agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser, each of its Affiliates and each of its and their
respective members, managers, partners, directors, officers, employees,
shareholders, agents, successors and permitted assignees (the " _Indemnified
Party_ "), against and in respect of any and all losses, payments, interest,
demands, penalties, forfeitures, costs, expenses, Actions, Liabilities,
Taxes, Liens, judgments, deficiencies or damages (including actual costs of
investigation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and other reasonable
costs and expenses) but for the avoidance of doubt not including any such
amounts incurred in connection with any indemnification claim hereunder by a
Indemnified Party to the extent that such Indemnified Party is not successful
in such claim (all of the foregoing collectively, " _Losses_ ") paid,
suffered, incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon any Indemnified Party to
the extent arising in whole or in part out of or as a result of or in
connection with (whether or not involving a Third Party Claim):

  



  

(a) the failure of any representation or warranty of the Company and/or
the Seller contained herein to be true and correct as of the date hereof and
as of the Closing Date as if made at the Closing;

  



  

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant of the Company and/or
the Seller contained herein except for any breach of Section 6.3; or

  



  

(c) additional taxes payable to PRC tax authorities reflected in the
Company's audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December,
31 2018 in relation to the Company's used auto sales business resulting from a
materially different tax treatment as compared to the corresponding tax
treatment reflected in the Company's audited financial statements as of and
for the year ended December, 31 2017 (" _Special Tax Indemnity_ ");

  



  

(d) obligations incurred by the Purchaser relating to any contingent
consideration due and owing to the (i) Dealer Partners under the
Dealership Agreements and (ii) After Care Partners under the After Care
Agreements in the form of equity in the Company (" _Special Dealer Indemnity_
").

  



   

57

 



    



  

10.2 _Payment by the Escrow Agent_ Any amounts payable by the
Indemnifying Party hereunder after Final Resolution of any claim
for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE X (a " _Claim_ ") shall first be
paid with Accrued Dividends held in the Escrow Account, then with any cash or
cash equivalents that are held in the Escrow Account, then with the Escrow
Shares, and then with any remaining property in the Escrow Account. With
respect to any indemnification payment that includes Escrow Shares, the value
of each Escrow Share for purposes of determining the indemnification payment
shall be the Purchaser Share Price on the date that the indemnification claim
is finally determined in accordance with this ARTICLE X. For
successful indemnification Claims by an Indemnified Party, within five (5)
Business Days after Final Resolution, the Purchaser and the Seller will
provide the Escrow Agent with joint written instructions to disburse and
irrevocably surrender to Purchaser a number of Escrow Shares and other Escrow
Property equal to the amount provided in such Final Resolution with respect to
such Claim (as determined in accordance with this ARTICLE X) from the Escrow
Account (and the Purchaser and the Seller will provide or cause to be
provided to the Escrow Agent any written instructions or other information or
documents required by the Escrow Agent to do so). The Purchaser will cancel
any Escrow Shares surrendered to the Purchaser by the Escrow Agent promptly
after its receipt thereof. The Seller is deemed to have waived its entitlement
to any Accrued Dividend payable in respect of such Escrow Shares.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, only the
Earnout Payment paid pursuant to Section 3.4(c) shall be reduced by the
amount of any indemnification claims by any Indemnified Party under this
Article X, and only with respect to any such claims that (i) are pending, (ii)
have been finally determined as due and owing but are unpaid by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with this Article X or (iii) have been paid from the
Escrow Account in accordance with this Article X but have not previously been
used to reduce the amount of such Earnout Payment. No other Earnout Payments
shall be reduced with respect to indemnification claims by the Indemnified
Party. For the avoidance of doubt, (y) the Escrow Agent shall at all times
prior to the final determination of amounts payable pursuant to Section
3.4(a) and (b) retain sufficient Escrow Shares and Escrow Property to pay the
maximum possible amount payable to Seller thereunder, and (x) all amounts
payable by the Escrow Agent to Seller in respect Sections 3.4(a) and (b) shall
be paid to Seller, regardless of whether any Indemnified Party is entitled to
any Losses under any Claim, and shall not be reduced by any such Claim. In
the event that the conditions of Section 3.4(d) are satisfied, the Escrow
Shares and Escrow Property shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
the terms thereof. Upon the final determination of any such pending
indemnification claim, if the final amount determined to be payable to the
Indemnified Party is less than the amount reserved for such claim, then to
the extent that such pending claim reduced and would otherwise continue to
reduce the amount of the Earnout Payment (after first giving effect for other
reductions to the amount of such prior Earnout Payment pursuant to the
preceding sentence, including other pending indemnification claims, taking
into account the following events occurring after the time that the Earnout
Payment was initially reduced: (x) any adjustments to the claimed amount for
any other indemnification claims existing at such time; and (y) the amount of
any new pending or finally determined indemnification claims made since such
time), such amount of Escrow Property will be promptly thereafter disbursed by
the Escrow Agent to the Sellers (and Purchaser shall pay the Accrued
Dividends).

  



  

10.3 _Limitations and General Indemnification Provisions:_

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and
except for Fraud Claims and Special Indemnity Claims:

  



  

(i) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any Losses under a
Claim unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses under all Claims of
all Indemnified Party shall exceed US$3,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), at
which time those additional Losses incurred exceeding and excluding the
amount of the Deductible shall be subject to indemnification hereunder;

  



   

58

 



    



  

(ii) the Indemnifying Party's aggregate Liability for indemnification
pursuant to this ARTICLE X shall not exceed the value of 13,050,000 Escrow
Shares (the " _Indemnity Escrow Share Amount_ "), and any Losses that the
Indemnifying Party is entitled to recover pursuant to this ARTICLE X shall be
payable solely from the Escrow Shares and the Escrow Account in accordance
with this ARTICLE X;

  



  

(iii) in no event shall any Loss be recoverable under the terms of this
Agreement to the extent it consists of or is based upon punitive, special or
exemplary damages, except to the extent awarded to a third party in connection
with a Third Party Claim;

  



  

(iv) after the expiration of the Survival Period, the Indemnifying Party
shall have no further Liability for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE
X other than with respect to Claims already made as provided in this ARTICLE
X.

  



  

(b) In the event that any Released 2020 Escrow Property or Released
Provisional Indemnification Property is disbursed to the Seller, if there is
an indemnification claim against the Indemnifying Party that is finally
determined to be due and owing to an Indemnified Party in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, to the extent that there is insufficient Escrow
Property in the Escrow Account (with each Escrow Share valued at the
Purchaser Share Price) to pay for such indemnification claim in accordance
with this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for such
difference, provided that (except for Fraud Claims and Special Indemnity
Claims) the aggregate liability of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Section 10.3(b) shall not exceed the aggregate value of the Released 2020
Escrow Property and/or Released Provisional Indemnification Property that is
actually disbursed to the Seller (with each Escrow Share valued at the
Purchaser Share Price).

  



  

(c) No investigation or knowledge by an Indemnified Party or the
Purchaser or their respective representatives of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of an Indemnifying Party
shall affect the recourse available to the Indemnified Party under
this ARTICLE X.

  



  

(d) Promptly after an Indemnified Party becomes aware of any event or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to constitute or give rise to
any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Warrantors
contained in this Agreement or any other claim for indemnification pursuant
to this ARTICLE X, the Indemnified Party shall take all commercially
reasonable steps to mitigate and minimize all Losses that could result from
or relate to such breach or claim.

  



  

10.4 _Procedure_. The following shall apply with respect to all
claims by any Indemnified Party for indemnification:

  



  

(a) In the event any Indemnified Party desires to make a Claim,
Purchaser shall deliver a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the
Indemnifying Party, setting forth (i) the nature of and factual and legal
basis for the Claim in reasonable detail and (ii) the aggregate amount of
Losses for which indemnification is being sought that have been incurred, or
to the extent not yet incurred, a good faith estimate of the amount of such
Losses reasonably expected to be incurred (the " _Claim Amount ")_. Any Claim
Amount or any other matter set forth in a Claim Notice will be deemed to be
finally resolved for purposes of this ARTICLE X when (A) resolved by a
written agreement executed by Purchaser, the Company and the Seller or (B)
resolved by a final, nonappealable order, decision or ruling of a court of
competent jurisdiction or arbitrator (clauses (A) and (B), together, a "
_Final Resolution_ ").

  



   

59

 



    



  

(b) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party, as
applicable, prompt notice (and within no more than 10 days) of any
Third Party Claim with respect to which such Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1 (a " _Third Party Claim Notice_ ")
which include the same information as a Claim Notice. The failure to give the
Third- Party Claim Notice shall not impair any of the rights or benefits of
such Indemnified Party to indemnification under this ARTICLE X, except to
the extent such failure actually prejudices any right, defense or claim
available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices
and documents (including court papers) received from the counterparty in such
third party Action by the Indemnified Party relating to the claim.

  



  

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to exercise full
control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim by
written notice to Purchaser within sixty (60) days of delivery of the Third
Party Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such
Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 10.4(c), then the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in any manner reasonably
requested in connection with the defense, and the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to be kept reasonably informed by the Indemnifying Party and its
legal counsel with respect to the status of any legal proceedings, to the
extent not inconsistent with the preservation of attorney-client or work
product privilege. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the defense of any
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense,
compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed to pay such fees and
expenses, or (ii) the named parties to such Third Party Claim (including any
impleaded parties) include an Indemnified Party and counsel for Purchaser and
the Indemnifying Party agrees that there is an actual conflict of interest
between such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with
the defense thereof, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of
such separate counsel shall be Losses eligible for submission in a Claim,
subject to the other terms of this ARTICLE X. The Indemnifying Party shall
seek the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) to any settlement or compromise of any
Third Party Claim to the extent such settlement or compromise: (A) includes
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (B) involves the resolution
of criminal allegations against the Indemnified Party or (C) will impose
liability that will not be satisfied in full by the Indemnity Escrow Share
Amount or amounts or property from the Escrow Account.

  



  

(d) To the extent the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of Section 10.4(c),
Purchaser may elect to conduct such defense, using legal counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party will not settle
any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



   

60

 



    



  

10.5 _Insurance_. Any indemnification payments hereunder shall take
into account any insurance proceeds or other third party reimbursement
actually received. In the event that a recovery is made by an Indemnified
Party or any Affiliate of an Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses for
which such Indemnified Party has already been indemnified hereunder, then a
refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly
to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

10.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, except as expressly set forth otherwise,
this ARTICLE X shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Party from and after the Closing and shall be in lieu of any other remedies
that may be available to the Indemnified Party under any other agreement or
pursuant to any statutory or common law with respect to any Losses directly
or indirectly resulting from or arising out of any claims arising under this
Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
sentence shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific
performance or injunctive relief, or any right or remedy arising by reason of
any Fraud Claims.

  



  

10.7 _Survival of Indemnification Rights_. All representations and
warranties of the Warrantors contained in this Agreement (including
all schedules and exhibits hereto and all certificates, documents,
instruments and undertakings furnished pursuant to this Agreement) shall
survive the Closing through and until April 30, 2021 (the " _Survival Period_
"); provided, however, that Fraud Claims against the Warrantors shall survive
indefinitely, and that claims in respect of the Special Tax Indemnity
shall survive until April 30, 2019. If written notice of a claim for breach
of any representation or warranty has been given before the applicable date
when such representation or warranty no longer survives in accordance with
this Section 10.7, then the relevant representations and warranties shall
survive as to such claim, until the claim has been finally resolved. All
covenants, obligations and agreements of the Warrantors contained in this
Agreement (including all schedules and exhibits hereto and all
certificates, documents, instruments and undertakings furnished pursuant to
this Agreement), including any indemnification obligations, shall survive the
Closing and continue until fully performed in accordance with their terms.

(h) The parties agree that all costs and expenses (including counsel
fees) of any such arbitration shall be borne by the non-prevailing party, and
the non-prevailing party waives its right to seek an order compelling the
prevailing party to pay its portion of its costs and expenses (including
counsel fees) for any arbitration. The determination of a majority of the
Arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties and not subject to
appeal.

  



  

(i) Any judgment upon any award rendered by the Arbitrators may be
entered in and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties
expressly consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the
Arbitrators to arbitrate any and all matters to be submitted to arbitration
hereunder pursuant to the terms hereof. None of the parties hereto shall
challenge any arbitration hereunder on the grounds that any party necessary
to such arbitration (including the parties hereto) shall have been absent
from such arbitration for any reason, including that such party shall have
been the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency proceeding.

  



  

(j) The parties to the arbitration may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or
other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without breach of this
arbitration provision and without abridgement of the powers of the

Agreement.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENT. NO PARTY SHALL BE AWARDED PUNITIVE OR OTHER EXEMPLARY

AGREEMENT.

  



   

62

 



    



  

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that each has
been represented in connection with the signing of this waiver by
independent legal counsel selected by the respective party and that such
party has discussed the legal consequences and import of this waiver with
legal counsel. Each of the parties to this Agreement further acknowledge that
each has read and understands the meaning of this waiver and grants this
waiver knowingly, voluntarily, without duress and only after consideration of
the consequences of this waiver with legal counsel.

without liability to the other party.

13.2 _Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement cannot be amended, except by a writing signed by
each party, and cannot be terminated orally or by course of conduct. No
provision hereof can be waived, except by a writing signed by the party
against whom such waiver is to be enforced, and any such waiver shall apply

Agreements, sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous understandings and agreements related thereto (whether

Agreement or any Additional Agreement may be explained or qualified by any
agreement, negotiations, understanding, discussion, conduct or course of
conduct or by any trade usage. Except as otherwise expressly stated herein or
any Additional Agreement, there is no condition precedent to the effectiveness
of any provision hereof or thereof. No party has relied on any representation

provision as is lawful.

  



  

13.11 _Construction of certain terms and references; captions_. In this
Agreement:

  



  

(a) References to particular sections and subsections, schedules, and
exhibits not otherwise specified are cross-references to sections and
subsections, schedules, and exhibits of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The words "herein," "hereof," "hereunder," and words of similar
import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision
of this Agreement, and, unless the context requires otherwise, "party" means
a party signatory hereto.

  



  

(c) Any use of the singular or plural, or the masculine, feminine, or
neuter gender, includes the others, unless the context otherwise requires;
"including" means "including without limitation;" "or" means "and/or;" "any"
means "any one, more than one, or all;" and, unless otherwise specified, any
financial or accounting term has the meaning of the term under United States
generally accepted accounting principles as consistently applied
heretofore by the Company.

  



  

(d) Unless otherwise specified, any reference to any agreement
(including this Agreement), instrument, or other document includes all
schedules, exhibits, or other attachments referred to therein, and any
reference to a statute or other law includes any rule, regulation, ordinance,
or the like promulgated thereunder, in each case, as amended, restated,
supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time. Any reference to a
numbered schedule means the same-numbered section of the disclosure schedule.
Any reference in a schedule contained in the disclosure schedules delivered
by a party hereunder shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the applicable representations and
warranties (or applicable covenants) that are contained in the section of
this Agreement that corresponds to such schedule and any other representations
and warranties of such party that are contained in this Agreement to which
the relevance of such item thereto is reasonably apparent on its face. The
mere inclusion of an item in a schedule as an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item would
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect,
as applicable, or establish any standard of materiality to define further the
meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.

  



   

67

 



    



  

(e) If any action is required to be taken or notice is required to be
given within a specified number of days following a specific date or event,
the day of such date or event is not counted in determining the last day for
such action or notice. If any action is required to be taken or notice is
required to be given on or before a particular day which is not a Business
Day, such action or notice shall be considered timely if it is taken or given
on or before the next Business Day.

  



  

(f) Captions are not a part of this Agreement, but are included for
convenience, only.

  



  

(g) For the avoidance of any doubt, all references in this Agreement to
"the knowledge or best knowledge of the Company" or similar terms shall be
deemed to include the actual or constructive (e.g., implied by Law) knowledge
of the Key Personnel.

  



  

13.12 _Further Assurances_. Each party shall execute and deliver such
documents and take such action, as may reasonably be considered within the
scope of such party's obligations hereunder, necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Additional Agreements.

  



  

13.13 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
provision hereof confers any benefit or right upon or may be enforced by any
Person not a signatory hereto.

  



  

13.14 _Waiver_. Reference is made to the final IPO prospectus of the
Purchaser, dated October 25, 2017 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Company and the
Seller have read the Prospectus and understand that the Purchaser has
established the Trust Account for the benefit of the public shareholders of
the Purchaser and the underwriters of the IPO pursuant to the Trust Agreement
and that, except for a portion of the interest earned on the amounts held in
the Trust Account, the Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust Account
only for the purposes set forth in the Trust Agreement. For and in
consideration of the Purchaser agreeing to enter into this Agreement, the
Company and the Seller each hereby agrees that it does not have any right,
title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account
and hereby agrees that it will not seek recourse against the Trust Account
for any claim it may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of,
any negotiations, contracts or agreements with the Purchaser;  _provided_
that (x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Company's right
to pursue a claim against Purchaser for legal relief against monies or other
assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific performance or other
equitable relief in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including a claim for Purchaser to specifically
perform its obligations under this Agreement) so long as such claim would not
affect Purchaser's ability to fulfill its obligation to effectuate the
Purchaser Shareholder Redemption, and (y) nothing herein shall serve to limit
or prohibit any claims that the Company may have in the future against
Purchaser's assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including
any funds that have been released from the Trust Account upon completion of a
"Business Combination" as such term is defined in Purchaser's constitutional
documents (except such amounts that are paid or payable to shareholders of
Purchaser holding Purchaser Ordinary Shares sold in the IPO who shall have
elected to redeem their Purchaser Ordinary Shares pursuant to
Purchaser's constitutional documents) and any assets that have been purchased
or acquired with any such funds).

  



   

68

 



    



  

13.15 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may be enforced only against, and
any dispute, claim or controversy based upon, arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought only
against, the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth in this Agreement with
respect to such party. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, shareholder, agent, attorney,
advisor, lender or representative or Affiliate of any named party to this
Agreement (which Persons are intended third party beneficiaries of
this Section 13.15) shall have any liability (whether in contract or tort, at
law or in equity or otherwise, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose
liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any one or
more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of such named party or for any dispute, claim or
controversy based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.
