patents and other registrations for its Intellectual Property Rights herein,
and to enforce such Intellectual Property Rights against third parties.

 3. Consideration.

aggregate of US$200 million (the "Purchase Price") for all of the Purchased
Assets, to be paid as follows:

the Effective Date;

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

33% of the Purchase Price (US$66,666,666.67), in either cash or mutually-
agreeable investment instruments, on the date that is six (6) months following
the Effective Date; and 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

the balance of the Purchase Price (US$66,666,666.66), in either cash or
mutually-agreeable investment instruments, on the later of (i) the Transition
Date or (ii) eighteen (18) months after the Effective Date. If the Parties
disagree whether the Transition Date has occurred and cannot resolve such
dispute amicably within 30 days, the Parties will resolve such disagreement
solely by the decision of a reputable independent information technology
expert, selected by AMTRUST and subject to NATIONAL GENERAL's reasonable
consent, from a firm that has neither Party or its Affiliates as a client. The
Parties shall fully cooperate to provide such expert with sufficient
information to render its decision, which such expert shall do within 30 days
after its selection. 

(b) No Other Consideration. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Purchase Price shall provide full consideration for, and otherwise cover all
aspects of:



| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

the sale, transfer and conveyance of the Purchased Assets to NATIONAL GENERAL
hereunder; 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

GENERAL in Section 6(a)(i) below, and the Patent License in Section 6(a)(ii)
below; and 

 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

all NPS licensing fees accrued and owed by NATIONAL GENERAL under the Existing
Agreement on or after July 1, 2017. 

 

(c) Payment Matters. For clarity, the Purchase Price does not cover any of the
Retained Liabilities set forth in Section 5(a) below. The Purchase Price shall
be paid in cash by wire transfer or other method mutually agreed by the
Parties. If any payment date in Section 3(a)(ii) or 3(a)(iii) is not on a
business day, the payment will be due on the immediately following business
day.



(d) Collections - Undisputed Amounts. NATIONAL GENERAL agrees to reimburse
AMTRUST for all reasonable attorneys' fees and out-of-pocket expenses

 associated with AMTRUST collecting any undisputed amounts of the Purchase
Price owed by NATIONAL GENERAL hereunder.

4. Taxes. The SELLER shall be responsible for any transfer taxes due on the transactions consummated hereunder. 

5. Obligations Retained and Assumed; Termination of Existing Agreement.

(a) Liabilities Retained. PURCHASER agrees that it is obligated under this
Agreement to pay the following (and only the following) liabilities to SELLER
with respect to the Existing Agreement (collectively, the "Retained
Liabilities"): (i) NPS licensing fees accrued and owed by NATIONAL GENERAL
under the Existing Agreement before July 1, 2017; and (ii) any other fees
accrued and owed by NATIONAL GENERAL under the Existing Agreement as of the
Effective Date. The termination and release in Section 5(c) below shall not
limit or modify the above Retained Liabilities, which are an obligation of
NATIONAL GENERAL under this Agreement.

(b) Liabilities and Obligations Not Assumed. Except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement, PURCHASER does not, and shall not, retain, assume or otherwise
become obligated in any way to pay, any liabilities, debts or obligations of
SELLER whatsoever, including but not limited to: any liabilities or
obligations arising from SELLER's business or development activities that
relate to the Purchased Assets before the Effective Date; or any obligations,
duties, terms, provisions, liabilities, covenants or other responsibilities
associated with the Purchased Assets before the Effective Date, including,
without limitation, any license or other fees due to any third parties on or
for the Purchased Assets, that are not expressly outlined in Section 5(a)
above; or any liabilities, debts or other obligations that relate to any NPS
Dedicated Employee (defined in Section 8(g) below) who does not become a
Transferred Employee (defined in Section 8(g) below); or any liabilities,
debts or other obligations that relate to any Transferred Employee arising
from or related to activities or circumstances occurring before the Effective
Date. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, SELLER does not, and
shall not, retain or otherwise become obligated in any way to pay, any
liabilities, debts or obligations of PURCHASER whatsoever, including but not
limited to: any liabilities or obligations arising from PURCHASER's business
or development activities that relate to the Purchased Assets after the
Effective Date; or any obligations, duties, terms, provisions, liabilities,
covenants or other responsibilities associated with the Purchased Assets after
the Effective Date, including, without limitation, any license or other fees
due to any third parties on or for the Purchased Assets or any liabilities,
debts or other obligations that relate to any Transferred Employee arising
from or related to activities or circumstances occurring after the Effective
Date.

(c) Termination of Existing Agreement. The Parties hereby amend Section 11.5
of the Existing Agreement, such that none of its provisions deemed to survive
termination shall survive such event. As of the Effective Date, and effective
immediately after the above amendment, PURCHASER and SELLER hereby terminate
the Existing Agreement. Each Party hereby releases the other party from all
liabilities, obligations and claims (other than

 those for fees in Section 9.1) arising or accruing under the Existing
Agreement prior to the above termination, subject to Sections 5(a) and 8(f).
Each Party hereby agrees to use good faith efforts in addressing and resolving
any issues, claims or liabilities arising under or accruing under the Existing
Agreement, including any outstanding accounts. Further, for any Hardware or
licenses that NATIONAL GENERAL paid for under the Existing Agreement that will
not be used by NATIONAL GENERAL after the Effective Date in connection with
the Purchased Assets or AMTRUST License, the Parties agree to use good faith
efforts to credit NATIONAL GENERAL with such payments as an offset to the
costs paid by NATIONAL GENERAL for Transition Services in Section 8(c)(iii),
taking into account the effect of any depreciation of any such Hardware or
licenses.

6. Required AMTRUST Programs and Patent Licenses. 

(a) AMTRUST License Grant. (i) AMTRUST hereby grants to NATIONAL GENERAL, and
NATIONAL GENERAL hereby accepts, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
fully paid-up, perpetual, sublicensable (subject only to Section 6(b) below)

from, reproduce, distribute, perform, display and otherwise fully utilize and
exploit, each on an internal basis only, the Required AMTRUST Programs solely
in connection with and as necessary to operate the NPS System, including,
without limitation, any Future NPS System. For clarity, the above license does
not include any trademark rights with respect to "ANA" or "AMTRUST," and
PURCHASER agrees not to make any public use (or use that is visible to any
third parties) of such trademark in connection with its use of the Required
AMTRUST Programs (subject to a reasonable wind down period for any uses of ANA
that are existing in the Required AMTRUST Programs, as provided by AMTRUST

commercial auto) represents ninety percent (90%) or greater of its total
insurance business activities) solely as part of a contemporaneous and
coterminous license to the NPS System (or any Future NPS System, as
applicable), such third party license to be limited to end-use rights only and
solely as necessary for such third party to use the NPS System. NATIONAL

 GENERAL is liable to AMTRUST herein for any action by a sublicensee that would
breach this Agreement if committed by NATIONAL GENERAL.

(c) Assignment Rights. NATIONAL GENERAL may sell, transfer and/or assign its
AMTRUST License and Patent License solely to the successor or acquirer of any
or all of its businesses (or the equity of the entities owning such

including its personal lines businesses, provided that NATIONAL GENERAL is
also contemporaneously selling, transferring and/or assigning to the successor
or acquirer the NPS System (or any future NPS System, as applicable) and any
such successor or acquirer may not extend the benefits of such AMTRUST License
or such Patent License to its or its Affiliates' commercial lines businesses

create additional items of the following, to the extent the following do not

7. License Back to AMTRUST.

(a) Grant. NATIONAL GENERAL hereby grants to AMTRUST, and AMTRUST hereby
accepts, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, perpetual,
sublicensable (subject only to Section 7(b) below) and assignable (subject
only to Section 7(c) below) license in and to exercise all Intellectual
Property Rights in the NPS System, with full rights to use, modify, make
derivative works from, reproduce, distribute, perform, display and otherwise
fully utilize and exploit, each on an internal basis only, the NPS System as

its current (and future, solely with respect to entities created as part of an
internal organization) Affiliates, and (ii) its and its Affiliates' respective

businesses) to which the License Back relates, provided that any such
successor or acquirer may not extend the benefits of such License Back to its
and its Affiliates' other businesses.

(d) No Other Rights. AMTRUST acknowledges and agrees that the License Back
does not convey title to, or ownership of, the NPS System to AMTRUST or any of
its Affiliates or customers. NATIONAL GENERAL acknowledges and agrees that the
AMTRUST License and Patent License does not convey title to, or ownership of,
the Required AMTRUST Programs or The '861 Patent Rights to NATIONAL GENERAL or
any of its Affiliates or customers. For clarity, the AMTRUST License and
License Back shall not include any rights or licenses to use any Intellectual
Property Rights (and/or any delivery requirements for Technology) of the other
Party created after the Effective Date, except as set forth in any Development
Agreement or the Project Plan.

8. Transition of NPS System. 

(a) Transition Services. AMTRUST shall be responsible for separating the NPS
System from its current (as of the Effective Date) operating environment, and
reestablishing the NPS System per the Project Plan to operate in NATIONAL
GENERAL's system environment in a manner consistent with past practices prior
to the Effective Date, including maintaining all current (as of the Effective
Date) substantive features and functionality of the NPS System in such
environment (the "Transition Services").

(b) Cooperation/Project Plan. The Parties shall execute the Project Plan
within 45 days after the Effective Date. NATIONAL GENERAL shall provide all
reasonable cooperation and assistance to AMTRUST for its performance of the
Transition Services and Support Services and all of its obligations in the
Project Plan. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, NATIONAL
GENERAL will, at its sole expense: (i) provide all Hardware, security and
third-party Technology; (ii) hire all dedicated employees as are required to
support the NPS System and Required AMTRUST Programs; and (iii) implement all
Hardware requirements (including bandwidth) reasonably recommended by AMTRUST
to mirror AMTRUST's current Hardware supporting the NPS System and Required
AMTRUST Programs as of the Effective Date.

(c) Costs. NATIONAL GENERAL agrees to pay AMTRUST for the Transition Services,
excluding out of pocket expenses (which will be reimbursed as set forth in
Section 8(d) below), as follows:

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

One Hundred percent (100%) of AMTRUST's actual costs (subject to the first
sentence of Section 8(d)) incurred in providing the Transition Services up to
US$5,000,000 (the "Cap") and 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

After the actual costs of the Transition Services reach the Cap, if the
Transition Services are not completed in accordance with the Project Plan to
NATIONAL 

 GENERAL's reasonable satisfaction, AMTRUST shall solely bear all expenses for
further Transition Services required to reach the Transition Date, to be
reimbursed by NATIONAL GENERAL to the extent any such expenses are due to the
failure of NATIONAL GENERAL to comply with the Project Plan or its obligations
in Section 8(b).

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

NATIONAL GENERAL shall pay for all costs incurred by AMTRUST to provide and
use Hardware for the performance of Transition Services that are incremental
to AMTRUST's Hardware costs to provide services under the Existing Agreement
prior to the Effective Date. AMTRUST shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to consult with NATIONAL GENERAL before incurring any such Hardware costs.
These costs shall not be included in the calculation of the Cap. 

| 
---|--- 

(iv)

|

For clarity, AMTRUST's costs in providing Support Services as set forth in
Section 9(b) shall not be included in the calculation of the Cap. 

(d) Costs and Expenses. AMTRUST's actual costs shall include the compensation
and benefits for any current employee or independent contractor providing the
applicable Transition Services or Support Services, pro-rated for any person
providing less than 100% of his or her working hours. NATIONAL GENERAL agrees
to reimburse AMTRUST without mark-up or premium for all reasonable and
necessary travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
providing Transition Services and Support Services. Upon request, AMTRUST will
provide reasonable documentation to support such expenses. NATIONAL GENERAL
shall be responsible for any sales taxes, use taxes, goods and services taxes
which are applicable to the Transition Services and Support Services. AMTRUST
shall be responsible for all other taxes and charges, including taxes on its
net income, that are based on AMTRUST's net profit arising from its
performance of the Transition Services and Support Services.

(e) Payments. All payments due under this Section 8 and Section 9 shall be
payable in full within sixty (60) days of NATIONAL GENERAL's receipt of an
invoice from AMTRUST. All invoices shall reference this Agreement, and any
payment of an invoice by NATIONAL GENERAL is without prejudice to its right to
contest its accuracy. Each Party shall maintain complete and accurate records
relating to the performance of Support Services and shall provide same to the
other Party upon request.

(f) BPO Services. In addition to Transition Services, AMTRUST agrees to
provide to NATIONAL GENERAL printing, lockbox and software hosting services
("BPO Services") in a manner consistent with past practices prior to the
Effective Date until they are fully transitioned to NATIONAL GENERAL. The
initial BPO Services to be provided and respective fees for same are attached
hereto as Schedule C. The Parties agree to meet as soon as possible after the
Effective Date, and in any event no more than forty-five (45) days after the
same, to agree in writing to the migration and/or transition process, which
will include a detailed project plan with milestones, deliveries, and proof
points mutually agreed upon by the Parties to accomplish the BPO Services
transition, such agreement to

 supersede Schedule C. The termination and release in Section 5(c) shall not
limit or modify AMTRUST's above obligation to provide BPO Services, which are
an obligation of AMTRUST under this Agreement.

(g) Employee Matters; Transferred Employees. NATIONAL GENERAL shall (i) offer
employment to current (as of the Effective Date) AMTRUST employees and (ii)
assume all engagement contracts for current (as of the Effective Date) AMTRUST
contractors, in each case, whom the Parties mutually agree are dedicating
substantially all of their time to the development, operation and maintenance
of the NPS System (each an "NPS Dedicated Person"), upon terms substantially
similar to their current compensation packages and including standard NATIONAL
GENERAL benefits. Within three (3) business days after the Effective Date,
NATIONAL GENERAL shall offer employment to each NPS Dedicated Person who is a
current employee, and the Parties shall cooperate to assign the engagement
contracts for each NPS Dedicated Person who is a current contractor to
NATIONAL GENERAL. In the event a NPS-Dedicated Person declines an offer of
employment from NATIONAL GENERAL (or refuses to perform under the applicable
engagement contract), AMTRUST agrees not to retain such NPS-Dedicated Person.
Further, AMTRUST will not rehire any NPS-Dedicated Person for three years
after the Effective Date. If AMTRUST is required to pay any paid time off
compensation or incur other out-of-pocket expenses to transfer the NPS
Dedicated Persons, NATIONAL GENERAL shall reimburse same at cost. For purposes
of this Agreement, each NPS Dedicated Person who agrees to become an employee
of NATIONAL GENERAL following the Effective Date shall be referred to herein
as a "Transferred Employee". All such Transferred Employees shall begin
working for NATIONAL GENERAL as quickly as is reasonably possible, and in any
event no later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date.

9. Support. 

(a) Current Environment Costs. After the Effective Date and until the
Transition Date (the "Pre-Transition Support Period"), upon request of
NATIONAL GENERAL, AMTRUST shall provide NATIONAL GENERAL software and system
support for the NPS System and the Required AMTRUST Programs to assist
NATIONAL GENERAL to continue its use of and otherwise operate the NPS System
and utilize the Required AMTRUST Programs in a manner consistent with past
practices prior to the Effective Date while the separation and re-
establishment as part of the Transition Services is effected (the "Pre-
Transition Support").

(b) For a maximum of twelve (12) months beginning on the Transition Date (the
"Post-Transition Support Period"), upon request of NATIONAL GENERAL, AMTRUST
shall provide NATIONAL GENERAL software and system support for the NPS System
and the Required AMTRUST Programs to assist NATIONAL GENERAL to effectuate the
AMTRUST License, continue its use of, and otherwise operate the NPS System and
utilize the Required AMTRUST Programs, in each case, in a manner consistent
with past practice (the "Post-Transition Support", and together with the Pre-
Transition Support, the "Support Services"). NATIONAL GENERAL agrees to pay
AMTRUST's actual costs and out-of-

 pocket expenses for performing all Support Services as set forth in Section
8(d), such costs and expenses to be consistent with past practices between the
Parties (i.e., the same or similar rates and amounts for such services will
apply).

(c) AMTRUST agrees to perform all Support Services under this Agreement: (i)
using personnel of required skill, experience and qualifications; (ii) in a
professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with generally recognized
industry standards for similar services; and (iii) in compliance with all
applicable laws.

10\. Limited Development Obligations. Absent NATIONAL GENERAL's prior written
consent (which may be withheld in NATIONAL GENERAL's sole discretion), AMTRUST
will not market, offer, provide to, or develop for, any third party a personal
lines insurance policy management system (as a standalone system or combined
with another policy management system): (a) of any kind, for three (3) years
after the Effective Date; or (b) that contains any source code contained in
the NPS System, at any time after the Effective Date. For clarity, AMTRUST
will not be restricted at any time after the Effective Date from using or
developing any policy management system solely for its (and its respective
Affiliates') own internal business purposes or from developing systems for
third parties that do not violate any term or condition of this Agreement,
including AMTRUST's obligations under this Section 10. For further clarity,

16.Miscellaneous.

(a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with its schedules, constitutes
the entire agreement of the Parties hereto regarding the subject matter
covered herein, and all prior agreements, understandings, representations and
statements, oral or written, regarding same are superseded hereby.

(b) Captions. Section captions used in this Agreement are for convenience
only, and do not affect the construction of this Agreement.

(c) Counterpart Execution. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
together constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by electronic transmission
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart thereof and
shall be deemed an original signature for all purposes.

(d) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall for any reason be
held to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall
not affect any other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be
construed as if such invalid or unenforceable provision had never been
contained in this Agreement.

(e) Further Assurances. At any time or from time to time after the Effective
Date, without further consideration, each Party shall, at the request of the
other Party, execute and deliver such further instruments and document as the
other Party may reasonably request to evidence or effect the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f)Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by PURCHASER and
SELLER. No waiver by a Party hereto of any default or breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to
any prior or subsequent default or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence.

(g)Arbitration.

(i) General. Any disputes between the Parties as to the interpretation or any
provision of this Agreement or the rights and obligations of any Party
hereunder shall be resolved solely through binding arbitration as provided
herein in New York, New York.

 (ii) Selection of Arbitrators. If arbitration is required to resolve a dispute
between the Parties, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to select one
(1) arbitrator for same. If the Parties are unable to agree on the selection
of an arbitrator, the Parties will notify the New York office of the American
Arbitration Association (the "AAA") and request the AAA to select the
arbitrator.

(iii) Rules of Arbitration. The arbitrator selected pursuant to Section
16(g)(ii) above will follow the AAA rules for commercial arbitration, which
will be binding on the Parties.

(iv) Costs of Arbitration. The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority to
determine and award in its sole discretion costs of arbitration and the costs
incurred by each Party for its attorneys, advisors and consultants.

(v) Award of Arbitrator. Any award made by the arbitrators shall be binding
upon the Parties and shall be enforceable to the fullest extent of the law.

(vi) Governing Law; Actual Damages. This Agreement is governed by the laws of
the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflict of
laws of same. Except as permitted under Section 16(g)(iv) above, the
arbitrators' award will be limited to actual damages and will not include
punitive or exemplary damages. Without limiting Section 16(d), nothing
contained in this Agreement will be deemed to give the arbitrators any
authority, power or right to alter, change, amend, modify, add to or subtract
from any provisions of this Agreement. All privileges under state and federal
law, including, without limitation, attorney-client work product and party
communication privileges, shall be preserved and protected.

(h)Injunctive relief. The Parties agree that any breach or threatened breach
of Sections 6(b), 6(c), 7(b), 7(c) and 16(l) shall cause a Party irreparable
harm that is incapable of remedy by money damages, and that in such event, a
Party has the right to seek temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive or
equitable relief (including specific performance) from the arbitrator (or from
the courts located in New York, New York pending the resolution of any
arbitration hereunder) to enjoin or prevent same without posting bond or other
security.

(i)Construction. The Parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state,
local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
The word "including" shall mean "including without limitation."

(j)No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not confer any rights or
remedies upon any person or entity other than the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 (k)Successor and Assigns. In the event of a permitted assignment herein, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named
herein and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The Parties'
rights to assign this Agreement as a whole shall be consistent with their
assignment rights in Sections 6(c) and 7(c), and any assignments or
sublicenses not explicitly permitted by Sections 6(b), 6(c), 7(b), 7(c) or
this Section 16(k) require the prior written consent of the non-assigning
Party in its sole discretion. If NATIONAL GENERAL sells, assigns or transfers
the NPS System (or any of its Intellectual Property Rights within) or if
AMTRUST sells, assigns or transfers the Required AMTRUST Programs (or any of
its Intellectual Property Rights within), in each case, in whole or in part,
then in each case, the successor or acquirer is deemed automatically bound by
the assigning Party's licensing obligations herein and must also assume such
obligations in writing. Any purported assignment in violation of Sections 6(c)
or 7(c ) or this Section 16(k) (or any sublicense in violation of Sections
6(b) or 7(b)) shall be null and void at the outset and of no force or effect.

(l)Confidentiality; Press Releases.

(i) Before releasing a press release or other public disclosure announcing the
transactions covered by this Agreement, a Party shall provide a draft of same
to the other Party for review, input and consent. The Parties agree to
cooperate in good faith to review, provide input and consider in good faith
any such input, prior to releasing such proposed disclosure.

(ii) NATIONAL GENERAL agrees to protect the source code, and other materials
marked as "Confidential" or "Proprietary" (or that a reasonable person would
understand to be confidential) for the Required AMTRUST Programs provided to
NATIONAL GENERAL hereunder with the same level of security NATIONAL GENERAL
accords to its own most sensitive source code and/or materials of a similar
nature, and in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. NATIONAL
GENERAL shall not authorize or permit any Required AMTRUST Programs, or any
portion thereof, to become governed by or subject to an "open source" or
similar license that could require NATIONAL GENERAL to license or make its
source code available if any Required AMTRUST Programs are made available,
licensed, conveyed, or distributed to third parties.

(iii) AMTRUST agrees to protect the source code, and other materials marked as
"Confidential" or "Proprietary" (or that a reasonable person would understand
to be confidential) for the NPS System that are part of the Retained Copies or
provided to NATIONAL GENERAL hereunder with the same level of security AMTRUST
accords to its own most sensitive source code and/or materials of a similar
nature, and in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. AMTRUST shall
not authorize or permit the NPS System, or any portion thereof, to become
governed by or subject to an "open source" or similar license that could
require AMTRUST to license or make its source code available if any NPS System
is made available, licensed, conveyed, or distributed to third parties.

 (iv) The restrictions of Sections 16(l)(ii) and 16(l)(iii) above with respect
to confidentiality shall not be deemed to limit the Parties' sublicensing and
assignment rights permitted hereunder, provided that all sublicensees and
assignees are subject to written obligations reflecting such restrictions and
that each of the Parties remains ultimately liable to the other Party for
breaches of same by its sublicensees.

(v) The restrictions of confidentiality herein shall not apply to any
disclosures that are required by applicable law, statute, rule, regulation,
court order, subpoena, document demand or legal process or to enforce a
Party's rights in this Agreement, provided that the required Party shall
notify the other Party as soon as legally permitted and cooperate with all
attempts by the other Party to obtain a protective order or similar treatment.

(m) Term. The term of this Agreement commences as of the Effective Date and
lasts in perpetuity. Without limiting the Parties' other rights and remedies
herein, the Parties agree that termination shall not be a remedy for a Party's
breach of this Agreement.
