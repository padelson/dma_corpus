conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence, within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together
with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_
"), the Offer; _provided_ , that the Company agrees that no shares of Company
Common Stock owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary will be tendered
pursuant to the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to
cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the
conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (as they may be amended in accordance with
this Agreement, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Merger Sub expressly reserves the
right, at any time, to, in its sole discretion, waive, in whole or in part,
any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not
(i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer,
(ii) reduce the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to
the conditions set forth in  _Exhibit A_ or (v) modify or change the Offer,
including any Offer Condition, in a manner that is adverse to any holders of
Company Common Stock.

 



2 (b) _Expiration of the Offer_. The Offer shall expire at midnight at the end
of the date that is twenty (20) business days after the commencement of the
Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange Act) (such time, or
such subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Time_ " and
such date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is
extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration
Date_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the provisions of
ARTICLE VIII, (i) if at the Expiration Time, any Offer Condition shall not
have been satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted under applicable Law),
Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, without the consent of the Company,
extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of not more than ten
(10) Business Days each (the length of such period to be determined by Parent
or Merger Sub), until the earlier of (A) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (B) the Outside Date and (ii) if at the
Expiration Time, any Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or waived
(to the extent permitted under applicable Law), Merger Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to), extend the Offer at the request of the Company for
one or more consecutive increments of not more than ten (10) Business Days
each (the length of such period to be determined by Parent or Merger Sub
after consultation with the Company), until the earlier of (A) the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (B) the Outside Date.
Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), the staff thereof or the NASDAQ Stock
Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") applicable to the Offer or as may be required by any
other Governmental Entity; _provided_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required
to extend the Offer to a date later than the Outside Date. Nothing contained
in this _Section 1.1(b)_ shall affect any termination rights in ARTICLE
VIII.

(c) _Offer Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement (including the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in _Exhibit A_ ), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i)
accept for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer prior to 9:00 a.m. New York City
time, on the business day (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange
Act) immediately following the Expiration Time and (ii) pay for all such
shares (subject to any applicable Tax withholding pursuant to _Section
3.2(h)_) as soon as practicable after the Expiration Time. The Offer Price
payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without interest,
on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. Acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the
conditions of the Offer upon the expiration of the Offer is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ," and the date on which the Offer
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing
Date_."

 

(d) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "),
which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal
and summary advertisement, a notice of appraisal rights as contemplated by

 



3  Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL and other appropriate ancillary offer
documents (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to
which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), and cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as and to the extent required
by United States federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly furnish
to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company required by
the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub
shall cause the Schedule TO and the other Offer Documents to comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and all other applicable Law. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to
cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as soon
as reasonably practicable and as and to the extent required by applicable
United States federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents,
and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all
correspondence between them and their Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination
thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of
the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub shall
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments.

(e) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the consideration necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for,
pursuant to the Offer.

 

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

owners of shares of Company Common Stock, in each case as of the latest date
practicable, and shall furnish to Parent and Merger Sub such information and
assistance (including periodically updated lists of stockholders, security
position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to holders of Company Common Stock. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to

Section 1.3 _Directors_.

 

(a) Effective upon the Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter, subject
to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder, Parent shall be entitled to designate the number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board that equals the
product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving
effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this _Section
1.3_) and (ii) the percentage of the total outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock beneficially

 



5  owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub (including shares accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer), and the Company shall cause ParentÂ’s designees to be
elected or appointed to the Company Board, including by increasing the number
of directors, filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Company
Board, and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors (with
such method to be by the election of Parent, including the selection of the
individuals designated for resignation). At each such time, the Company shall
also cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the proportional
number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (A) each committee
of the Company Board and (B) as requested by Parent, the board of directors
(or equivalent governing body) and each committee thereof of each Company
Subsidiary that represents the same percentage as such individuals represent
on the Company Board.

(b) The CompanyÂ’s obligations to appoint ParentÂ’s designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall, upon request of Parent at any time
following the Offer Closing, promptly take all actions necessary to effect the
appointment of ParentÂ’s designees and as required pursuant to Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill
its obligations under this _Section 1.3(b)_, including mailing to its
stockholders the Information Statement. Parent shall supply to the Company
any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors
and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this  _Section 1.3_ are in
addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of Merger Sub, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of
Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following
the appointment or election of ParentÂ’s designees pursuant to this _Section
1.3_ (if applicable) and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of
a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office (or, if there shall only
be one (1) or two (2) Continuing Directors then in office, all of such
Continuing Directors then in office) shall be required to authorize the
Company to (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the
Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any
action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize
the Company to, except as otherwise required by Law) (i) amend or terminate
this Agreement, (ii) waive any of the CompanyÂ’s rights or remedies under this
Agreement, (iii) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub, (iv) amend the Company Organizational
Documents (except to the extent provided for by this Agreement), (v)
authorize any agreement between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, or (vi) make any other
consent by the Company with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that any such
authorization shall not be effective unless there is in office at least one
(1) Continuing Director.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Continuing Director_ " shall mean a
member of the Company Board who is a member of the Company Board on the date
of this Agreement and who is an independent director, and eligible to serve on
the CompanyÂ’s audit committee, for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange
Act and the continuing listing

 



6  requirements of NASDAQ. If the number of directors who are Continuing
Directors is reduced to below three (3) prior to the Effective Time, the
remaining Continuing Directors shall be entitled to designate an individual
to fill such vacancy who is not a current or former officer, director,
employee or consultant of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Parent Insider_ ") and who shall be deemed a
Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement, and the Company shall
cause such designee to be appointed to the Company Board. If, notwithstanding
compliance with the foregoing provisions, the number of Continuing Directors
of the Company is reduced to zero prior to the Effective Time, then the other
directors on the Company Board shall designate and appoint to the Company
Board three (3) individuals who are not Parent Insiders who shall be deemed
to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. The Continuing
Directors shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include
current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the reasonable expense
of the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors to advise them in
their capacity as directors of the Company and shall have the authority to
institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this
Agreement or any of the CompanyÂ’s rights hereunder, in each case to the
extent reasonably appropriate to the exercise and discharge of their fiduciary
and other duties.

State of Delaware, or at such subsequent date and time as may be agreed in
writing by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger.
The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Effective Time_."

at the Effective Time.

 

Section 2.6 _Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of the

8 ARTICLE III

 

 _EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of Company Common Stock:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
(i) shares owned by Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Guarantor, (ii) shares to be
canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and (iii) the Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted into the right to receive, in cash and without interest, an
amount equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") upon surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_ and in compliance therewith. As of the Effective
Time, each share of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each
holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

 

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, $0.01
par value, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
$0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation. In addition to the foregoing
conversion, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall issue
245,000 shares to Parent in consideration for the deposit of the Merger
Consideration with the Paying Agent. The shares of the Surviving
Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub common stock are so converted
and the 245,000 shares issued to Parent shall be the only shares of the
Surviving Corporation that are issued and outstanding immediately after the
Effective Time.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share, if any, of Company Common
Stock that is held by the Company as a treasury share and each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company (other than on behalf of
third parties) or Parent or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of the Company or Parent shall be canceled without any conversion, and
no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall engage a
financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to act as paying agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time, the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of the
Company Common Stock, it being understood that any and all interest or other
amounts earned with respect to such funds shall be for the account of and
turned over to Parent in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_. All cash deposited
with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_."

 



9 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail,
promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3)
Business Days following the Effective Time), to each holder of record of (i) a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-
entry (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case, which at the Effective
Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1_, (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form and
with such other provisions as Parent may reasonably determine (which, in
the case of Certificates, shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (1) surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or receipt of an "agentÂ’s message" by the
Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent
may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and (2) such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of the Merger Consideration to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1_, and any Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. If the Merger Consideration is to be paid to any
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result
of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 3.2(b)_, each share of Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration upon such surrender.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE III shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this ARTICLE III.

 



10 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
ARTICLE III shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim
for the Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Paying
Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall not have been
surrendered prior to six (6) years after the Effective Time, any cash
remaining in the Exchange Fund at that time shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. If Parent determines to invest the Exchange
Fund, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to invest the Exchange Fund in
direct short-term obligations of, or obligations fully guaranteed by the full
faith and credit of, the United States of America or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by MoodyÂ’s Investors Service, Inc.
or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation, respectively, or a combination of the
foregoing, and, in each case, with maturities not exceeding three (3) months.
To the extent there are losses with respect to such investments or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for any other reasons below the level required to
make prompt cash payment of the aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant
to this Agreement, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
deposit additional funds held in the Exchange Fund such that the funds held
in the Exchange Fund are thereafter sufficient to satisfy the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub hereunder. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this ARTICLE III shall promptly be
paid to Parent.

(g) _Certain Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, in the event that, during the period between the date hereof and
the Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or
securities or a different class, including as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer or
other similar transaction, then the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and
any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_
that, in any case, nothing in this _Section 3.2(g)_ shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(h) _Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock, Company Options or Company Stock Awards such amounts as Parent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of

 



11  such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other
provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity by Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Common Stock, Company Options or Company Stock Awards to whom
such withheld amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making and
delivery of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and delivery of a
properly completed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, the
Merger Consideration as may be required pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Paying Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who properly exercise appraisal
rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be
entitled only to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262
unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose
their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such
right, such shares of Company Common Stock will thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company Common
Stock and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 3.4 _Treatment of Company Options, Company Stock Awards, ESPP and
Warrants_.

(a) _Company Options_. Each Company Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that is not then vested and exercisable,
shall become vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time. Effective as of
the Effective Time all Company Options outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and be of no further force or effect, and
in consideration for such cancellation of Company Options, the holders thereof
shall automatically (and without any further action being required on the part
of

 



12  the holders thereof) receive, at, or as soon as practicable following, the
Effective Time, an amount of cash equal to (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the vested portion of each such Company Option held
by such holder (after giving effect to the acceleration of vesting described
in this _Section 3.4(a)_) multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Merger Consideration over (B) the per-share exercise price under such Company
Option (with such payments to be subject to any applicable Tax withholding in
accordance with _Section 3.2(h)_).

 

(b) _Other Awards Under the Company Stock Plans_. Each award that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Stock
Plans other than the Company Options (the " _Company Stock Awards_ ") shall
become vested as of the Effective Time to the extent provided under the terms
of such Company Stock Award, and all such Company Stock Awards shall be
cancelled and be of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time. In
exchange for the cancellation of each Company Stock Award, the holder of each
Company Stock Award shall receive the Merger Consideration for each share
of Company Common Stock underlying the vested portion of the Company Stock
Award (after giving effect to the acceleration of vesting described in this
_Section 3.4(b)_), and with such payment to be subject to any applicable Tax
withholding in accordance with _Section 3.2(h)_.

(c) _ESPP_. Effective as of the business day immediately prior to the
Effective Time, but subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, the
current "Offering Period" outstanding under the CompanyÂ’s 2006 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") shall terminate, shares of
Company Common Stock shall be purchased under the Company ESPP by the Company
on behalf of the respective Company ESPP participants on the same basis as if
the Offering Period had expired on its originally scheduled date but treating
the business day immediately prior to the Effective Time as the "Exercise
Date" within the meaning of the Company ESPP, and the shares of Company Common
Stock so purchased shall be cancelled effective as of the Effective Time and
converted into a right of each respective Company ESPP participant to
receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (A) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock purchased on his or her behalf in
accordance with this _Section 3.4(c)_ multiplied by (B) the Merger
Consideration.

(d) _SVB Warrant_. As soon as practicable after the date hereof but no later
than ten (10) days prior to the Offer Closing Date, the Company shall notify
the holder of the SVB Warrant (the " _SVB Warrant Holder_ ") in writing in
accordance with the notice provision of the SVB Warrant of the Offer and
the Offer Closing Date (as anticipated on such date of notice). In the event
that the SVB Warrant Holder either (i) exercises the SVB Warrant by delivering
to the Company the Notice of Exercise (as defined in the SVB Warrant) and
paying the Warrant Price (as defined in the SVB Warrant) in each case
pursuant to the terms of Section 1.1 of the SVB Warrant prior to the Offer
Closing or (ii) converts the SVB Warrant pursuant to the terms of Section 1.2
of the SVB Warrant, then (x) the Company shall deliver to the SVB Warrant
Holder shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.4 of the
SVB Warrant and (y) effective as of the Offer Closing, the SVB Warrant shall
be cancelled and be of no further force or effect. The shares of Company
Common Stock received by the SVB Warrant Holder pursuant to the SVB Warrant
and this _Section 3.4(d)_ shall be treated as shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with  _Section 3.1_. In the event that the SVB Warrant Holder
either notifies the Company in writing that it does not intend to exercise or
convert the

 



13  SVB Warrant or does not inform the Company in writing prior to the Offer
Closing that it intends to exercise or convert the SVB Warrant in accordance
with the terms of the SVB Warrant prior to the Offer Closing, then the SVB
Warrant shall be treated in accordance with the terms thereof.

(e) _PIPE Warrants_. As soon as practicable after the date hereof but no
later than ten (10) days prior to the Offer Closing Date, the Company shall
notify the holders of the PIPE Warrants in writing in accordance with the
notice provision of the PIPE Warrants of the Offer and the Offer Closing Date
(as anticipated on such date of notice). The Company shall take all
commercially reasonable actions to ensure that each unexercised PIPE Warrant
outstanding as of the date hereof is exercised as soon as practicable
after the date hereof, but in any event prior to the Offer Closing Date in

any payment or benefit from the Company or any Company Subsidiary that would

Parent, Guarantor, the Company or any of the respective Affiliates shall be
required in order to resolve any objections asserted under Competition Laws by
any Governmental Entity with

 



51  respect to any of the Transactions to divest any of its businesses, product
lines or assets, hold separate or take or agree to take any other action or
agree to any limitation or restriction if such action would, or would
reasonably be expected to, materially and adversely impair the overall
benefits expected to be realized by Guarantor, Parent and their Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, from consummation of the Transactions (taking into account,
among other things, effects on the assets, business and operations and
relationships of both Parent and its Subsidiaries and of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) (any such action being referred to herein as an "
_Adverse Regulatory Requirement_ ").

Section 6.5 _No Solicitation; Company Recommendation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the
CompanyÂ’s and Company SubsidiariesÂ’ respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to a Company Takeover
Proposal, and shall promptly thereafter request the return from, or
destruction by, all such Persons of all copies of confidential information
previously furnished to such Persons by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
or the CompanyÂ’s and Company SubsidiariesÂ’ respective Representatives, in
connection with exploring any Company Takeover Proposal prior to the date
hereof. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and
the CompanyÂ’s and Company SubsidiariesÂ’ respective Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or

that constitute, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions (other than to refer to
this Agreement) or negotiations with any third party regarding any Company

into any merger or other agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent,
term sheet, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
instrument constituting or related to any Company Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if after the date hereof but prior to the Offer
Closing Date the Company Board receives an unsolicited, bona fide written
Company Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof but prior to the
Offer Closing Date, that did not result from or arise in connection with a
breach of this _Section 6.5(a)_ (other than an immaterial breach), and the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, then the Company may, if the Company
Board determines (after consultation with outside counsel) that failure to
take such actions would be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary
duties to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Law, and subject to
compliance with this _Section 6.5(a)_ and  _Section 6.5(b)_, at any time
prior to the Offer Closing Date (but in no event after the Offer Closing Date)
and after providing Parent not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior written
notice of such determination by the Company Board (A) furnish information
with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making
such Company Takeover Proposal, but only after such Person enters into a
customary confidentiality agreement with terms substantially similar to, and
with a standstill not less restrictive, and other provisions not less
restrictive (other than in an immaterial respect) than,

 



52  those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (including the "standstill"
covenant); _provided_ , that (1) such confidentiality agreement may not
include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the
Company and (2) the Company provides Parent, in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, any non-public information with respect to the
Company furnished to such other Person which was not previously furnished to
Parent prior to the time it is provided to such other Person, which
information shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) participate in discussions and negotiations
with such Person regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any Company Subsidiaries or the CompanyÂ’s or the
Company SubsidiariesÂ’ respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section 6.5_ by the Company.

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 6.5_, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in
writing (and in any case within forty-eight (48) hours of knowledge of
receipt) of the receipt by the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal, or
any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover
Proposal, or any request for information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books
or records of the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any third party with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, in any such notice
to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such Company Takeover
Proposal, indication or request, and the terms and conditions of such Company
Takeover Proposal, indication or request (and shall include with such notice
copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such
Person relating to such Company Takeover Proposal, indication or request),
and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed, in a prompt
manner, of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any
such Company Takeover Proposal, indication or request or any changes to the
material terms thereof (and the Company shall provide Parent promptly after
receipt or delivery thereof with copies of any additional written materials
received that relate to such Company Takeover Proposal, indication or request
or any changes to the material terms thereof) and of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. In addition, during the period from the date
hereof through the Effective Time, the Company shall enforce, and not
terminate, amend, modify or waive (except for waiver of any standstill
provisions to allow such counterparty to make a proposal to the Company Board)
any provision of any confidentiality agreement to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party.

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.5_, the Company Board
shall not (i) (A) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation, (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Company Takeover
Proposal or take any action or make any public statement that is expressly
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation or (C) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 (any action described in this
clause (i) a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or authorize
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger, acquisition,
purchase or joint venture agreement or other agreement constituting or related
to, or that is intended to or reasonably expected to lead to, any Company
Takeover Proposal (other

 



53  than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with _Section 6.5(a)_)
(each, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "). It is agreed that any violation
of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this _Section 6.5_ by any
officer or director of the Company (or any other Representative of the Company
that is authorized, intentionally sanctioned or intentionally caused by the
Company) shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 6.5_ by the Company.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject to
_Section 6.5(f)_, the Company Board may (i) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if (A) the Company Board determines (after consultation
with outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would be inconsistent
with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary duties to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under
applicable Law and (B) the Company Board (1) receives after the date hereof
but before the Offer Closing Date an unsolicited, bona fide written Company
Takeover Proposal that did not result from or arise in connection with a
breach of this _Section 6.5_ (other than an immaterial breach) and (2)
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and
authorizes the Company to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal and/or (ii) following or concurrently with
making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with clause (i)
and _Section 6.5(f),_ authorizes the Company to terminate this Agreement and
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement if, concurrently with entering
into such Company Acquisition Agreement, the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ and pays the Termination Fee required
pursuant to _Section 8.3_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject to
_Section 6.5(f)_, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change for a reason unrelated to a Company Takeover Proposal if
the Company Board determines (after consultation with outside counsel) that,
in light of material facts, events or circumstances in each case related to
the Company that have developed since the date of this Agreement that were
not known to the Company prior to the date hereto, failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary duties to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders under applicable Law.

(f) The Company Board shall not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to  _Section 6.5(d)_ or _Section 6.5(e)_ unless (i) the Company
promptly provides written notice to Parent at least three (3) Business Days
before taking such action (the " _Notice Period_ ") advising Parent that the
Company Board is considering making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
which notice shall (A) in the case of any action intended to be taken pursuant
to _Section 6.5(d)_, specify the identify the Person making such Company
Takeover Proposal, and include copies of any written materials relating to
such Company Takeover Proposal or (B) in the case of any action intended to be
taken pursuant to _Section 6.5(e)_, contain a reasonably
detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons
for taking, such action (the " _Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ ")
and (ii) during the Notice Period, the Company and its Representatives
shall have, if requested by Parent, negotiated in good faith with Parent and
ParentÂ’s Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms of this
Agreement as would enable Parent to proceed with the Transactions on such
adjusted terms and, at the end of such Notice Period, after taking into

 



54  account any such adjusted terms as may have been proposed by Parent since
its receipt of such written notice, the Company Board shall have again in good
faith made the determination referred to in clause (i)(B)(2) of _Section
6.5(d)_ or in _Section 6.5(e)_, as applicable. To the extent the Notice
Period described in the preceding sentence would expire after the Offer
Closing Date, the Offer Closing Date shall be automatically extended such
that it will occur on the first Business Day after the expiration of the
Notice Period. In the event of any material change (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any change in price) to the terms of a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, make the determination referred to
in clause (i)(B)(2) of _Section 6.5(d)_, deliver a new Company Notice of
Adverse Recommendation and commence a new Notice Period, except that the
duration of the Notice Period shall be reduced to 48 hours (rather than three
(3) Business Days).

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer (whether
in writing or otherwise) from any Person or "group" (as defined in Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating
to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or
a series of related transactions) of assets of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (including securities of the Company Subsidiaries) equal
to more than 15% of the CompanyÂ’s consolidated assets or to which more than
15% of the CompanyÂ’s revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are
attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions or by merger, consolidation or
otherwise) of more than 15% of any class of equity securities of the Company
or any Company Subsidiaries or (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning more than 15% of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or of any resulting
parent company of the Company, other than the Transactions.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal
(substituting references to "15%" therein with "80%") that is obtained after
the date hereof but prior to the Offer Closing Date, with either no financing
contingency or fully committed financing (subject to customary conditions
thereto in commitment letters providing therefor) and that the Company Board
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (a) more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the Offer and the Merger, taking into account all relevant factors
(including all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the Offer and
this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of the Offer and
this Agreement proposed by Parent in accordance with _Section 6.5(f)_)) and
(b) reasonably capable of being completed in accordance with its terms, taking
into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects and terms of
such proposal and the third party.

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act
or making any disclosure to its stockholders required pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the SEC if the Company Board determines (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such actions
would be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary duties to the
CompanyÂ’s stockholders under 

 



55  applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the accurate
disclosure of factual information (and such disclosure shall not be deemed to
be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) regarding (x) the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company or (y) the fact
that a Company Takeover Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal to the extent, in
the case of each of clauses (x) and (y), (1) the Company in good faith
determines that such information, facts, identity and/or terms is required to
be disclosed under applicable Law and (2) any such disclosure includes the
Company Recommendation without disclosing or effecting a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.

(i) For purposes of this  _Section 6.5_, the term "Representatives" shall
mean directors, officers, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and
authorized agents.

 

Section 6.6 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in (at ParentÂ’s expense), review and comment on
all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in the defense or
settlement of any stockholder Litigation against the Company and its directors
relating to the any of the Transactions ("Stockholder Litigation"), which
comments the Company shall consider in good faith, and to consult with the
Company prior to the settlement of any Stockholder Litigation; _provided_ ,
that no such settlement that is greater in the aggregate than the amount set
forth in  _Section 6.6_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be agreed to
without ParentÂ’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except no settlement
(regardless of settlement amount) shall be effected unless Parent has
provided its prior written consent, which may be withheld in ParentÂ’s sole
discretion, if the settlement does not include a full release of the Company,
Parent, Guarantor and its Affiliates or if the settlement imposes an
injunction or other equitable relief upon the Company, Parent, Guarantor or
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation).

 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Director and Officer Insurance_. For not less
than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to, and
to cause the Surviving Corporation to, (x) indemnify and hold harmless all
past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company to the same
extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date hereof by the Company
pursuant to the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any
directors, officers or employees of the Company for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (y) advance expenses as
incurred to the extent provided for under such indemnification agreements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent agrees to, and to cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless such Persons to the fullest
extent permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of any of the Transactions.
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate
period of not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
CompanyÂ’s current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the
CompanyÂ’s existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage
is unavailable, the best available coverage;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for
the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to
the date hereof; _provided_ , that (a) Parent may substitute

 



56  therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to DandO Insurance at a
level at least as favorable as in the DandO Insurance, or (b) if Parent does not
make the substitution provided for in clause (a), then the Company may
substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to DandO
Insurance at a level at least as favorable as in the DandO Insurance for a
premium not to exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
hereof. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or any of their successors or
assigns, shall (i) be liquidated and dissolved, (ii) consolidate with or merge
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or (iii) sell or otherwise transfer all or a
majority of its assets to any other Person, proper provisions shall be made so
that the continuing or surviving entity or Parent, as applicable, and its
successors and assigns shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.7_. The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time,
shall thereafter not be terminated or amended in any manner so as to
adversely affect any indemnified party described in this _Section 6.7_, are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
indemnified party described in this _Section 6.7_ and his or her heirs and
Representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitute for, any other
rights that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The parties agree that the initial press
release(s) to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in the
form(s) agreed to by the parties. Except with respect to any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other
before making, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements (including broad-
based employee communications) with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such reasonably practicable consultation, except as
may be required by applicable Law, NASDAQ or court process, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

 

Section 6.9 _Employees_.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Offer Closing, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) provide the employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are employed immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") who remain employed during
such period by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits which, taken as a whole, have a
value substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation and
benefits provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof or (ii) provide or cause the Surviving Corporation (or, in such case,
its successors or assigns) to provide Covered Employees who remain employed
during such period by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits which, taken as a whole, have a
value substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , 
_however_ , in either case, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be required to provide any equity based compensation. Parent shall have no
obligation and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of
requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans
or to continue the employment of any specific Person.

 



57 (b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, and non-
forfeitable rights under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(including for purposes of vacation eligibility), but not for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, Covered Employees shall receive service credit for service
with the Company (and with any predecessor or acquired entities or any other
entities for which the Company granted service credit) as if such service had
been completed with Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 

(c) To the extent applicable, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any of their respective Subsidiaries to waive or use the
reasonable best efforts to cause its insurance carriers to waive any pre-
existing condition limitation on participation and coverage applicable to any
Covered Employee or any of his or her covered dependents under any health or
welfare plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (a " _New Plan_ ") in which such Covered Employee or
covered dependent shall become eligible to participate after the Effective
Time to the extent such Covered Employee or covered dependent was no longer
subject to such pre-existing condition limitation under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee or such covered dependent
was participating immediately before he or she became eligible to participate
in the New Plan. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the
relevant Subsidiary of either to provide each Covered Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time and during
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under any Company Benefit
Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment and deductible requirements for
such calendar year under any New Plan in which such Covered Employee
participates after the Effective Time.

(d) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) confer any rights or remedies of
any kind or description upon any Covered Employee or any other Person other
than the Company and Parent and their respective successors and assigns, (ii)
be construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of or limitation on the
ability to terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or
benefit plan or agreement of Parent (including any New Plan) or (iii) limit
the ability of the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered
Employee at any time.

(e) _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company will not, on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Offer Closing, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program,
agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or
pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any former, current
or future director, officer, employee, consultant, advisor or independent
contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any Person who would
have assumed such role or performed such duties but for a requirement to
refrain from assuming such role or performing such duties in such plan,
program, agreement or arrangement) unless, prior to such entry into,
establishment, amendment or modification, the compensation committee of the

 



58  Company Board (each member of which shall be an "independent director" in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps as may be
necessary to (i) approve as an employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement
and (ii) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program,
agreement or arrangement. The Company shall, prior to the Offer Closing, take
such actions necessary and appropriate to ratify, confirm and approve, in
accordance with and for the purpose of Rule 14d-10 under the Exchange Act,
compensation paid or payable to Covered Employees under any Company Benefit
Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or otherwise in connection with the
Transactions. 

Section 6.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.11 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company and the Company Board shall
take all actions necessary so that the restrictions of the Takeover Statutes
shall remain inapplicable to any and all of the Transactions. If any Takeover
Statute becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, the Company and
the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that any such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Statute on such
Transactions.

Section 6.12 _Termination of Credit Agreements_.

 

(a) Prior to or at the Offer Closing Date, the Company shall have delivered
executed payoff letters (the " _Debt Payoff Letters_ ") in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent for (i) the Second Amended and Restated Loan
and Security Agreement, dated as of November 27, 2013, which amends and

the Silicon Valley Loan Agreement and the 2012 Silicon Valley Loan Agreement,
the " _Credit Agreements_ ") and (iv) other outstanding indebtedness for
borrowed money, if any. Each Debt Payoff Letter shall (A) confirm the
full outstanding amount then outstanding, along with accrued interest thereon
and all fees and other obligations of the Company accrued under such Credit
Agreement (or such other indebtedness) (with respect to all of the Credit
Agreements, collectively, the " _Payoff Amounts_ "), (B) contain payment
instructions and (C) evidence the satisfaction, release and discharge of the
debt and liabilities under such Credit Agreement and the agreement by such 

 



59  lenders to release all Liens upon the payment of such amount in accordance
with the payment instructions. Prior to or at the Offer Closing Date, the
Company shall have obtained documents, including an authorization to file UCC
termination statements upon such payment, executed terminations and releases
of outstanding mortgages, as are reasonably necessary to release such Liens.

 

(b) At or prior to the Offer Closing Date, Parent shall either (i) repay the
Payoff Amounts to the lenders under the Credit Agreements and the Company
shall terminate the Credit Agreements or (ii) provide to the Company
sufficient funds to repay the Payoff Amounts to the lenders under the Credit
Agreements and the Company shall promptly use such funds to repay the
Payoff Amounts and terminate the Credit Agreements.

Section 6.13 _Deregistration; Stock Exchange Delisting_. After the Offer
Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and the rules

the provisions of  _Section 6.5_ (other than (x) any materially cured

Proposal (regardless of whether such Company Takeover Proposal is the same
Company Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (1)); _provided_ , that for
purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(i)(A)_, the term "Company Takeover Proposal"

defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements
or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes)

clauses within the same Section or, if more specific, subsection. References

Section 9.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This

agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this

enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

of any other party or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party by its duly authorized officer. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such right with
respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a
waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer or the Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger

added to the shares of Company Common Stock, if any, already owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, represents at least a
majority of the total number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on
a fully diluted basis (which means, as of any time, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding, together with all shares of Company Common
Stock that the Company would be required to issue pursuant to the conversion
or exercise of all options, warrants, rights and securities convertible into
or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or otherwise) on the
Expiration Date (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ "); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the consummation of the Offer or the Merger under the HSR Act
shall have expired or been terminated on the Expiration Date, and all other
Required Regulatory Authorizations shall have been obtained on the Expiration
Date (the " _Regulatory Condition_ "); 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | there shall not be existing any (A) temporary restraining
order or preliminary injunction or (B) pending Litigation by any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction that, in the case of clauses (A) and (B),
(I) challenges or seeks to enjoin or materially delay the Offer Closing or the
consummation of the other Transactions or (II) imposes or seeks to impose any
Adverse Regulatory Requirement as a condition to the expiration
or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or to obtaining any
Required Regulatory Authorizations necessary to satisfy the Regulatory
Condition; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | no applicable Law and no permanent injunction or other
judgment, order or decree entered, promulgated, enforced or issued by any
court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction in the United
States or any foreign jurisdiction shall be and remain in effect which (A)
has the effect of making illegal or otherwise prohibiting or materially
delaying the Offer Closing or the consummation of the other Transactions
(including the Tender Agreements) or (B) imposes or seeks to impose any
Adverse Regulatory Requirement as a condition to the expiration or termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act or to obtaining any Required

---|---|--- set forth in clause (i) of _Section 4.1(a)_, _Section 4.3_, _Section 4.20_
and _Section 4.25_ of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all
respects both as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Offer Closing Date

and as of such earlier date), (B) the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_, the first two sentences of  _Section

minimis_ respects, both as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Offer
Closing Date as though made on and as of the Offer Closing Date (except to
the extent such representations and warranties relate to an earlier date, in
which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in
all but _de minimis_ respects on and as of such earlier date), (C)
the representations and warranties of the Company in set forth in clause (b)
of _Section 4.10_ shall be true and correct in all respects, both as of the
date of the Agreement and at all times prior to the Offer Closing Date as
though made at and as of such time (except to the extent such representations
and warranties relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations
and warranties shall be true and correct in all respects on and as of such
earlier date) and (D) the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in the Agreement (other than those referred to in clauses (A), (B)
and (C)) (disregarding for purposes of this clause (D), any materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect qualifications contained in such
representations and warranties) shall be true and correct in all respects both
as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Offer Closing Date as though
made on and as of the Offer Closing Date (except to the extent
such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in
which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in
all respects on and as of such earlier date), except where the failure of any
such representations or warranties to be so true and correct would not have,
or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | the Company shall have performed in all material respects
all obligations, agreements and covenants required to be performed by it under
the Agreement (or any failure to perform as such shall have been cured) at
or prior to the Offer Closing Date;

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect; 
---|---|--- 



     | (viii) | the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate,
signed by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the
Company, to the effect that each of the conditions specified in subparagraphs

---|---|--- 
 



A-3 enforceable on the parties thereto; 
---|---|--- 



     | (x) | the Company shall not have entered into a definitive
agreement or agreement in principal with any Person with respect to a Company
Takeover Proposal; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (xi) | the Company Board shall not have made a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (xii) | the Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with its terms and the Offer shall not have been terminated in accordance with
the terms of the Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate and/or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub,
may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances
(including any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub, _provided_ , that
nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from any obligation or liability
such party has under the Agreement) giving rise to any such conditions and
may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time in their sole discretion (except for the Minimum Tender
Condition), in each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Any reference in this _Exhibit A_
or in the Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be
deemed to be satisfied if such condition or requirement is so waived. The
failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from
time to time. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this _Exhibit A_
shall have the meaning ascribed to them elsewhere in the Agreement to which
this _Exhibit A_ is attached.
