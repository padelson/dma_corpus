accordance with the specific procedures in effect for the Business as of the

calculations shall be based on GAAP as applied at September 30, 2018 (the
principles, practices, methodologies and policies set forth in clauses (i)
through (v), collectively, the " _Transaction Accounting Principles_ ").

 

(b) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to Purchaser a closing statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth a good-faith estimate of (i) the
Adjustment Amount (such estimate, the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_ "), (ii)
the Closing Cash Amounts (such estimate, the " _Estimated Closing Cash
Amounts_ "), and (iii) the Closing Funded Debt (such estimate, the "
_Estimated Closing Funded Debt_ "). The Closing Statement shall set forth the

this Agreement. Seller shall provide Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity
to review and to propose comments to the Closing Statement, which Seller shall
consider in good faith. The Estimated Adjustment Amount, the Estimated

amended as applicable to reflect Purchasers comments to the extent acceptable
by Seller in accordance with the preceding sentence) shall be used
to calculate the Closing Purchase Price to be paid by Purchaser to Seller at
the Closing. Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date
that the Post-Closing Statement becomes final and binding in accordance with
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, it will not take any actions with respect to any
accounting books, records, policies or procedures on which the Post-Closing
Statement is to be based, that are inconsistent with the ordinary course
past practice of the Business (or of Seller or any of its Affiliates with
respect to the Business) prior to the Closing or with the intent to impede or
delay the final determination of the Post-Closing Statement.

 



30

    

(c) As promptly as reasonably possible and in any event within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
and will provide to Seller, a written statement (the " _Post-Closing
Statement_ "), setting forth the Adjustment Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts
and the Closing Funded Debt. The Post-Closing Statement shall set forth in
reasonable detail Purchasers calculations of such amounts in the exact same
format as the Sample Closing Statement, and in a manner consistent with, the
definitions in this Agreement and the Transaction Accounting Principles (to
the extent applicable).

(d) Within forty-five (45) days following receipt by Seller of the Post-
Closing Statement, Seller shall deliver written notice to Purchaser of any
dispute Seller has with respect to the calculation, preparation or content of
the Post-Closing Statement (the " _Dispute Notice_ "); _provided_ , that if
Seller does not deliver any Dispute Notice to Purchaser within such forty-five
(45) day period, the Post-Closing Statement will be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties hereto. The Dispute Notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail (i) any item on the Post-Closing Statement that Seller
disputes and the grounds for such dispute and (ii) Sellers estimate of the
correct amount of such item; _provided_ , that (a) Seller may not dispute the
accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in
preparing the Post-Closing Statement unless they are inconsistent with the
Transaction Accounting Principles and (b) Seller shall be deemed to have
agreed with items and amounts on the Post-Closing Statement that are not
disputed in the Dispute Notice. Upon receipt by Purchaser of a Dispute Notice,
Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute set
forth therein. If Purchaser and Seller fail to resolve any such dispute
within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice (the " _Dispute
Resolution Period_ "), then, within ten (10) Business Days following the
expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period, an auditor mutually acceptable
to Seller and Purchaser (the " _Independent_ ___Accounting Firm_ ") shall be
engaged to resolve any such dispute; _provided_ , that, if such auditor is
unwilling or unable to perform the services required under this _Section_ __
_ 2.9(d)_ and Seller and Purchaser are unable to mutually agree on another
accounting firm to serve as the Independent Accounting Firm, then each of
Seller and Purchaser shall select a nationally recognized major accounting
firm, and the two (2) firms will mutually select a third nationally recognized
major accounting firm to serve as the Independent Accounting Firm. As promptly
as practicable, and in any event not more than fifteen (15) days following
the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Seller shall
each prepare and submit a written presentation detailing each partys complete
statement of proposed resolution of each issue still in dispute to the
Independent Accounting Firm (it being understood that the content of each such
presentation shall be limited to (x) whether the Adjustment Amount, the
Closing Cash Amounts and the Closing Funded Debt were properly calculated
in accordance with the definitions in this Agreement, (y) the proposed
resolution of each disputed issue by such party and (z) reasonable supporting
detail for the foregoing). Purchaser and Seller shall instruct the Independent
Accounting Firm to, as soon as practicable after the submission of the
presentations described in the immediately preceding sentence and in any event
not more than twenty (20) days following such presentations, make a final
determination, binding on the parties to this Agreement, of the appropriate
amount of each of the line items that remain in dispute as indicated in the
Dispute Notice. With respect to each disputed line item, such determination,
if not in accordance with the position of either Seller or Purchaser, shall
not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts
advocated by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, in their respective
presentations to the Independent Accounting Firm described above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the scope of the disputes to be resolved by
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to the disputed line items
submitted to the Independent

 



31

    

 Accounting Firm by Purchaser and Seller and whether any disputed
determinations of the Adjustment Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts and the
Closing Funded Debt were properly calculated in accordance with the
definitions in this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be allocated to be paid by Purchaser, on the one hand,
and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of
the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party, as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm. For
example, if Seller claims in a Dispute Notice that the Adjustment Amount is
$1,000 greater than the amount determined by Purchaser in the Closing
Statement, and if the Independent Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding Seller $600 of the $1,000 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e., 600
÷ 1,000) to Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 400 ÷ 1,000) to Seller. All
determinations made by the Independent Accounting Firm, and the Post-Closing
Statement, as modified by the Independent Accounting Firm, will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that
any adjustment as determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9(d)_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, except as otherwise
required by Law.

(e) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _
2.9_, each of Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with and
promptly make available to each other and their respective Representatives all
information, records, data and working papers (subject to customary
confidentiality agreements and access letters, as applicable), in each case
to the extent related to the Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Business,
Purchased Entities or Purchased Consolidated Ventures, and shall permit
reasonable access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably
required in connection with the preparation and analysis of the Post-Closing
Statement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder; _provided_ , that
Seller or Purchaser may withhold any document (or portions thereof) or
information that may constitute privileged attorney-client communications or
attorney work product, the transfer of which, or the provision of access to
which, on the advice of legal counsel, would reasonably be expected to risk a
waiver of such privilege or if the provision of access to such document (or
portion thereof) or information, on the advice of legal counsel, would
reasonably be expected to conflict with applicable Law (it being agreed, that,
in the event any of the restrictions in the foregoing apply, the disclosing
party shall provide the other party with a reasonably detailed description and
summary of the information not provided and cooperate in good faith with such
other party to design and implement alternative disclosure arrangements to
enable such other party and its Representatives to evaluate any such
information without resulting in such violation or jeopardizing such attorney-
client privilege or contravening such Laws).

 

(f) The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Base Purchase Price, _plus_
(i) the Closing Cash Amounts, _plus_  (ii) the Adjustment Amount (which may
be a positive or negative number), _minus_ (iii) the Closing Funded Debt, in
each case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), as finally determined pursuant to
_Sections_ __ _ 2.9(c)_ and _2.9(d)_.

(g) If the Closing Purchase Price shall exceed the Final Purchase Price, then
Seller shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess
to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Purchaser to Seller; or if the Final
Purchase Price shall exceed the Closing Purchase Price, then Purchaser shall
pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess to Seller by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser. Any such payment is to be
made within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Adjustment
Amount, Closing Cash Amounts and Closing Funded Debt are finally determined
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_.

Section 2.10. _Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller and Purchaser agree to
allocate and, as applicable, to cause their relevant Affiliates to allocate,
the Final Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as additional
consideration for Tax purposes among the Purchased Assets (including among the
Purchased Entity Shares and the Purchased Venture Interests) in accordance
with _Exhibit D_ attached hereto (the " _Allocation Schedule"_ ). No later
than sixty (60) days after the date on which the Final Purchase Price is
finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser proposed allocations (including allocations with respect to the
assets of any Purchased Entities that are deemed acquired for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes) of the Final Purchase Price (as finally determined
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_) and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for Tax purposes to Seller as of the Closing Date, in
each case determined in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule,
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
(the " _Seller s Allocations"_). If Purchaser disagrees with any of Sellers
Allocations, Purchaser may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of
Sellers Allocations, deliver a notice (the " _Purchaser s Allocation
Notice"_) to Seller to such effect, specifying those items as to which
Purchaser disagrees and setting forth Purchasers proposed allocations. If
Purchasers Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Seller and Purchaser shall,
during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine the allocations of the Final Purchase Price (as finally
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_) and any other items that are
treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes. If Seller and Purchaser
are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the
Independent Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Allocation Schedule shall not be subject to
revision following the Closing, and any allocation of the Final Purchase
Price (as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.9_) and any other
items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes (as agreed
by Purchaser and Seller or determined pursuant to the decision of the
Independent Accounting Firm) shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with
the Allocation Schedule. The allocations, as prepared by Seller if no
Purchasers Allocation Notice has been given, as adjusted pursuant to any
agreement between Seller and Purchaser or as determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm (the " _Allocations"_ ), shall be conclusive and binding on
the parties hereto. None of Seller or Purchaser shall (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates not to) take any position inconsistent with the
Allocations on any Tax Return or in any Tax Proceeding, in each case, except
to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision of state,
local or foreign law).

Section 2.11.  _Non-Assignment; Consents_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer or
convey any Purchased Asset (or any Assumed Liabilities thereunder) if an
attempted sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance thereof would be prohibited
by Law or would, without the approval, authorization or consent of, filing
with, notification to, or granting or issuance of any license, order, waiver
or permit by, any third party or Governmental Entity (collectively, "
_Approvals_ "), (i) constitute a breach thereof or contravention of any
Contract thereof, (ii) be ineffective, void or voidable, or (iii) adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Seller Entities, Purchaser, or any of
their respective officers, directors, agents or Affiliates, unless and until
such Approval is obtained.

 



33

    

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
or cause to be obtained, any Approval (other than Regulatory Approvals, which
shall be governed by _Section_ __ _ 5.1_) required to sell, assign or
transfer any Purchased Asset and to obtain the unconditional release of Seller
and its Affiliates so that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely
responsible for the Assumed Liabilities from and after the Closing. If such
Approval is not obtained prior to Closing, until the earlier of such time as
such Approval is obtained or 18 months following the Closing Date, then
Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser to
establish an agency type or any other similar arrangement reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser and Seller intended to both (x) provide Purchaser, to
the fullest extent practicable, the claims, rights and benefits of any such
Purchased Assets, and (y) cause Purchaser to bear all costs and Liabilities
(in each case, that are Assumed Liabilities) thereunder from and after
the Closing in accordance with this Agreement (including by means of any
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement). In furtherance of the
foregoing, Purchaser will promptly pay, perform or discharge when due any
Assumed Liability (including any Assumed Liability with respect to Taxes,
determined on a "with-and-without" basis) arising thereunder after the Closing
Date and Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, without further
consideration therefor, promptly pay and remit to Purchaser all monies, rights
and other consideration received thereunder (including any Tax Benefit
actually realized, determined on a "with-and-without" basis). Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to pay compensation to any third party, commence
or participate in any Action or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise, including any accommodation or arrangement to remain secondarily
liable or contingently liable for any Assumed Liability) to any third party
(x) to obtain any such third party consent or (y) in connection with Sellers
and its Affiliates obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 2.11(b)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, (a) no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller
contained in the Transaction Documents shall be breached or deemed breached,
and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied, based solely on the failure to
obtain any such Approvals and (b) no covenant of Seller contained in the
Transaction Documents shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition
shall be deemed not satisfied, based solely on any Action commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such Approvals.

(c) Any Contract to be assigned, transferred and conveyed in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_ that does not exclusively relate to the Business (each, a
" _Shared Contract_ ") shall be assigned, transferred and conveyed only with
respect to (and preserving the meaning of) those parts that relate to the
Business, to either a Purchased Subsidiary or Purchaser, as so directed by
Purchaser, if so assignable, transferrable or conveyable, or appropriately
amended prior to, on or after the Closing, so that (A) Purchaser shall
be entitled to the rights and benefits of those parts of the Shared Contract
that relate to the Business and shall assume only the related portion of any
Assumed Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement and (B) a Seller Entity
shall be entitled to the rights and benefit of those parts of the Shared
Contract that do not relate to the Business and shall retain only the related
portion of any Retained Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
, that (i) in no event shall any Person be required to assign (or amend),
either in its entirety or in part, any Shared Contract that is not assignable
(or cannot be amended) by its terms without obtaining one or more Approvals
and (ii) if any Shared Contract cannot be so partially assigned

 



34

    

 by its terms, or cannot be amended, without such Approval or Approvals,
until the earlier of such time as such Approval or Approvals are obtained and
one (1) year following the Closing Date, then Seller and Purchaser will
cooperate to establish an agency type or other similar arrangement reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser intended to (w) provide Purchaser, to the
fullest extent practicable under such Shared Contract, the claims, rights and
benefits of the parts that relate to the Business from and after the Closing,
(x) cause Purchaser to promptly pay, perform or discharge when due all Assumed
Liabilities thereunder from and after the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement, (y) provide Seller, to the fullest extent practicable under such
Shared Contract, the claims, rights and benefits of those parts that do not
relate to the Business from and after the Closing and (z) cause Seller
to promptly pay, perform or discharge when due all Retained Liabilities
thereunder from and after the Closing in accordance with this Agreement
(including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing
arrangement). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay compensation
to any third party, commence or participate in any Action or offer or grant
any accommodation (financial or otherwise, including any accommodation or
arrangement to remain secondarily liable or contingently liable for any
Assumed Liability) to any third party in connection with Sellers and its
Affiliates obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.11(c)_.

(d) For so long as the Seller Entities hold any Purchased Assets or are
parties to any Shared Contracts after the Closing and provide Purchaser any
claims, rights and benefits of any such Purchased Asset or Shared Contract (in
the case of such Shared Contract, to the extent related to the Business)
pursuant to an arrangement described in  _Section_ __ _ 2.11(b)_ or _(c)_ ,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller, such Seller Entities and their
respective Affiliates harmless from and against all Covered Losses incurred or
asserted as a result of Sellers or any such Affiliates or their respective
Affiliates post-Closing direct or indirect ownership, management or operation
of any such Purchased Assets or Shared Contracts (in each case, in accordance
with this Agreement and only if such Covered Losses relate to or arise out of
the Purchased Assets or to the extent that such Covered Losses relate to or
arise out of the Business ), except to the extent resulting from Sellers or
any of its Affiliates gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any transfer or
assignment to Purchaser of any Purchased Asset or any part of a Shared
Contract that shall require an Approval as described above in this  _Section_
__ _ 2.11_ shall be made subject to such Approval being obtained; _
provided_, that upon receipt of such Approval, such transfer and assignment
shall automatically and without further action be effected in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.12. _Foreign Acquisition Agreements_. The transfer of each
Purchased Asset, Assumed Liability or Purchased Company organized in a
jurisdiction in which local Laws require observance of specified formalities
or procedures to legally effect a transfer of such entity will be effected
pursuant to short-form acquisition agreements (the " _Foreign Acquisition
Agreements_ _"_ ) on a country-by-country basis. Each Foreign Acquisition
Agreement for the transfer of Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities
shall be in substantially the same form as the form of the Foreign Acquisition
Agreement attached as _Exhibit E_ hereto, and each Foreign Acquisition
Agreement for the transfer of a Purchased Company shall be in substantially
the same form as the form of the Foreign Acquisition Agreement attached as
_Exhibit F_ hereto, except as Seller and Purchaser may otherwise agree,
including for: (i) the deletion of provisions which are inapplicable to such
Purchased Company, Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability; (ii) such changes as
may be necessary to satisfy the requirements of applicable local Law; and
(iii) such changes as may be

 



35

    

 reasonably agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser regarding employees and
employee benefit matters in order to adapt such agreement to the particular
circumstances of the relevant Purchased Company and country; _provided_ , in
each case, that the Foreign Acquisition Agreements shall serve purely to
effect the legal transfer of the applicable Purchased Company, Purchased Asset
or Assumed Liability and shall not have any effect on the value being
received by Purchaser or given by the Seller Entities, including the
allocation of assets and Liabilities as between them, all of which shall be
determined by this Agreement.

 

Section 2.13. _Withholding_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of applicable Law. Before making any deduction or
withholding pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.13_, Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with such Person to reduce
or eliminate (including by obtaining a refund of) any amounts that would
otherwise be deductible or withheld, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law. Amounts withheld and paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.14. _Seller Withholding_. Seller shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, deduct and withhold, and pay to the applicable Taxing
Authorities in Germany any amounts required to be deducted and withheld in
respect of the Pre-Closing Reorganization under applicable German Tax Law.
Seller shall provide, within five (5) Business Days after such deduction and
withholding, evidence thereof reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. If
evidence of such deduction and withholding is not provided by Seller to
Purchaser at or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall make such deduction and
withholding and reduce the amount otherwise payable to Seller upon the Closing
by the amount with respect to which Seller failed to deduct and withhold.
Purchaser shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a refund of
any amounts withheld pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.14_ on or prior to
the one (1)-year anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) cooperate with
Seller in good faith in obtaining such refund, including by keeping
Seller reasonably informed of the progress of any refund claim, consulting
with Seller as to appropriate steps to obtain such refund and offering Seller,
at Sellers sole cost and expense, an opportunity to comment before submitting
any written materials and to participate in any live or telephonic
discussions with a German Taxing Authority in respect of such refund. Any such
refund (including any amounts received following such one (1)-year
anniversary) shall be paid to Seller pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Seller provides evidence
or analysis reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that no deduction or
withholding is required under applicable German Tax Law, Purchaser and Seller
agree that Seller shall have satisfied its obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 2.14_, and Purchaser shall not be entitled under this _Section_ __ _ 2.14_
to reduce the amount otherwise payable to Seller upon the Closing.

transfers, or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a Proceeding in equity or at law) (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

Section 3.4. _No Conflicts; Consents_. The execution and delivery by each
Seller Entity of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which
it is a party does not and will not, and the consummation of the Transaction
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including
the Pre-Closing Reorganization) and compliance by such Seller Entity with the
terms hereof and thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation

(including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto, and the executed fee
letter associated therewith redacted in a manner as described below,
collectively, and as the same may be amended, replaced, waived or otherwise
modified from time to time to the extent not prohibited by _Section_ __ _
5.16(d)_, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the Debt
Financing Sources have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, to provide the aggregate amounts set forth therein (the "
_Debt Financing_ ") for the purposes of funding the Financing Uses and (b)
the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, among Purchaser,
the Guarantor and the other parties thereto (including all exhibits, schedules
and annexes thereto, the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " and, together with
the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ "), pursuant to which
the Guarantor has committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to invest cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the "
_Equity Financing_ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_
"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides that Seller is a third-
party beneficiary thereto to the extent set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter. None of the Commitment Letters have been amended, supplemented or
modified prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date hereof no such
amendment, supplement or modification is contemplated or pending, and as of
the date of this Agreement, the respective commitments contained in the
Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect and no such withdrawal, termination or rescission is contemplated
except, in each case, in connection with the potential addition of lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities as parties
thereto in a manner permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 5.16_. Except for (i) the
fee letter referred to above (a complete copy of which has been provided to
Seller, with only fee amounts and the economic terms (other than covenants)
related to the "market flex" provisions contained therein redacted) (provided
that Purchaser represents and warrants that the market flex provisions in such
fee letter do not permit the imposition of any new conditions (or the
modification or expansion of any existing conditions) with respect to the
Debt Financing or any reduction in the amount of the Debt Financing), (ii)
customary engagement letters and fee credit letters and (iii) customary non-
disclosure agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (none of which
adversely affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability, termination or
availability of the Debt Financing), there are no side letters or Contracts to
which Purchaser is a party related to the provision, funding or investing, as
applicable, of the Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby other
than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters delivered to Seller
prior to the date hereof. Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other fees in connection with the Commitment Letters that are payable
on or prior to the date hereof and Purchaser will, directly or indirectly,
continue to pay in full any such amounts required to be paid as and when they
become due and payable on or prior to the Closing Date. As of the date hereof,
the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid,
binding and enforceable obligations of Purchaser and, to the Knowledge
of Purchaser, each of the other parties thereto, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions, and Purchaser is not aware of any fact or
occurrence existing on the date hereof that would or would reasonably be
expected to make any of the assumptions or any of the statements

 



60

    

 set forth in the Commitment Letters inaccurate or that would or would
reasonably be expected to cause the Commitment Letters to be ineffective.
There are no conditions or other contingencies related to the provision,
funding or investing of the full amount of the Financing (including pursuant
to any market flex provisions in the fee letter or otherwise), other than as
expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters delivered to Seller prior to
the date hereof (or, in the case of any Alternative Financing Commitment
Letter, at the time provided for in _Section_ __ _ 5.16_). As of the date
hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would or would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a default or
breach on the part of Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other
party thereto under any of the Commitment Letters, (ii) constitute a failure
to satisfy a condition on the part of Purchaser or, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, any other party thereto under the Commitment Letters or (iii) to
the Knowledge of Purchaser, result in any portion of the amounts to be
provided, funded or invested in accordance with the Commitment Letters being
unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, Purchaser has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letters will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the
Financing will not be made available to Purchaser in full on the Closing Date,
and, as of the date hereof, Purchaser is not aware of the existence of any
fact or event that would or would reasonably be expected to cause such
conditions to the Financing not to be satisfied or the full amount of the
Financing not to be made available to Purchaser in full on the Closing Date.
Assuming the Financing is funded and/or invested in accordance with the
Commitment Letters, Purchaser will have on the Closing Date funds sufficient
to (i) pay the aggregate Closing Purchase Price, (ii) pay any and all fees and
expenses required to be paid by Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Financing, and (iii) satisfy all of
the other payment obligations of Purchaser contemplated hereunder (clauses (i)
through (iii), the " _Financing Uses_ "). Purchaser affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement
that Purchaser obtain the Financing or any other financing for or related to
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.5. _Guaranties_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
each Guarantor has delivered to Seller a duly executed Guaranty. As of the
date hereof and as of immediately prior to the Closing, the Guaranty is valid,
binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms, and is in full force and
effect, subject in each case to the effect of any applicable Enforceability
Exceptions. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part
of any Guarantor under the terms and conditions of the Guaranty.

Section 4.6. _Proceedings_. There are no, and in the past three (3) years
there have been no, Actions or Judgments pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened, against Purchaser or any of its Affiliates that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.7. _Brokers_. Other than Persons whose fees and expenses will be
paid by Purchaser, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other
similar fee or commission in connection with the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Purchaser.

 



61

    

Section 4.8. _Investigation; Acquisition of Shares for Investment_. Purchaser
has knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, and is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser confirms that Seller
has made available to Purchaser and its Affiliates and Representatives the
opportunity to ask questions of the officers and management of Seller and the
Business, as well as access to the documents, information and records of or
with respect to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Business
and the Purchased Companies and to acquire additional information about the
business and financial condition of the Business, and Purchaser confirms that
it has made an independent investigation, analysis and evaluation of the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Business and the Purchased
Companies. Purchaser is acquiring the Purchased Entity Shares and the
Purchased Venture Interests for investment purposes and not with a view toward
or for offer or sale in connection with any distribution thereof, or with any
present intention of offering, distributing or selling any of the Purchased
Entity Shares or the Purchased Venture Interests. Purchaser acknowledges that
the Purchased Entity Shares and the Purchased Venture Interests have not been
registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act"_ ), or any
state securities Laws, and agrees that the Purchased Entity Shares and the
Purchased Venture Interests may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale,
pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration
available, or in a transaction not subject to registration, under the
Securities Act and without compliance with foreign securities Laws, in each
case, to the extent applicable. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" within
the meaning of Rule 501 under the Securities Act, and any Purchased Entity
Shares or Purchased Venture Interests that Purchaser receives hereunder will
be received only on its own behalf and its Affiliate assignees and not for the
account or benefit of any other person or entity. Purchaser is able to bear
the economic risk of holding the Purchased Entity Shares and the Purchased
Venture Interests for an indefinite period (including, without limitation,
total loss of its investment). 

Section 4.9. _Solvency_. On the Closing Date, immediately after giving effect
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the payment of the Closing Purchase Price, the _Financing_ and
payment of all related fees and expenses) and assuming (i) that any estimates,
projections or forecasts provided by or on behalf of Seller to Purchaser
prior to the date hereof were prepared in good faith based on reasonable
assumptions, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to Purchasers
obligations to effect the Closing, and (iii) the accuracy in all
material respects of the representations and warranties contained in
_Article_ __ _ III_ (which representations and warranties shall, for this
purpose, be assumed to be true and correct without giving effect to any
knowledge, materiality, "Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers
contained therein), Purchaser will be Solvent immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing
Date. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Solvent_ " means that, with respect
to any Person, as of any date of determination, (a) the "fair saleable value"
of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of
all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities,"
as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance
with applicable Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors,
and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of
such Person, as of such date, on its existing debts (including contingent and
other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such Person
will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date and (c) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature.

 



62

    

Section 4.10. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Seller acknowledges
that (a) none of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates has made any
representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates, their financial condition, results of operations, future
operating or financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or
prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
furnished or made available to Seller and its Affiliates and Representatives,
except as expressly set forth in this _Article_ __ _ IV_ or in any
certificate delivered hereunder or any other Transaction Document, and (b)
Seller has not relied on any representation or warranty from Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates in determining to enter into this Agreement, except as
expressly set forth in this _Article_ __ _ IV_ or in any certificate
delivered hereunder or any other Transaction Document.

ARTICLE V

 

 _COVENANTS_

 

Section 5.1. _Efforts_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c)_,
Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to)
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any
applicable Law to consummate and make effective in the most expeditious
manner possible the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms,
registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the Transaction
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable, (ii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Transaction and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, and (iii) during the pendency of this Agreement, the defending of
any lawsuits or other legal proceedings brought by any Governmental Entity,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or
reversed. Without limiting the foregoing, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c)_,
Purchaser and Seller shall (and, Purchaser shall cause its "ultimate parent
entity," as such term is generally determined in accordance with
applicable Antitrust Laws, to) use reasonable best efforts to take all
actions reasonably necessary to obtain (and shall reasonably cooperate with
each other in obtaining) any Regulatory Approvals (which actions shall include
furnishing all information reasonably required in connection with such
Approvals) required to be obtained or made by Purchaser, Seller, the other
Seller Entities or the Purchased Subsidiaries in connection with the
Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Additionally, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c)_, each of Purchaser and Seller
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to fulfill all conditions
precedent to this Agreement (including those set forth in Section 7.1) and
Purchaser shall not take any action after the date of this Agreement that
would reasonably be expected to impair or materially delay the obtaining of,
or result in not obtaining, any Regulatory Approval (excluding any
such Regulatory Approval

 



63

    

 required in connection with the Pre-Closing Reorganization, but solely to
the extent resulting from any changes to the Pre-Closing Reorganization made
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ after the date hereof) necessary to
be obtained prior to the Closing. To the extent that transfers of any Permits
are required as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such
transfers.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, subject to applicable Law, Purchaser and Seller
shall each use reasonable best efforts to keep the other reasonably apprised
of the status of matters relating to the completion of the Transaction and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required Regulatory Approvals. In that regard,
prior to the Closing, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section_
__ _ 5.3_ of this Agreement and applicable Law, each party shall promptly
consult with the other party to this Agreement to provide any reasonably
necessary information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence,
provide the other party (or their counsel) copies of) all filings made by such
party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such
party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement, the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section_ __ _
5.3_ of this Agreement and applicable Law, each party shall promptly inform
the other party, and if in writing, furnish the other party with copies of
(or, in the case of material oral communications, advise the other party
orally of) any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed
written (or any material proposed oral) communication with any such
Governmental Entity. If either party or any Representative of such party
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transaction or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will use its reasonable best
efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the
other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Neither
party will participate, or permit its Representatives to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or make
substantive oral submissions at meetings or in telephone or other
conversations) unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives such other party a
reasonable opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and applicable Law, each
party shall furnish the other party with copies of all filings, written
submissions, correspondence, and material communications (and any memoranda
prepared by such party setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any
such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Transaction or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and furnish the other
party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of filings or
submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity. Purchaser and
Seller may, as each deems reasonably advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be) or
its legal

 



64

    

 counsel; _provided_ , that materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 5.1(b)_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation
of or future plans for the Business or Purchasers or Sellers business, (ii)
as necessary to comply with contractual obligations, and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege concerns.

 

(c) Purchaser agrees to take promptly any and all steps and actions necessary
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur expeditiously and provided that
such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Closing, but in no
case later than the Outside Date, including, as applicable, (i) providing
information to such Persons and (ii) proposing, negotiating, committing to or
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale,
divesture or disposition of, or holding separate (through the establishment
of a trust or otherwise), such of the Purchased Assets and of the assets,
properties and businesses of Purchaser, the Business and the Purchased
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, (B) the termination, modification or
extension of existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations of
Purchaser, the Business and the Purchased Subsidiaries after the Closing Date,
(C) the establishment or creation of relationships and contractual rights and
obligations of Purchaser, the Business and the Purchased Subsidiaries after
the Closing Date, (D) the termination of any relevant venture or other
arrangement of Purchaser, the Business and the Purchased Subsidiaries after
the Closing Date, and (E) any other change or restructuring of the Purchased
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, in each case, as may be required to be
taken in order to obtain any Regulatory Approval (excluding any
such Regulatory Approval required in connection with the Pre-Closing
Reorganization, but solely to the extent resulting from any changes to the
Pre-Closing Reorganization made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.13_
after the date hereof) or avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other
order in any litigation, which would otherwise have the effect of materially
delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under Antitrust Laws (each such action described in this clause
(ii), a " _Divestiture Action_ "); provided that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
shall be required to (and Seller and its Affiliates shall not without
Purchasers prior written consent), propose, negotiate, commit to or effect,
by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any Divestiture Action
with respect to the assets or businesses of Purchaser and its Affiliates other
than the Business, the Purchased Assets and the Purchased Entities following
the Closing (each such Divestiture Action that Purchaser is not required to
accept or take, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). In addition, Purchaser shall
oppose, through and including litigation on the merits (and any appeals with
respect thereto), any claim asserted in court or other forum by any
Governmental Entity in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would restrain or prevent the Closing by the Outside Date.

(d) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use reasonable best efforts to provide such security and assurances as to
financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably
requested by any Governmental Entity or other third party whose Approval is
sought in connection with the Transaction and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Whether or not the Transaction is consummated,
Purchaser shall be responsible for all filing fees and payments to any
Governmental Entity in order to obtain any Approvals (excluding any Approvals
required in connection with the Pre-Closing Reorganization) pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_, other than the fees of and payments to Sellers legal
and professional advisors.

 



65

    

(e) Purchaser shall have the right to direct all matters with any Governmental
Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder, and Purchaser shall make
all strategic decisions and lead all discussions, negotiations and other
proceedings, and coordinate all activities with respect to any requests that
may be made by, or any Approvals that may be sought by or from, any
Governmental Entity, including determining the strategy for contesting,
litigating or otherwise responding to objections to, or proceedings
challenging, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in each case subject to good faith consultations with Seller
reasonably in advance and in consideration of Sellers views. Any provision in
this Agreement notwithstanding, none of Seller, the other Seller Entities or
any of their respective Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the
Purchased Companies) shall under any circumstance be required to pay or commit
to pay any amount or incur any obligation in favor of or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise, regardless of any provision to the
contrary in the underlying Contract, including any requirements for the
securing or posting of any bonds, letters of credit or similar instruments, or
the furnishing of any guarantees) to any Person to obtain any Approval. None
of Seller, the other Seller Entities nor any of their respective Affiliates
(including, prior to the Closing, the Purchased Companies) shall have any
Liability whatsoever to Purchaser solely arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any Approvals that may be required in connection with the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
because of the termination of any Contract as a result thereof. Purchaser
acknowledges that (i) no representation, warranty or covenant of Seller
contained in the Transaction Documents shall be breached or deemed breached,
and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied, based solely on (A) the
failure to obtain any Approval or (B) any such termination of a Contract and
(ii) no covenant of Seller contained in the Transaction Documents shall be
breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied,
based solely on any Proceeding commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any
Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such Approval
or any such termination.

 

(f) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, Purchaser will not take
any action the effect of which would reasonably be expected to materially
delay or materially impede the ability of the parties to consummate the
Transaction (excluding for this purpose the Pre-Closing Reorganization, but
solely to the extent resulting from any changes to the Pre-Closing
Reorganization made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ after the date
hereof). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser will not,
and will not permit any respective Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire
(by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of
the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner), any Person or portion
thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering
into a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such
acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the
risk of not obtaining, any permits, orders or other approvals of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the Transaction or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) materially increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the Transaction, or (iii) materially delay the consummation of
the Transaction, in each case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) excluding for
this purpose the Pre-Closing Reorganization, but solely to the extent
resulting from any changes to the Pre-Closing Reorganization made in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ after the date hereof.

survive the Closing in accordance with such terms; _provided_ , that actions

the Assumed Liabilities or the Purchased Companies, except to the extent that
such information (i) was previously known on a non-confidential basis by
Seller, (ii) is in the public domain through no fault of Seller or its
Affiliates or (iii) was later lawfully acquired by Seller from sources other
than those related to its prior ownership of the Business. The obligation of
Seller and its Affiliates to hold any such information in confidence shall be
satisfied if they exercise the same care with respect to such information as
they would take to preserve the confidentiality of their own similar
information.

 

Section 5.4. _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Seller shall afford to Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives reasonable access in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the operation of the Business, upon reasonable notice during

personnel of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries related to the Business, the

Property, or any other property of Seller, the other Seller Entities, the
Purchased Entities or any of their respective Affiliates.

(b) Purchaser agrees that any investigation undertaken pursuant to the access
granted under _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_ shall be conducted in such a manner as
not to unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Business, and none of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall communicate with
any of the employees of the Business without the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to provide access to or
disclose information where, upon the advice of counsel, such access or

 



72

    

 disclosure would jeopardize attorney-client privilege or contravene any Laws
(it being agreed that, in the event the restrictions in the foregoing sentence
apply, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a reasonably detailed description
and summary of the information not provided and cooperate with Purchaser to
design and implement alternative disclosure arrangements to enable Purchaser
and its Representatives to evaluate any such information so long as such
disclosure will not jeopardize such attorney-client privilege or contravening
such Laws).

(c) At and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, afford Seller, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives, during
normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Business, consistent with
applicable Law and in accordance with the reasonable procedures established by
Purchaser, access to the information, properties, books, Contracts, records
and employees of the Business and the Purchased Entities to the extent that
such access may be reasonably requested by Seller for a reasonable business
purpose, including in connection with the preparation of financial statements,
Taxes, reporting obligations and compliance with applicable Laws; _provided_
, that nothing in this Agreement shall limit any of Sellers or any of its
Affiliates rights of discovery; _provided_ , further, that (i) neither
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to violate any
obligation of confidentiality to which it or any of its Affiliates is subject
in discharging their obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(c)_ (it
being agreed that, in the event the restriction in the foregoing clause (i)
applies, Purchaser shall provide Seller with a reasonably detailed
description and summary of the information not provided and cooperate with
Seller to design and implement alternative disclosure arrangements to enable
Seller to evaluate any such information without resulting in such violation).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to provide access to or disclose
information where, upon the advice of counsel, such access or disclosure
would jeopardize attorney-client privilege or contravene any Laws (it being
agreed that, in the event the restrictions in the foregoing sentence apply,
Purchaser shall provide Seller with a reasonably detailed description
and summary of the information not provided and cooperate with Seller to
design and implement alternative disclosure arrangements to enable Seller and
its Representatives to evaluate any such information so long as such
disclosure will not jeopardize such attorney-client privilege or contravening
such Laws).

(d) At and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, afford Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives,
during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, and in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the operation of Sellers business,
consistent with applicable Law and in accordance with the reasonable
procedures established by Seller, reasonable access to the information,
properties, books, Contracts, records and personnel of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries related to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the Purchased Companies to the extent that such access may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser for a reasonable business purpose, including
in connection with the preparation of financial statements, Taxes, reporting
obligations and compliance with applicable Laws.

(f) Seller agrees to hold all the books and records of the Business existing
on the Closing Date that it has retained as of the Closing Date and not to
destroy or dispose of any thereof for a period of seven (7) years from the
Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by Law.

 

(g) From and after the Closing, upon Purchasers request, Seller agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce, at Sellers sole cost and
expense, any confidentiality and non-use provisions relating to confidential
information regarding the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or the Purchased Companies in any non-disclosure, confidentiality
or similar Contracts between Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any potential acquiror of all or a majority of the Business, on the
other hand, entered into in the past three (3) years.

(h) From and after the execution of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, except as may be required by Law (including Antitrust

cause its Representatives to, cooperate in planning the integration after the
Closing of the Business, on the one hand, with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, including by providing information as reasonably requested
by Purchaser in connection with planning for the provision and receipt of the
Services, including information on the calculation of the Fees (as defined in
the Transition Services Agreement) set forth on the Schedules (as defined in
the Transition Services Agreement) of Services (as defined in the Transition
Services Agreement) provided by Seller as attached to the Transition Services
Agreement as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(h)_, the parties may designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section_ __
_ 5.4(h)_ as "outside counsel only". Such competitively sensitive materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside legal
counsel and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Purchaser or Seller, as the case
may be) or its legal counsel; _provided_ , that materials provided pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(h)_ may be redacted (i) to remove
references concerning the valuation of or future plans for the Business or
Purchasers or Sellers business, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
obligations, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

 

Section 5.5. _Publicity_. Each of Seller and Purchaser may issue an initial

Affiliate or Representative of such party shall issue or cause the publication
of any press release or public announcement in respect of this Agreement, the
Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other party hereto (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required
by Law or stock exchange rules; _provided_ , that Purchaser may provide

Section 5.6. _Intercompany Accounts and Intercompany Arrangements_.
Immediately prior to the Closing, all intercompany balances and accounts
(other than accounts set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules) between Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Purchased Companies), on the one hand, and the Purchased Companies, on the
other hand, shall be settled or otherwise eliminated in such a manner as the
Seller Entities shall determine in their sole discretion (including by the
Seller Entities or any of their Affiliates removing from any Purchased
Company all Cash Amounts or funds from cash pools by means of dividends,
distributions, contribution, the creation or repayment of intercompany debt,
increasing or decreasing of cash pool balances or otherwise) without any
further Liability to any Purchased Company. Intercompany balances and accounts
solely among any of the Purchased Companies shall not be affected by this
provision. Immediately prior to the Closing, except for the Transaction
Documents to be entered into in connection with this Agreement or as set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, all Related
Party Agreements shall automatically be terminated without further payment or
performance and cease to have any further force and effect, such that no
party thereto shall have any further Liabilities therefor or thereunder.

 

Section 5.7. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Continuation of Employment_.

 

(i) At or prior to Closing, Seller shall (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
use reasonable best efforts to transfer the employment of each Business
Employee who is not employed by a Purchased Company to a Purchased Company as
designated by Seller for the positions described in Section 5.2(b)(i) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules and, with respect to positions other than
those described in Section 5.2(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, as
designated by Seller in good faith consultation with Purchaser.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any Business Employee cannot
practicably be transferred to a Purchased Company, Purchaser shall extend an
offer of employment to such employee on terms consistent with this Agreement
and following such Business Employees acceptance of such offer of employment,
such employee will be a Business Employee for purposes of this Agreement.
Subject to applicable Law, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in
good faith for the purpose of preparing for on-boarding Business Employees.

 

(ii) As of the Closing Date (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not for any
minimum period of time thereafter), Purchaser shall (i) cause each of the
Purchased Companies to continue to employ on the Closing Date its respective
Purchased Company Employees, and (ii) with respect to each other Business
Employee, either (A) continue to employ such other Business Employee, to
the extent employment continues by operation of Law, or (B) offer, or cause
its applicable Affiliate to offer, employment to such other Business Employee,
to the extent employment does not continue by operation of Law, in all cases,
on terms consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_. Each Purchased Company
Employee, each other Business Employee whose employment continues by operation
of Law or who commences employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
within six (6) months following the Closing, each Business Employee who
accepts Purchasers offer of employment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.7(a)_, and each Business Employee who accepts an offer of employment from
Purchaser in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.7(f)_, shall be referred to
herein as a " _Transferred Business Employee_." Except as otherwise expressly
set forth herein, from and after the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates
shall retain all Liabilities (i) under Seller Benefit Plans (other than
Liabilities with respect to Transferred Business Employees pursuant to the
Assumed Benefit Plans) or (ii) under the Post-Retirement Plans that are
transferred to the Mirror Plans, and Purchaser and its Affiliates shall
assume or retain, as applicable, all Liabilities under Purchased Company
Benefit Plans with respect to Post-Retirement Plans transferred to the Mirror
Plans and with respect to Transferred Business Employees pursuant to the
Assumed Benefit Plans.

 



75

    

(b) _Terms and Conditions of Employment_. With respect to each Transferred
Business Employee who is not covered by a collective bargaining or other
labor Contract, Purchaser shall maintain, for a period of at least twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date, (A) the same wage rate or base salary level
in effect for such Transferred Business Employee immediately prior to the
Closing and (B) annual cash incentive compensation opportunities and employee
benefits (other than equity-based and other long-term incentive compensation
opportunities) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those
in effect for such Transferred Business Employees immediately prior to the
Closing. The compensation and benefits of Transferred Business Employees who
are covered by a collective bargaining or other labor Contract shall be
provided as required in accordance with the applicable Contract. As of and
after the Closing, Purchaser shall provide to each Transferred Business
Employee full credit for all purposes under any Purchased Company Benefit
Plan and each other employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement by Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates (other than benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan or retiree health or welfare plan other than a Purchased
Company Benefit Plan) for such Transferred Business Employees service prior
to the Closing with Seller or any of its Affiliates, to the same extent such
service is recognized by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the
Closing under an analogous Benefit Plan; _provided_ , that such service shall
not be credited to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(c) _Health Coverages_. With respect to any group health plan or plans
maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates in which any Transferred Business
Employee is eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, to (i) use reasonable best efforts to
waive, or cause to be waived, preexisting conditions, limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods with respect to
participation by and coverage of such Transferred Business Employee (other
than any such condition, limitation, exclusion, requirement or period already
in effect under the applicable group health Benefit Plan) and (ii) provide
such Transferred Business Employee credit for the year in which the Closing
Date occurs for any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket expenses already
incurred by such Transferred Business Employee under the applicable group
health Benefit Plan to the same extent as such Transferred Business Employee
was entitled, prior to the Closing Date, to credit for such deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket expenses under the applicable analogous group health
Benefit Plan.

(d)  _Severance_. In the event that, due to Purchasers failure to (i) make
an offer of employment to a Business Employee on the terms required under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_ or (ii) provide terms and conditions of employment to a
Business Employee as required by applicable Law, a Business Employee does not
continue or accept employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which results in any obligation, contingent or otherwise, of
Seller or any of its Affiliates to pay any severance or other benefits to such
Business Employee in accordance with a severance policy or arrangement set
forth on  _Section_ __ _ 5.7(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to reimburse and otherwise
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates (including the other
Seller Entities) and their respective Affiliates for all such severance

 



76

    

 and other benefits. With respect to each Transferred Business Employee whose
employment is terminated by Purchaser or its Affiliates without Cause during
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending twelve (12) months after
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, subject to such Transferred Business
Employees execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in
favor of Purchaser and its Affiliates and Seller and its Affiliates in a form
reasonably provided by Purchaser or its Affiliate, provide such Transferred
Business Employee with severance benefits that are at least equal in value to
the severance benefits determined in accordance with the policy set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(d)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, in each case,
taking into account such Transferred Business Employees service with Seller
and its Affiliates prior to the Closing and with Purchaser and its Affiliates
on and after the Closing.

(e) _Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time_. Purchaser will
recognize all accrued but unused vacation, sick leave and personal time for
all Transferred Business Employees, which shall be treated as current
Liabilities in the Post-Closing Statement and the Final Purchase Price on a
dollar-for-dollar basis. To the extent required by applicable Law, Seller or
its Affiliates shall pay to each Transferred Business Employee all amounts in
respect of earned but unused vacation time that become due as a result of the
transfer of employment contemplated by this Section 5.7, in which case such
amounts will be excluded from all calculations of Funded Debt and Working
Capital. In addition to, and not in lieu of, any vacation and paid time off
accrued under the applicable vacation plans or policies of Purchaser or its
Affiliates, Purchaser shall allow Transferred Business Employees to use the
vacation, sick leave and personal time recognized or established in
accordance with the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(e)_ in
accordance with the terms of Sellers and its applicable Affiliates programs
in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date (the terms of which shall be
furnished to Purchaser within thirty (30) days after the date hereof).

(f) _Disability Benefits_. Seller shall be responsible for providing long-
term disability benefits to any Business Employee who was on long-term
disability leave immediately prior to the Closing Date. If any Business
Employee who is receiving long-term disability benefits as of the Closing
Date is, within twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (or any such
longer period as required by applicable Law), able to return to work,
Purchaser shall offer employment to such employee on terms consistent with
those applicable to Transferred Business Employees generally under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_. Purchaser, to the extent required under an applicable
collective bargaining or other labor Contracts, shall return to work any
inactive employee of the Business who is subject to a collective bargaining
or other labor Contract and who is receiving long-term disability benefits as
of the Closing Date, but who subsequently becomes able to return to work
within the period provided in the collective bargaining or other labor
Contract that applied to him or her immediately prior to the Closing Date
(provided that such period shall not exceed twelve (12) months, unless
required by applicable Law or the applicable Collective
Bargaining Agreement).

(g) _401(k) Plan_. Effective at the Closing, Purchaser shall establish
participation by the Transferred Business Employees in a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan or plans with a cash or deferred feature sponsored

be solely and entirely responsible for satisfying any and all Liabilities with
respect to the Transferred Business Employees (including any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof) with respect to the Assumed Benefit Plans. Neither the
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any Liability whatsoever with
respect to Transferred Business Employees for benefits under the Assumed
Benefit Plans. The Seller and Purchaser shall take all actions necessary and
appropriate to establish Purchaser as the successor to all of the Sellers
rights, duties and Liabilities with respect to the Transferred Business
Employees under the Assumed Benefit Plans.

 



78

the Business Employees to the applicable Mirror Plan and (y) assets under the
trusts designated on _Section_ __ _ 5.7(k)(ii)(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure

Closing, it will, or will cause its applicable Affiliate to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to continue to process and support green card, immigration

provide such information as shall be reasonably requested by Purchaser and its
Affiliates in connection therewith.

Section 5.9. _Intellectual Property Matters_.

 

(a) Except as set forth below, after the Closing, Purchaser, its Subsidiaries

one hundred and eighty (180) days following the Closing (the " _Transition
Period_ "), Purchaser shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) to (x) cease all
use of the JCI Marks, (y) take necessary actions to replace materials,
including signage, stationery

 



81

    

 and promotional materials in any media (including digital and electronic)
that bear the JCI Marks and (z) cause each of its Affiliates whose corporate,
trade or other names include the JCI Marks, as applicable, to change its name
to remove such JCI Marks from such name. Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries, hereby grants to Purchaser and the Purchased Subsidiaries a non-
exclusive, non-assignable license (which may be sublicensed only to their
Affiliates and vendors, distributors and other service providers solely in
connection with the operation of such sublicensing parties business, and not
for the independent use of such sublicensee) during the Transition Period to
use the JCI Marks solely in a manner consistent with past practice and
customary "phase out" use. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing shall restrict or limit Purchaser or its Affiliates
or the Purchased Non-Consolidated Ventures from using or referencing the JCI
Marks in a non-trademark manner to factually describe or provide information
regarding the historical relationship of the Business to Seller and its
Affiliates or otherwise in a manner that would constitute "fair use" under
applicable Law.

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date:

 

(i) Seller, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
(other than the Purchased Subsidiaries) hereby grants to Purchaser and the
Purchased Subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable,
fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-transferable (except as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_) and non-sublicensable (except as set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_) license under all Intellectual Property (other than
Trademarks) that (x) is owned by Seller and the above Subsidiaries as of
immediately following the Closing and (y) has been used in the Business as of
the Closing Date or at any time during the twelve (12) month period prior to
the Closing Date (the " _Seller Licensed IP_ "), in each case, to use,
reproduce, create derivative works of, modify, distribute, make, have
made, sell, offer for sale, import or otherwise commercially exploit products
and services solely in connection with the current and future operation of the
Business or any reasonable evolutions or expansions thereof.

 

(ii) Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date (including the Purchased Subsidiaries), hereby grants to Seller and its
Subsidiaries a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-
up, royalty-free, non-transferable (except as set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 5.9_) and non-sublicensable (except as set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
5.9_) license under the Owned Intellectual Property (other than Trademarks)
that has been used by Seller or its Subsidiaries in the operation of any of
their existing businesses (other than the Business) as of the Closing Date or
at any time during the twelve (12) month period prior to the Closing Date, in
each case, to use, reproduce, create derivative works of, modify, distribute,
make, have made, sell, offer for sale, import or otherwise
commercially exploit products and services solely in connection with the
current and future operation of their existing businesses or any reasonable
evolutions or expansions thereof (other than the Business).

 

(iii) The above licenses may be sublicensed by the licensed parties to (x)
their Affiliates and (y) their respective vendors, service providers,
distributors, retailers, customers and end-users, as applicable, in each case
with respect to the operation of the Business (or existing businesses or any
reasonable evolutions or expansions thereof (other than the Business), as
applicable), but, with respect to clause (y) not with respect to other
products or services of such third parties.

 



82

    

(iv) The parties hereto intend and agree that, for purposes of Section 365(n)
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (and any amendment thereto) and any equivalent Law
in any foreign jurisdiction, each of the above licenses will be treated as a
license to intellectual property (as defined in Section 101(35A) of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code).

(v) The above licenses are intended to run with the Intellectual Property
subject thereto. Each licensing party may and must transfer this license, in
whole or in part, to the acquirer of any Intellectual Property owned by a
party and subject thereto, and such acquirer shall assume its obligations in
writing or by operation of law. Any such acquirer is deemed automatically
bound by such license, regardless of whether such acquirer executes such
written assumption. Further, each licensed party may transfer the license
granted to such party, in whole or in part, to (i) an Affiliate or successor
via merger that engages in the Business or Sellers or its Subsidiaries
existing businesses or any reasonable evolutions or expansions thereof (other
than the Business), as applicable, as part of an internal reorganization
or (ii) the acquirer of one or more businesses or business lines of such
party covered by such license (or the entities owning the same), provided
that, after any such acquisition, the above licenses shall apply only to the
partys transferred businesses and not to any unrelated businesses of any
such acquirer. All other transfers of this license require the prior written
consent of the other party in its sole discretion, and are void _ab initio_
without same.

 

Section 5.10. _Insurance_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall (i) establish a cell in the White Rock
Group for the benefit of the Business (the " _New Captive Insurance Company_
") on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, which New
Captive Insurance Company shall be owned by one of the Purchased Subsidiaries
as of immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) transfer those claims, including
incurred but not reported claims, for which each of Global Risk Underwriters
(Bermuda) Ltd. and White Mountain Insurance Company are liable, to the New
Captive Insurance Company (the " _Self-Insured Claims_ "), and (iii)
capitalize the New Captive Insurance Company; _provided_ that if Purchaser and
Seller mutually agree, in lieu of the foregoing, (x) Seller shall instead use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Self-Insured Claims to be novated or
reinsured to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Purchased
Subsidiaries) effective from and after the Closing and (y) the parties shall
cooperate in good faith, from and after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing, to agree on claims procedures for the Self-Insured Claims applicable
to and appropriate for such a novation arrangement. From and after the Closing
Date, the Business, the Purchased Companies, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, and the operations and assets and Liabilities in respect
thereof, shall cease to be insured by Sellers or its Affiliates insurance
policies or by any of their self-insured programs, and neither Purchaser nor
its Affiliates (including the Business and the Purchased Companies) shall
have any access, right, title or interest to or in any such insurance policies
(including to all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds)
to cover the Business, the Purchased Companies, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities, or the operations or assets or Liabilities in respect
thereof. Seller or its Affiliates may amend any insurance policies in the
manner it deems appropriate to give effect to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_;

 



83

    

  _provided_ that (i) other than in the ordinary course, Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, release, commute, buy-back
or eliminate (whether in whole or in part) insurance coverage under any of
the Casualty Policies with respect to any Pre-Closing Insurance Occurrences
and (ii) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, agree to
amend or modify the terms of any of the Casualty Policies in a manner designed
to or reasonably expected to disproportionately and adversely affect coverage
with respect to any Pre-Closing Insurance Occurrences relative to other
coverage thereunder. Except as set forth below in _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_,
(i) from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible for securing
all insurance it considers appropriate for the Business, the Purchased
Companies, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, and the operations
and assets and Liabilities in respect thereof, (ii) at the Closing,
Purchaser agrees to take over and assume all the known and incurred but not
reported claims in respect of the Business, the Purchased Companies, the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, and the operations and assets and
Liabilities in respect thereof, which have been incurred as of the Closing,
and Purchaser agrees to be responsible to pay such claims including but not
limited to fully reinsuring Seller and its Affiliates from a Purchased Company
or Purchased Asset, (iii) Purchaser further covenants and agrees not to seek
to assert or to exercise any rights or claims of, or in respect of, the
Business, the Purchased Companies, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities, and the operations and assets and Liabilities in
respect thereof, under or in respect of any past or current insurance policy
under which any of the foregoing is a named insured and (iv) Purchaser agrees
to utilize Sellers or its Affiliates claims administrators or claims agents
for all claims prior to the Closing Date, including new claims reported after
the Closing Date, if the occurrence is before the Closing Date, in respect of
the Business, the Purchased Companies, or the Purchased Assets.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing _Section_ __ _ 5.10(a)_, from and after
the Closing Date, with respect to any actions, inactions, events, omissions,
conditions, facts, circumstances, losses, damages and Liabilities which
occurred or are alleged to have occurred, or were incurred or claimed to have
been incurred, by any of the Purchased Companies or the Business prior to the
Closing Date and with respect to the Self-Insured Claims, to the extent any
one or more claims individually are in excess of the each occurrence limits of
the New Captive Insurance Company (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Insurance
Occurrences_"), Seller will provide Purchaser with access to, and Purchaser
may, upon prior written notice to Seller, make claims under, Sellers and its
Subsidiaries third-party excess casualty insurance policies that are
"occurrence based" insurance policies in place immediately prior to the
Closing and Sellers and its Subsidiaries historical excess casualty policies
of insurance that are "occurrence based" insurance policies (" _Casualty
Policies_ ") solely to the extent that such policies provided coverage for the
Purchased Companies or the Business prior to the Closing and pursuant to the
Insurance Administration procedures set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules (the " _Insurance Administration Procedures_
"); _provided_ , that such access to, and the right to make claims under,
such insurance policies, shall be subject to the terms and conditions of such
insurance policies, including any restrictions on coverage or scope, any
deductibles, retentions or self-insurance provision, and any fees, costs, or
other expenses, and shall be subject to the following additional conditions:

(i) Purchaser shall report any potentially insured pre-Closing Date claim to
Seller, as promptly as practicable and in any event in sufficient time so that
such claim may be made in accordance with Sellers claim reporting procedures
in effect immediately prior to the Closing (or in accordance with any
modifications to such procedures after the Closing communicated by Seller to
Purchaser in writing or documented in the Insurance Administration
Procedures);

 



84

    

(ii) Purchaser, the Purchased Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries shall indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse Seller and its
Subsidiaries (excluding the Purchased Companies) for any deductible, self-
insured retention, fees and expenses incurred by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to the extent resulting from any access to, any claims made by
Purchaser, any Purchased Company or any of their Subsidiaries under any
insurance provided pursuant to Casualty Policies, including any indemnity
payments, settlements, judgments, legal fees and allocated claims expenses
and claim handling fees, whether such claims are made by Purchaser, its
employees or third Persons;

(iii) Purchaser shall exclusively bear (and neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries (excluding any of the Purchased Companies) shall have any
obligation to repay or reimburse Purchaser, any Purchased Company or any of
their Subsidiaries for) and shall be liable for all uninsured, uncovered,
unavailable or uncollectible amounts of all such claims made by Purchaser, any
Purchased Company or any of their Subsidiaries under the policies as provided
for in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_. In the event an insurance
policy/program aggregate limit is exhausted, or believed likely to be
exhausted, due to noticed claims, Purchaser, the Purchased Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller and its Subsidiaries
(excluding any of the Purchased Companies), on the other hand, shall be
responsible for their pro rata portion of the reinstatement premium if
applicable, based upon the losses of such Persons submitted to Sellers
insurance carrier(s) (including any submissions prior to the Closing) that
exhausted the applicable fiscal years policy/program aggregate limit. To the
extent that Purchaser, the Purchased Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller and its Subsidiaries
(excluding any of the Purchased Companies), on the other hand, is allocated
more than its pro rata portion of such premium due to the timing of losses
submitted to Sellers insurance carrier(s), the other party shall promptly
pay the first party an amount so that each group of Persons has been properly
allocated its pro rata portion of the reinstatement premium. Seller and
Purchaser can mutually agree not to reinstate the policy/program aggregate
limit and, in such event, each group of Persons will bear all of its own
future losses;

(iv) Claims made by Purchaser under the Casualty Policies will be subject to
(and recovery thereon will be reduced by the amount of) any applicable
deductibles, retentions, or self-insurance provisions. With respect to any
deductibles, retentions or self-insurance provisions described in the
immediately preceding sentence that require a payment by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (excluding any of the Purchased Companies), Purchaser shall
reimburse Seller or such Subsidiary for its pro rata portion of such payment
based on Purchaser or the Purchased Companies interest in such claim. It is
understood that any insurance policy that is not "occurrence based" may not
provide any coverage to Purchaser, the Purchased Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries for incidents occurring prior to the Closing but that are
asserted with the insurance carrier after the Closing; and

 



85

    

(v) To the extent that an annual retrospective adjustment by a
Seller insurance carrier results from a claim made by Purchaser or related to
the Business and such adjustment causes the premium paid or payable by Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any of the Purchased Companies) to such
insurance carrier to increase by more than the Premium Threshold, then Seller
shall promptly notify Purchaser of such increase. If either Seller or
Purchaser determine that it is appropriate to request that the Seller
insurance carrier reconsider the adjustment amount or the premium
calculation, then subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.10(e)_, the parties hereto
shall cooperate in good faith and assist each other in making such request and
engaging in discussions with the Seller insurance carrier. After the final
determination of the premium calculation, or if neither Seller nor Purchaser
makes a request in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, then
Purchaser shall reimburse Seller or its applicable Subsidiary for the excess
of any increase over the Premium Threshold. The "Premium Threshold" shall
equal an amount to be mutually agreed in writing by Seller and Purchaser and
set forth in the Insurance Administration Procedures.

 

In the event that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any of the
Purchased Companies) incurs any losses, damages or Liability prior to or in
respect of the period prior to the Closing for which Seller or such Subsidiary
is entitled to coverage under Purchasers, the Purchased Companies or their
Subsidiaries insurance policies (if any), the same process pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_ shall apply, substituting "Seller" for "Purchaser"
and "Purchaser" for "Seller".

 

(c) Purchaser, the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries, in connection
with making a claim under any insurance policy of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (excluding any of the Purchased Companies) pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid
taking any action (other than the act of making the claim) that would
be reasonably likely to (i) have an adverse impact on the then-current
relationship between Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any of the
Purchased Companies), on the one hand, and the applicable insurance company,
on the other hand; (ii) result in the applicable insurance company
terminating or reducing coverage, or increasing the amount of any premium owed
by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any of the Purchased
Companies) under the applicable insurance policy; or (iii) otherwise
compromise, jeopardize or interfere with the rights of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (excluding any of the Purchased Companies) under the applicable
insurance policy. Seller and its Subsidiaries (excluding the Purchased
Companies), in connection with Insurance Administration on behalf of
Purchaser, the Purchased Companies or any of their Subsidiaries under any
insurance policy or program of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding
any of the Purchased Companies) pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid taking any action (other than the
act of making the claim) that would be reasonably likely to (i) have an
adverse impact on the then-current relationship between Purchaser, the
Purchased Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the
applicable insurance company, on the other hand, (ii) result in the applicable
insurance company terminating or reducing coverage, or increasing the amount
of any premium owed by Purchaser, the Purchased Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries under the applicable insurance policy; or (iii) otherwise
compromise, jeopardize or interfere with the rights of Purchaser, the
Purchased Companies or any of their Subsidiaries under the applicable
insurance policy, in each case of clauses (i) through (iii), if such insurance
company is also an insurer of Purchaser, the Purchased Companies or any of
their Subsidiaries.

(d) All payments and reimbursements by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_ will be made within thirty (30) days after Sellers
receipt or Purchasers receipt, as applicable, of an invoice therefor from
Purchaser or Seller, as applicable. If either party hereto incurs costs to
enforce the other partys obligations herein, such party agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless such other party for such enforcement costs,
including reasonable attorneys fees. Except as mutually agreed and set forth
in the Insurance Administration Procedures, Seller shall retain
responsibility for and have the exclusive right to control Insurance
Administration and any and all other rights with respect to its insurance
policies and programs, including the right to exhaust, settle, release,
commute, buyback or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its
insurance policies and programs and to amend, modify or waive any rights under
any such insurance policies and programs, notwithstanding whether any such
policies or programs apply to any Purchaser Liabilities and/or claims
Purchaser has made or could make in the future. None of Purchaser, the
Purchased Companies or any of their Subsidiaries shall, without the prior
written consent of Seller, erode, exhaust, settle, release, commute, buyback
or otherwise resolve disputes with Sellers insurers with respect to any of
Sellers insurance policies and programs, or amend, modify or waive any rights
under any such insurance policies and programs. Purchaser shall cooperate
with Seller and share such information as is reasonably necessary in order to
permit Seller to manage and conduct its insurance matters as it deems
appropriate. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries (excluding the
Purchased Companies) shall have any obligation to secure extended reporting
for any claims under any insurance policies for any acts or omissions by
Purchaser, the Purchased Companies or any of their Subsidiaries incurred prior
to the Closing.

(e) Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (excluding the Purchased
Companies) to, (i) use commercially reasonable efforts, at Purchasers
reasonable request (and provided that Purchaser complies with the requirements
of _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_), to assist Purchaser in making claims under the
Seller insurance programs described in  _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_, (ii) notify
Purchaser within a commercially reasonable period of time after any election
by Seller to control any claim under a Seller insurance policy or program to
the extent such claim relates to the Purchased Asset and/or Assumed
Liability, (iii) within a commercially reasonable period of time after
Sellers receipt thereof, pay over to Purchaser, the Purchased Companies or
their Subsidiaries, as applicable, any Insurance Proceeds that are received
by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any of the Purchased
Companies) in respect of such claims and (iv) otherwise perform Insurance
Administration on behalf of Purchaser, the Purchased Companies or any of
their Subsidiaries, as described in _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_, using a
standard of care consistent with the standard that Seller and its applicable
Subsidiaries (excluding the Purchased Companies) use when performing
Insurance Administration on behalf of Seller and its Subsidiaries (excluding
the Purchased Companies).

(f) This Agreement shall not be considered as an attempted assignment of any
policy of insurance or as a contract of insurance and shall not be construed
to waive any right or remedy of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding
the Purchased Companies) in respect of any insurance policy or any other
contract or policy of insurance.

Section 5.11. _Litigation Support_. In the event that and for so long as
Seller or any of its Affiliates or Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is
prosecuting, contesting or defending any Proceeding or Action or claim by a
third party or otherwise for legal compliance in connection with (a) the
Transaction or any of the other transactions contemplated under this
Agreement, or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,

 



87

    

 incident, action, failure to act, or transaction relating to, in connection
with or arising from the Business, the Purchased Companies, the Purchased
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Excluded Assets or the Retained
Liabilities, to the extent permitted by Law and contractual obligations,
Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (and
its and their officers and employees) to, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser
and Seller, respectively, and its counsel (at such requesting partys cost) in
such prosecution, contest or defense, including by using commercially
reasonable efforts to make available its personnel and provide such testimony
and access to its books and records as shall be reasonably necessary and
requested by such requesting party in connection with such prosecution,
contest or defense; _provided_ that, Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and
agree that this  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall not apply with respect to any
Proceeding or other Action with respect to which Purchaser and/or its
Affiliates are adverse to Seller and/or its Affiliates.

 

Section 5.12. _Payments_.

 

(a) Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, promptly pay or
deliver to Purchaser (or its designated Affiliates) any monies or checks that
have been sent to Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date by
customers, suppliers or other contracting parties of the Business or the
Purchased Companies to the extent that they are in respect of a Purchased
Asset or Assumed Liability hereunder or are for the account of a Purchased
Company.

(b) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, promptly pay
or deliver to Seller (or its designated Affiliates) any monies or checks that
have been sent to Purchaser (including the Business and the Purchased
Companies) after the Closing Date to the extent that they are in respect of
an Excluded Asset or Retained Liability hereunder.

Section 5.13. _Pre-Closing  Reorganization_.

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable
Affiliates (including the Seller Entities and the Purchased Subsidiaries) to
use reasonable best efforts to complete the transactions set forth on the Pre-
Closing Reorganization Steps Plan attached to _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules (the " _Step Plan_ ") substantially as
described therein in compliance with applicable Law (after taking into account
any amendments, changes or other modifications pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
5.13(b)_ below) (such transactions, collectively, the " _Pre-Closing
Reorganization_"), including (i) obtaining all Approvals of all Governmental
Entities and under all Permits and (ii) using reasonable best efforts to
obtain all material Approvals of all third parties, in each case that are
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Pre-Closing
Reorganization. For the avoidance of doubt, the Pre-Closing Reorganization
will not include the transfer of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser.

 

(b) Seller will (i) (A) disclose to Purchaser any material amendments, waivers
or other modifications to the Pre-Closing Reorganization that could reasonably
be expected to adversely impact Purchaser not later than fifteen (15) days
prior to executing any such amendment, waiver or other modification, (B)
consult with Purchaser in good faith with respect to any such material
amendment, waiver or other modification, and (C) promptly provide any
information reasonably requested by Purchaser for the purpose of evaluating
whether such proposed amendment, waiver or other modification could
reasonably be expected to adversely impact Purchaser, and (ii) not

 



88

    

 make without Purchasers prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), any amendments, waivers or
other modifications to the Pre-Closing Reorganization which could be
reasonably be expected to (A) increase a Tax liability, or decrease a Tax
Asset, of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing the
Purchased Companies), in each case, by more than a nominal amount, unless, in
the case of an increased Tax liability, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is
fully indemnified for such Tax liability under this Agreement or Seller
otherwise agrees to fully indemnify Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect
thereto, (B) impose any Liability on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other
than any Assumed Liability) or increase any Assumed Liability, unless
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is fully indemnified for such Liability
under this Agreement or Seller otherwise agrees to fully indemnify Purchaser
or its Affiliates with respect thereto, (C) require any additional Approval of
any Governmental Entity or third party that would reasonably be expected to
materially impair or delay in any material respect Sellers or Purchasers
ability to consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or (D)
adversely affect Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in any material respect.
Each of Seller and Purchaser understands and agrees that any transfers,
assignments, sales or other dispositions of assets, interests, rights, capital
stock or otherwise, whether from a Purchased Company to a Seller Entity
or one or more of its Affiliates, or from a Seller Entity or one or more of
its Affiliates to a Purchased Company, shall be made on an "as-is", "where-
is" basis, without representation or warranty of any kind, and without
recourse to the recipient thereof, and without recourse to the party making
such transfer, assignment, sale or other disposition (it being agreed that
neither the foregoing nor the documentation in respect of such transfers shall
limit, modify or otherwise affect any of the representations or warranties, or
any remedies of the parties expressly provided hereunder). For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties hereto intend that Purchaser shall directly acquire the
Purchased Entity Shares with respect to the HK Company and the Specified Non-
Consolidated Venture Interests at the Closing from a Seller Entity, and
Seller shall not make any changes to the Pre-Closing Organization or otherwise
that is not consistent with such intention. To the extent Seller updates the
Pre-Closing Reorganization, Seller shall, within a reasonable period of time
after such update, provide a copy of the updated Step Plan reflecting such
changes to Purchaser.

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) for purposes of clause (i) of _Section_ __
_ 5.13(b)_, an amendment, waiver or modification shall be treated as
"material" if such amendment, waiver or modification would (A) change the
classification of any Purchased Company for Tax purposes, (B) change the
jurisdiction of formation or Tax residency of any Purchased Company, (C) form
or organize an entity that will be transferred to Purchaser in connection with
the transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement, (D) make or change a
Tax election in respect of a Purchased Company or Purchased Assets or (E)
result in a loss of tax basis in the assets of any Purchased Company, in each
case, in a manner not expressly contemplated by the Step Plan as of the date
of this Agreement, and (ii) for purposes of clause (ii) of _Section_ __ _
5.13(b)_, any failure to complete a transaction set forth in the Step Plan
shall be deemed to be an amendment, waiver or modification. For the avoidance
of doubt, for purposes of clause (i) of  _Section_ __ _ 5.13(b)_, an
amendment, waiver or modification shall be treated as not "material" if such
amendment, waiver or modification would solely (i) (A) involve a transfer
of non-operational assets to a member of the Seller Entities or (B) involve a
transfer of operational assets (provided that all such transfers pursuant to
this clause (i) and pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)(iv)(C)_ (excluding
any transfers of Cash and Cash Equivalents) do not exceed $5,000,000 in the
aggregate), (ii) cause the conversion of statutory earnings into capital and
statutory capital into earnings to facilitate the distribution of cash, cash
equivalents and non-operational assets, (iii) effectuate a distribution as a
redemption or repurchase of equity, or (iv) effectuate a distribution as
a repayment of a loan.

Section 5.14. _Non-Solicitation of Employees; Non-Competition_.

(a) For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, as to any individual who was an officer or other
member of Senior Management of the Business immediately prior to the Closing
and became employed by Purchaser or Purchasers Subsidiaries as of
immediately following the Closing (a " _Covered Person_ "), Seller agrees
that none of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries will (and that Seller will
cause its Subsidiaries not to), directly or indirectly, solicit for employment
any Covered Person;  _provided_ , that Seller Entities shall not be precluded
from soliciting, or taking any other action with respect to any such
individual (i) whose employment ceased at least three (3) months prior to
commencement of employment discussions between any Seller Entity and such
individual or (ii) who responds to general solicitations not specifically
targeted at employees of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including through
any search firm or recruiting agency so long as such search firm or
recruiting agency has not been directed to target employees of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates); and _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller and its
Affiliates shall not be restricted from engaging in general solicitations or
advertising not targeted at any such Persons described above. The parties
hereto agree that if a Covered Person requests that Purchaser waive the non-
solicitation restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.14(a)_ with
respect to that Covered Person, Purchaser shall consider such request in good
faith.

 

(b) For a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, Seller agrees not to engage in the Business;
_provided_ , that nothing herein shall preclude Seller from:

(i) five percent (5%) or less of the outstanding securities of any Person
listed on a national securities exchange; _provided_ that (i) such securities
are held for investment purposes only and (ii) such securities do not give
Seller or any of its Affiliates the right to designate any of the members of
the board of directors (or similar governing body) of such Person or business
and Seller or any of its Affiliates do not have any representatives on such
board (or similar governing body);

 

(ii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) that is engaged in a business activity that would
otherwise violate this _Section_ __ _ 5.14(b)_ (a " _Competing Business_ "),
if such Competing Business generated both (A) less than ten percent (10%) and
(B) less than $250 million, in each case, of such Persons consolidated
annual revenues in the last completed fiscal year of such Person;

(iii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) that is engaged in a Competing Business if (A) such
Competing Business generated (I) ten percent (10%) or more (but in no event
greater than twenty percent (20%)) or (II) more than $250 million (but in no
event greater than $500 million), in each case, of such Persons consolidated
annual revenues in the last completed fiscal year of such Person and (B)
Seller enters, within one (1) year after the consummation of such
acquisition, into a definitive agreement to cause the divestiture of a
sufficient portion of the Competing

 



90

    

Business of such Person such that the restrictions set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.14(b)_ would not operate to restrict such ownership and has
completed such disposition within eighteen (18) months of the date of such
definitive agreement (the " _Divestiture Period_ ");  _provided_ , that if
such divestiture has not been consummated due to (x) any applicable waiting
period (including extension thereof) applicable to such divestiture under the
HSR Act, or under any other applicable Law not having expired or been
terminated, or (y) the failure to procure or obtain any required governmental
or regulatory consents, approvals, permits or authorizations applicable to
such divestiture, then the Divestiture Period will automatically be extended
so that it expires one (1) week following the later of the expiration or
termination of such waiting period and the procurement or obtainment of all
such consents, approvals, permits and authorizations; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that prior to Seller or any of its Affiliates selling all or any portion of
the Competing Business to a third party (the " _Offered Divestiture Business_
"), (x) Seller shall provide written notice to Purchaser, which notice shall
include the description of the Offered Divestiture Business proposed to be
sold, (y) upon delivery by Seller of such written notice, Purchaser shall have
a thirty (30)-day period (the " _Divestiture Offer Proposal Period_ ") in
which to propose to acquire the Offered Divestiture Business by delivering to
Seller a written notice detailing the consideration proposed for the Offered
Divestiture Business (the " _Divestiture Offer Price_ ") and all other
material terms and conditions of such offer, and which notice shall constitute
an offer by Purchaser to purchase such Offered Divestiture Business from
Seller at the Divestiture Offer Price and on the other terms and conditions
set forth in such notice (the " _Divestiture Offer_ "), and (z) (1) if
Purchaser delivers a Divestiture Offer to Seller within the Divestiture Offer
Proposal Period and, within fifteen (15) days (the " _Divestiture Offer
Acceptance Period_ ") of delivery by Purchaser of such written notice, Seller
accepts such Divestiture Offer by delivering to Purchaser a written notice of
such acceptance, (a) Purchaser shall purchase and pay, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller, for the
Offered Divestiture Business within ninety (90) days after the date of the
Divestiture Offer Acceptance ( _provided_ , that if such purchase has
not been consummated due to (x) any applicable waiting period (including
extension thereof) applicable to such divestiture under the HSR Act, or under
any other applicable Law not having expired or been terminated, or (y) the
failure to procure or obtain any required governmental or regulatory
consents, approvals, permits or authorizations applicable to such divestiture,
then such period will automatically be extended so that it expires one (1)
week following the expiration or termination of such waiting period and the
procurement or obtainment of all such consents, approvals, permits and
authorizations), and (b) Purchaser and Seller shall concurrently execute such
documents as are reasonably required by Seller in connection with the sale of
the Offered Divestiture Business to Purchaser, and (2) if (A) Purchaser fails
to deliver a Divestiture Offer within the Divestiture Offer Proposal Period or
(B) Seller fails to accept a Divestiture Offer within the Divestiture Offer
Acceptance Period or rejects a Divestiture Offer within the Divestiture Offer
Acceptance Period, Seller shall have the right to, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to, effect a sale to any other Person of the Offered Divestiture
Business on substantially the same or more favorable (as to Seller) terms and
conditions as were set forth in the Divestiture Offer at a price greater (by
more than a _de minimis_ amount) than the Divestiture Offer Price; 
_provided_ , further, that if Seller fails to effect a sale on such terms
within the Divestiture Period, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith
such that (i) Seller effects a sale to Purchaser at the Divestiture Offer
Price at Purchasers election, (ii) the Divestiture Period shall be extended
for a reasonable period of time, or (iii) Seller shall be permitted to effect
a sale of the Offered Divestiture Business to any other Person at a price
lower than the Divestiture Offer Price;

 



91

    

(iv) exercising its rights or complying with its obligations under
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents; or

(v) providing or engaging in activities, services, products or systems of a
nature provided by Seller (or any of its Affiliates) apart from the Business
as of the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date and reasonable extensions
thereof.

 

The parties understand and acknowledge that immaterial and inadvertent
violations of this _Section_ __ _ 5.14(b)_ by Seller shall not be deemed a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.14(b)_.

Section 5.15. _Misallocated Assets_. If, following the Closing, any right,
property or asset not included in the Purchased Assets is found to have been
transferred to Purchaser in error, either directly or indirectly (including as
a result of the Pre-Closing Reorganization), Purchaser shall transfer, or
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) to transfer, at
no additional cost, such right, property or asset (and any related Liability)
as soon as practicable to the Seller Entity indicated by Seller. If,
following the Closing, any right, property or asset included in the Purchased
Assets is found to have been retained by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in
error, either directly or indirectly (including as a result of the Pre-Closing
Reorganization), Seller shall transfer, or shall cause its Subsidiary to
transfer, at no cost, such right, property or asset (and any related
Liability) as soon as practicable to Purchaser or an Affiliate (including a
Purchased Entity) indicated by Purchaser.

Section 5.16. _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Commitment Letters
(including complying with any request requiring the exercise of so-called
"market flex" provisions in the fee letter) as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof, including using reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in
full force and effect the Commitment Letters, (B) negotiate and execute
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex"
provisions applicable thereto) or on terms that, taken as a whole, are no
less favorable in the aggregate to Purchaser than the terms contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions applicable
thereto), in each case, which terms shall not in any respect expand on
the conditions to the funding of the Financing at the Closing or reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing available to be funded at the Closing (such
definitive agreement, the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_ ") and (C)
satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions and
covenants applicable to Purchaser in the Commitment Letters and such
Definitive Financing Agreements that are to be satisfied by Purchaser and are
within its control and to consummate the Financing at or prior to the
Closing, which such reasonable best efforts shall include, for the avoidance
of doubt, taking enforcement action (including through litigation) to cause
the Debt Financing Sources, lenders and other Persons committing to provide
the Financing to comply with

 



92

    

 their obligations under the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing
Agreements and, upon satisfaction of the conditions to Closing thereunder, to
cause such Persons to fund such Financing on (or prior to) the Closing Date
and (ii) comply with their obligations under the Commitment Letters and the
Definitive Financing Agreements and enforce their rights under the Commitment
Letters. Purchaser shall obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the
Equity Commitment Letter upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Closing in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ (other than those
conditions that are by their nature to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing).
Purchaser shall keep Seller informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of any material developments concerning the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and, at Sellers request, Purchaser
shall allow Seller to reasonably consult with the Debt Financing Sources and
providers of the Debt Financing regarding the status of such Financing (
_provided_ that Purchaser shall have the right to have one or more
Representatives present during any such consultation). Purchaser shall provide
Seller with copies of any Definitive Financing Agreements and such other
information and documentation regarding the Debt Financing as shall be
reasonably requested by Seller in writing and necessary to allow Seller to
monitor the progress of such financing activities.

 

(b) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including any "market flex" provisions applicable
thereto) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Purchaser shall promptly
notify Seller and Purchaser shall use, and shall cause the Guarantor to use,
their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources
in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is
and remains available to Purchaser, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all Financing Uses (" _Alternative
Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event and to obtain and provide Seller with a copy of, the new financing
commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing (the " _Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter_ "), which Alternative Financing Commitment Letter
(or Alternative Financing) will not (i) include terms and conditions
(including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto) that are
materially less beneficial (or worse) to Purchaser than those contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions applicable
thereto), (ii) involve any conditions to funding of the Debt Financing that
are not contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, or (iii) reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede, or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that Purchaser shall not be
required to enter into any Alternative Financing Commitment Letter (or
consummate any Alternative Financing) that would require Purchaser to pay
fees or interest rates (including pursuant to any "market flex" provisions) in
excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the
date hereof (including any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto). In
furtherance of, and not in limitation of, the foregoing, in the event that any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason
therefor, but any bridge facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter (or alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.16(b)_) are available on the terms and conditions described
in the Debt Commitment Letter (or replacements thereof), then Purchaser shall
cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in lieu of such
contemplated Debt Financing as promptly as practicable. As applicable,
references in this Agreement (other than with respect to representations in
this Agreement made by Purchaser that speak as of the date hereof) (i) to
Financing or Debt Financing shall include any such Alternative Financing, (ii)
to the Commitment Letters or Debt Commitment Letter shall include any such
Alternative Financing Commitment Letter and (iii) to Definitive Financing
Agreements shall include the definitive documentation relating to any such
Alternative Financing.

 



93

    

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.16(b)_,
Purchaser shall promptly (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days)
notify Seller in writing of the occurrence of any of the following of which
Purchaser becomes aware: (i) termination, repudiation, rescission,
cancellation or expiration of any Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing
Agreement, (ii) any material breach or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any material breach or default) under any Commitment
Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement by any party to such Commitment
Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement, (iii) receipt by any of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any written notice or other
written communication from any Debt Financing Source, any lender or any other
Person with respect to any (A) actual, threatened or alleged material breach,
default, termination, rescission or repudiation by any party to any
Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement or any provision of any
Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement (including any proposal by
any Debt Financing Source, lender or other Person to withdraw, terminate,
repudiate, rescind or make a material change in the terms of (including the
amount of Financing contemplated) any Commitment Letter) or (B) material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any Commitment Letter
or Definitive Financing Agreement, or (iv) if for any reason Purchaser in
good faith believes that (A) there is (or there is reasonably likely to be) a
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Financing Agreement with respect to the
obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded
at the Closing or (B) there is a reasonable possibility that it will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in
the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Financing Agreements; _provided_ that in no event shall Purchaser
be under any obligation to disclose any information that would waive the
protection of attorney-client or similar privilege if Purchaser has used its
reasonable best efforts to disclose the substance of such information in a way
that would not waive such privilege. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in
any event within two (2) Business Days, Purchaser shall provide to Seller and
its Representatives any and all information reasonably requested by Seller
relating to any of the circumstances referred to in this _Section_ __ _
5.16(c)_.

 

(d) Purchaser shall not permit or consent to or agree to (i) any amendment,
restatement, replacement, supplement, termination or other modification or
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Equity Commitment Letter (other
than to increase the amount of Equity Financing available thereunder), (ii)
any amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination or
other modification or waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt
Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement if such amendment,
restatement, supplement, termination, modification or waiver would (A) impose
new or additional conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing
or would otherwise change, amend, modify or expand any of the conditions
precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing, in any such case, from those
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter on the date of this Agreement, (B)
adversely change the timing of the funding of the Debt Financing thereunder,
(C) be reasonably expected to impair, delay or prevent the availability of all
or a portion of the Debt Financing or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (D) reduce the aggregate cash amount of the
Debt Financing

 



94

    

 (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing (except as set forth in any "market flex"
provisions existing on the date of this Agreement) to less than the amount
necessary to permit Purchaser to effect the Closing (taking into account any
increase in the Equity Financing)) or (E) otherwise materially adversely
affect the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the timing of the Closing, including by making the funding of the
Financing less likely to occur or (iii) the early termination of the
Commitment Letters or any Definitive Financing Agreement; _provided_ ,
however, for the avoidance of doubt (and, without limitation, as to other
amendments not restricted hereby or prohibited to be made hereunder),
Purchaser may (1) amend, replace, supplement or modify the Debt Commitment
Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities as parties thereto who had not executed the Debt Commitment
Letter as of the date hereof or (2) terminate the Debt Commitment Letter if
and to the extent such Debt Commitment Letter is concurrently replaced with a
new Debt Commitment Letter that would satisfy the preceding clause (ii).
Purchaser shall furnish to Seller a copy of any amendment,
restatement, replacement, supplement, modification, waiver or consent of or
relating to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive Financing Agreements
promptly upon execution thereof. For purposes of this Agreement (other than
with respect to representations in this Agreement made by Purchaser that
speak as of the date hereof), references to the "Commitment Letters" shall
include such document as permitted or required by this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_
to be amended, restated, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified or
waived, in each case from and after such amendment, restatement, replacement,
supplement or other modification or waiver and, for the avoidance of doubt,
references to "Debt Financing" shall include, in whole or in part (as
applicable), any replacement or substitute financing provided for thereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.16_ shall require Purchaser to seek the
Equity Financing from any source other than those counterparty to the Equity
Commitment Letter.

(e) If the Debt Commitment Letters are replaced, amended, supplemented or
modified, including as a result of obtaining Alternative Financing, or if

scope of the assistance required under this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ as compared
to the assistance that would be required or expected to be required in
connection with the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the date of this
Agreement and the related Debt Financing is changed or expanded, Seller and
the Purchased Companies shall be deemed to have complied with this _Section_
__ _ 5.17_ for purposes of  _Article_ __ _ VIII_ of this Agreement if
Seller and the Purchased Companies have provided Purchaser with the assistance

Alternative Financing), in each case without giving effect to any Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter or Alternative Financing to the extent such
Alternative Financing Commitment Letter or Alternative Financing provide for
such additional or different requirements. Seller hereby consents to the use

judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
Debt Financing and the performance of their respective obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.17_ and the provision of any information utilized in
connection therewith, in each case, other than to the extent any of the
foregoing was suffered or incurred as a result of the gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct of Seller and its Subsidiaries (including, prior
to the Closing, the Purchased Companies), as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision. Purchaser
shall, promptly upon request of Seller, reimburse Seller and its Subsidiaries,
including the Purchased Companies, for all out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses incurred by Seller or its Subsidiaries, including the Business and
the Purchased Companies, (including those of its Affiliates and
Representatives) in connection with the cooperation required by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.17_.

 



99

the provisions contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ represent the sole
obligation of Seller, its Subsidiaries, the Purchased Companies and their

connection with the arrangement of the Financing and no other provision of
this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed
to expand or modify such obligations.

commencement of the Marketing Period, Seller shall (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish to Purchaser the audited financial information
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 that is Compliant and comprises a

or any past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee or
advisor of any of the foregoing based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement is intended to, nor shall
it have the effect of, limiting or diminishing Purchasers (or Sellers, its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees,
agents, successors and assignees) or any other Persons right to seek or
obtain recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy.

value) (any of the foregoing, an " _Acquisition_ "); _provided_ , however,
that any Qualifying Transaction (as such term is defined in _Section_ __ _

action or transaction by Purchaser, the Purchased Subsidiaries or
their respective Subsidiaries outside of the ordinary course of business on
the Closing Date after the Closing; (D) any Taxes arising out of or resulting
from any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this

of, if any, (x) any amount required to be included by Seller or any of its

Purchased Company for the tax year of Seller or such Affiliate that includes
the Closing Date, over (y) the amount that would have been required to be
included by Seller or any of its Affiliates in income under Section 951(a) of
the Code with respect to a Purchased Company for the tax year of Seller or

Closing Date. To the extent the foregoing is not permitted or required by
applicable Law, for purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle
Period, (i) Property Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be equal
to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period

days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) allocable to the Pre-
Closing Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the end
of the day on the final day of the Pre-Closing Period; _provided_ , that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis
(including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions)
shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period
in proportion to the number of days in each period.

Section 6.4. _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared (i) any combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Purchased Companies), on the one hand, and any of
the Purchased Companies or their respective Subsidiaries, on the other hand (a
" _Combined Tax Return_ "), and (ii) any Tax Return (other than any Combined
Tax Return) that is required to be filed by or with respect to any of the
Purchased Subsidiaries for any taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return_"). Seller shall deliver,
or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser for its review and comment all Pre-
Closing Separate Tax Returns that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date (taking into account any extensions) at least twenty (20) days prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Returns (taking into account any extensions).
Seller shall revise such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns to reflect any
reasonable comments received from Purchaser not later than five (5) days
before the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions). Purchaser
shall timely file or cause to be timely filed such Tax Returns. Purchaser
shall not amend or revoke any Combined Tax Return or any Pre-Closing Separate
Tax Returns (or any notification or election relating thereto) without the
prior written consent of Seller. At Sellers reasonable request, Purchaser
shall file, or cause to be filed, amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns.
Purchaser shall promptly provide (or cause to be provided) to Seller any

_Straddle Period Separate Tax Return_ "), Purchaser shall prepare and timely
file or cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to
the Purchased Subsidiaries. In the case of a Straddle Period Separate Tax
Return, whichever of Purchaser or Seller (indirectly through a Seller Entity)
owned the relevant Purchased Subsidiary for the greater portion of the
applicable Straddle Period shall file such Straddle Period Separate Tax
Return. Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall prepare or cause to be
prepared any Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
past practices of the Purchased Subsidiaries, except to the extent required by
applicable Law. Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall deliver to
other party for its review, comment and approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) a copy of such Straddle Period
Separate Tax Returns at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date thereof
(taking into account any extensions). Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,
shall revise such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return to reflect any
reasonable comments received from the other party not later than five (5) days
before the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions). Purchaser
shall not amend or revoke any such Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns (or
any notification or election relating thereto) without the prior written
consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). At Sellers reasonable request, Purchaser shall
file, or cause to be filed, amended Straddle Period Separate Tax Returns.

Section 6.5. _Certain Tax Benefits, Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks_.

the Purchased Subsidiaries) actually realizes a Tax Benefit as a result of
any audit adjustment (or adjustment in any other Tax Proceeding) made with
respect to any Tax Item by any Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes for
which Seller is responsible under  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ __ in any of the two
(2) taxable

 



105

    

 years after the taxable year that is the subject of such adjustment or any
prior year, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of such Tax Benefit
within fifteen (15) days of filing the Tax Return in which such Tax Benefit
is realized, determined on a "with and without" basis, and net of all out-of-
pocket expenses of Purchaser or such Affiliate.

(b) Seller shall be entitled to (i) any refunds of any Taxes or credits
received in lieu of refunds of any Taxes for which Seller is responsible
under _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, and (ii) any refunds or credits received in lieu
of refunds to which Seller is entitled under _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_, in each
case to the extent not taken into account in the determination of Working
Capital on the Post-Closing Statement and the Final Purchase Price on a
dollar-for-dollar basis. Purchaser shall be entitled to any refunds or
credits of the Purchased Subsidiaries of or against any Taxes other than
refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled pursuant to the foregoing
sentence. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Purchased Subsidiaries or
their respective Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between Seller and Purchaser in accordance with the principles set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _
6.5(b)_. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled, in whole or in part, pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)._ Each party shall pay, or cause its
Affiliates to pay, to the party entitled to a refund or credit of Taxes under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_, the amount of such refund or credit (including
any interest paid thereon and net of any out-of-pocket costs (including Taxes)
to the party receiving such refund or credit in respect of the receipt or
accrual of such refund or credit) in readily available funds within fifteen
(15) days of the actual receipt of the refund or credit or the application of
such refund or credit against amounts otherwise payable.

 

(c) Purchaser shall cause the Purchased Subsidiaries to carry forward, where
permitted by applicable Law, any item of loss, deduction or credit which
arises in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date (a " _Subsequent
Loss_ ") into any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date. If a
Subsequent Loss is not permitted by applicable Law to be carried forward into
any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be
entitled to any refund of Taxes (net of any out-of-pocket costs (including
Taxes) to the party receiving such refund in respect of the receipt of such
refund) resulting from any carry back of such Subsequent Loss into any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.6. _Tax Contests_.

 

(a) If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the party to this
Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide
written notice thereof to the other party or parties to this Agreement;
_provided_ , that the failure of such party to give such prompt notice shall
not relieve the other party of any of its obligations under this  _Article_
__ _ VI_, except to the extent that the other party is materially prejudiced
by such failure (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). Such
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and
shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received
from the Taxing Authority.

(b) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any of the
Purchased Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date (other than a Tax Proceeding described in _Section_ __ _ 6.6(d)_),
Seller shall have the exclusive right to control, at its own expense, such
Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , that Seller shall not settle, compromise or
abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of
Purchaser (which consent shall 

 



106

    

 not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement,
compromise or abandonment would have an adverse impact on Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Period. Seller may elect in writing not
to control any Tax Proceeding that Seller otherwise has the right to control
pursuant to the preceding sentence. If Seller makes such election with respect
to a Tax Proceeding, Purchaser shall have the right and obligation to
conduct, at its own expense, such Tax Proceeding, and the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_ shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_ (substituting all
references therein to "the Controlling Party" with "Purchaser" and all
references therein to "the Non-Controlling Party" with "Seller"), with respect
to such Tax Proceeding.

 

(c) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to (A) any of the
Purchased Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period (other than a Tax Proceeding
described in _Section_ __ _ 6.6(d)_) or (B) Taxes that are Excluded Business
Taxes and Taxes that are not Excluded Business Taxes, in each case, other than
Taxes imposed on any of the Purchased Companies (and such Tax Proceeding for
Taxes that are Excluded Business Taxes is not separable from such Tax
Proceeding for Taxes that are not Excluded Business Taxes), the Controlling
Party shall have the right and obligation to conduct, at its own expense, such
Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , that (i) the Controlling Party shall provide the
Non-Controlling Party with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each
stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) the Controlling Party shall consult with
the Non-Controlling Party before taking any significant action in connection
with such Tax Proceeding, (iii) the Controlling Party shall consult with the
Non-Controlling Party and offer the Non-Controlling Party an opportunity to
comment before submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in
connection with such Tax Proceeding, (iv) the Controlling Party shall defend
such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party
in interest in connection with such Tax Proceeding, and (v) the Controlling
Party shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent of the Non-Controlling Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Controlling Party" shall mean Seller if Seller
and its Affiliates are reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax liability
in connection with such Tax Proceeding, or Purchaser if Purchaser and its
Affiliates are reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax liability in
connection with such Tax Proceeding; and "Non-Controlling Party" means
whichever of Seller or Purchaser is not the Controlling Party with respect to
such Tax Proceeding.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
have the exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax
Proceeding with respect to (i) any Tax Return of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Purchased Companies); and (ii) any Tax Return of
a consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any Combined Tax Return).

request from Seller, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to Seller a package of Tax information materials, including schedules
and work papers, reasonably requested by Seller to enable Seller to prepare
and file all Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by it with respect
to the Purchased Subsidiaries and with respect to Excluded Business Taxes.
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare such package in
good faith and in a manner and on a timeline requested by Seller, which
information and timeline shall be consistent with the past practice of the
Purchased Subsidiaries and Seller.

 



107

    

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to the other party to this Agreement such cooperation, documentation
and information as either of them reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a liability
for Taxes or an indemnity obligation under this _Article_ __ _ VI_ or a
right to refund of Taxes, or (iii) conducting any Tax Proceeding. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing necessary powers of
attorney, copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together
with all relevant portions of relevant accompanying schedules and relevant
work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
Taxing Authorities and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax
basis of property and other information, which any such party may possess.
Each party shall make its employees reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any documents or
information so provided.

(c) Each party to this Agreement shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and
work papers, and all material records and other documents relating to Tax
matters, of the relevant entities for their respective Tax periods ending on

Agreement), if any, to which any of the Purchased Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the

respective Subsidiaries shall have any rights or obligations thereunder after
the Closing.

their respective Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under _Section_
__ _ 2.9_, and any and all payments for indemnification under _Section_ __ _
6.1_, _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ and _Article_ __ _ IX_ in accordance
with relevant U.S. federal, state and foreign Tax Law purposes.

under Section 338(g) of the Code (or any comparable election under state,
local or foreign Law) with respect to the acquisition of any Purchased
Subsidiary listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules
(other than any such Purchased Subsidiary that is not characterized as a
foreign corporation for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) (a " _338 Election_
") and, if so, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a copy of IRS Form 8023 and,
in the case of a comparable election under state, local or foreign Law,

such Taxes or Covered Losses arise as a result of Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including the Purchased Companies) entering into any transaction (inclusive
of any internal restructuring and ownership changes) set forth on _Section_ __
_ 6.11_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules within the timeline set forth
therein.

Section 6.12. _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_.

 



112

    

Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated and the Transaction is abandoned pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no
further force and effect, except, subject in all respects to this _Section_ __
_ 8.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ (including, in each case, the limitations
set forth therein), for the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, _Section_ __
_ 5.5_, _Section_ __ _ 5.17_ relating to Purchasers reimbursement and
indemnification obligations, this  _Article_ __ _ VIII_ and _Article_ __ _
X_, and there will be no Liability on the part of Seller or Purchaser to the
other party. Subject in all respects to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 10.14_ (including in each case, the limitations set forth
therein), nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be deemed to release any
party from any Liability for Fraud prior to such valid termination or for an
intentional and willful breach by such party of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement prior to such valid termination.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)_ or _(f)_ , or (ii) by Purchaser or Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(d)_ when Seller was capable of terminating pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)_ or _(f)_ , then Purchaser shall pay Eight Hundred Million Dollars
($800,000,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ ") to Seller (or any designee of
Seller) as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business
Days following such termination), payable by wire transfer of same day funds.

 

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that in the event that Purchaser shall fail to pay
the Termination Fee when due, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller and its
Affiliates for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued
by Seller and/or its Affiliates (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) in connection with any action (including the filing of any lawsuit)
taken to collect payment of such amount, together with interest on such
unpaid amounts at eight percent (8%) per annum (the " _Interest Rate_ "),
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid to the date of actual payment. The parties acknowledge and agree that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be deemed to affect their
respective rights to specific performance under _Section_ __ _ 10.6_,
including Sellers right to specifically enforce Purchasers rights under the
terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 10.6_ in order to specifically enforce this Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements contained in this  _Section_ __
_ 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) any payment of the Termination Fee is not a penalty but is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Seller in the
circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision.

 



113

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.17_, Seller agrees and
acknowledges that, in the event that the Termination Fee is payable, then (i)
Sellers receipt of the Termination Fee pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
8.2_ and any other amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_ and
Sellers right to seek specific performance of this Agreement by Purchaser
prior to termination of this Agreement, as provided for and subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.6_, shall be Sellers sole and
exclusive remedy against Purchasers Related Parties, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, for any loss arising out of this
Agreement, the Guaranty or the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
upon receipt of the Termination Fee by Seller and any other amounts payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_, none of Purchasers Related Parties
shall have any further Liability whatsoever relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, under no
circumstances shall Seller be (x) entitled to collect the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion (or, after the receipt thereof, any portion thereof or
any further funds or amounts) or (y) permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ and
payment of the Termination Fee. Seller further agrees that the maximum
aggregate liability of Purchaser and all of Purchasers Related Parties,
taken as a whole, shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the
Termination Fee, and in no event shall Seller be entitled to recover any money
damages or other losses or damages of any kind, character or description in
excess of such amount, except as expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _
8.2(c)_ (and only to such limited extent), provided that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall limit Purchasers reimbursement
and indemnification obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.17_. In no event
shall Seller seek to recover, or be entitled to recover, monetary damages from
any Related Party of Purchaser, other than Purchaser under this Agreement or
the Guarantor under the Guaranty.

Section 8.3. _Notice of Termination_. In the event of termination by Seller or
Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, written notice of such
termination shall be given by the terminating party to the other party to this
Agreement.

114

    

Section 9.2. _Indemnification by Seller_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ IX_ and except with
respect to indemnification for Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by
_Article_ __ _ VI_), effective as of and after the Closing, Seller shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any
and all Covered Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising out of, relating to or resulting
from (i) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in
this Agreement; (ii) any Retained Liabilities or Excluded Assets; and (iii)
the matters set forth on _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(iii)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Seller shall not be
required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnified
Party against, or reimburse any Purchaser Indemnified Party for, any Taxes
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or Covered Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)(ii)_ to the extent that such Taxes or Covered Losses are reflected,
recorded or included in Working Capital on the Post-Closing Statement and the
Final Purchase Price on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

 

(c) Seller shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless (i) the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any Covered Losses incurred or
suffered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(iii)_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of such Covered Losses exceeds $100,000,000 (the "
_Deductible_ "), after which time Seller shall be obligated for 50% of any
Covered Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(iii)_ in excess of the Deductible.

 

(d) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties right to bring a claim pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(iii)_ shall expire on the date that is ten (10) years
after the Closing Date, but for the avoidance of doubt, if claims have been
made in accordance with this Agreement prior to the foregoing expiration date,
such claims shall survive until their resolution.

 

Section 9.3. _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the provisions of this
_Article_ __ _ IX_ and except with respect to indemnification for Taxes
(which shall be governed exclusively by _Article_ __ _ VI_), effective as of
and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Seller and its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_
_"_ ), from and against any and all Covered Losses incurred or suffered by any
of the Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent arising out of, relating to or
resulting from (i) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement; and (ii) any Assumed Liabilities or Purchased
Assets.

 

Section 9.4. _Procedures_.

 

(a) Other than with respect to the matters listed on _Section_ __ _ 2.7(k)_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedules for which notice hereunder is not
required, a Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties
liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of
any pending or threatened claim or demand that the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to such
right of indemnification (including a pending or threatened claim or demand
asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim

 



115

    

 being a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail (taking
into account the information then available to the Indemnified Party) the
facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or
demand; _provided_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release
the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article_ __ _
IX_ except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced
by such failure (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), it being
agreed that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a covenant or
agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable
survival period specified in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ for such covenant or
agreement.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3_,
the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such
Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim
(at the expense of such Indemnifying Party); _provided_ that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense and control of
such Third Party Claim, if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal Action or (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates; _provided_ , further, that if the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense and control of such Third Party Claim the Indemnifying Party shall
allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense
except that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the fees and expenses of such
separate counsel if representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party by the same counsel would create a conflict of interest. If
the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense and control of any Third
Party Claim pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to assume and control such defense and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified
Party, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense.
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates and Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim, including by furnishing books
and records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense
and control of a Third Party Claim, it shall be authorized to consent to a
settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
Third Party Claim, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any
Indemnified Party;  _provided_ , that such settlement or judgment does not
involve any injunctive or other equitable relief or finding or admission of
any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates and expressly unconditionally releases the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all Liabilities with respect to such
Third Party Claim. No Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to a Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

(c) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable
best efforts to notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days following the
receipt of such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its indemnity
obligation to the Indemnified Party for any Covered Losses with respect to
such claim, provided that any failure to give such notice shall not limit the
Indemnifying Partys rights under this _Article_

 



116

    

  _IX_. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its indemnity obligation for any
Covered Losses with respect to such claim, the parties shall proceed in good
faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through
negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.7_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this _Article_ __ _ IX_ to the contrary,
with respect to any claims for indemnification related to the matters
identified on _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)(iii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have the right at their sole
discretion (but not the obligation) to retain or assume the defense or
control of any response relating to such matters (but the Indemnifying Party
may nonetheless participate in such defense with its own counsel and at its
own expense), including the disclosure, investigation, negotiation,
performance and settlement thereof (provided, that the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall not consent to a settlement or compromise of, or the entry of
any judgment arising from, such matters without the Indemnifying Partys prior
written consent unless such settlement or judgment does not involve any
injunctive or other equitable relief or finding or admission of any violation
of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnifying Party or any of its
Affiliates and expressly unconditionally releases the Indemnifying Party and
its Affiliates from all Liabilities with respect to such matter). If the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties do not assume the defense and control of such
matters, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to control such defense. In
connection with such defense and control, the controlling party shall (i) keep
the non-controlling party reasonably informed relating to the progress of such
defense and control (including providing the noncontrolling party with copies
of all material plans and reports prior to submission to any Governmental
Entity and providing the non-controlling party with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such plans and reports) and otherwise use reasonable
efforts to timely respond to inquiries by the noncontrolling party regarding
the matters; and (ii) provide the noncontrolling party with reasonable advance
notice of any meetings with any Governmental Entity or any other relevant
adverse third party and unless the Governmental Entity or adverse third party
objects, provide the non-controlling party with a reasonable opportunity to
attend such meetings.

Section 9.5. _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge
and agree that, except as set forth in any other Transaction Document and
except with respect to any matter relating to Taxes (which shall be governed
exclusively by _Article_ __ _ VI_), any matter covered by  _Section_ __ _
2.9_, or to any claim for Fraud and without limiting the parties respective
rights to specific performance under _Section_ __ _ 10.6_, following the
Closing, (x) the indemnification provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller with respect to matters specifically
set forth therein and all other matters and (y) and the indemnification
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
of Purchaser with respect to matters specifically set forth therein and the
RandW Insurance Policy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser with
respect to all other matters (including the breach of any representation or
warranty contained herein), in each case of the foregoing clause (x) and (y),
for any Covered Losses and any other losses and Liabilities (including any
Covered Losses and any other losses and Liabilities from claims for breach of
contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and
whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise)
that such party hereto may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to,
as a result of or in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement by any party hereto, or any
failure

 



117

    

 by any party hereto to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement
that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or complied with, under this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in
furtherance thereof, the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive (i) any right
of rescission of this Agreement, and (ii) other than as provided in the
foregoing, any claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct
(including negligence) or otherwise as a result of or in connection with this
Agreement, the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, following the Closing, whether predicated on common law, statute,
strict liability, or otherwise, that in either case (i) or (ii) they may
otherwise have or to which they may become entitled.

 

Section 9.6. _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all Covered Losses
shall be net of any third-party insurance or indemnity, contribution or
similar proceeds that have been recovered by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (it
being agreed that if third-party insurance or indemnification, contribution
or similar proceeds in respect of such facts are recovered by the Indemnified
Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys making of an indemnification
payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification obligation, such
proceeds (net of any expenses incurred to recover such amounts and any
resulting increase in premiums) shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying
Party to the extent of the indemnification payment made), and the Indemnified
Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable
efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance and indemnity, contribution
or similar provisions covering such Covered Loss to the same extent as it
would if such Covered Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. Upon
making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim
pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ IX_, the Indemnifying Party shall
be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the
Indemnified Party may have against any third party insurers and any third
parties that do not have any material ongoing relationship with Purchaser, its
Affiliates or the Business with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights
to the Indemnifying Party upon the written request of the Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 9.7. _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement (including this  _Article_ __ _ IX_),
neither party hereto shall be liable to the other party hereto or its
Affiliates, whether in contract, tort (including negligence and strict
liability) or otherwise, at law or in equity, and " _Covered Losses_ " shall
not include any amounts for (a) any consequential, special, incidental,
indirect or similar damages (including lost profits, diminution of value, or
damages calculated on multiple of earnings or other metrics approaches), in
each case except to the extent reasonably foreseeable or payable to a third
party or (b) any punitive damages except to the extent payable to a third
party.

 

Section 9.8. _Mitigation_. Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to mitigate its respective Covered Losses upon and
after becoming aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Covered Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

ARTICLE X

 

 _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

 

Section 10.1. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, and the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto, the Guaranty,
and the Confidentiality Agreement, along with the Seller Disclosure Schedules
and Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, constitute the entire agreement and
understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings relating to such subject matter. Neither party hereto shall be
liable or bound to the other party in any manner by any representations,
warranties or covenants relating to such subject matter except as
specifically set forth herein and therein.

Section 10.2. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and
obligations hereunder may be assigned or transferred by either party hereto
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other party hereto; _provided_ that (i) the rights and obligations of
Purchaser may be assigned to any of its Affiliates and (ii) the rights (but
not the obligations) of Purchaser may be assigned to the Debt Financing
Sources as collateral security, but no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser
of any of its obligations under this Agreement or enlarge or alter such
obligations. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section_ __ _
10.2_ shall be void. Subject to the two preceding sentences, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. For the avoidance of doubt, any
assignment by Purchaser of its rights to acquire any Purchased Assets
permitted by this  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ shall not impact whether any such
applicable Purchased Assets are acquired directly through asset transfers or
indirectly through the transfer of equity interests in Purchased Companies, in
each case as set forth in this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

Section 10.3.  _Amendments and Waivers_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.13_,
this Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto. By an instrument in writing, Purchaser,
on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand, may waive compliance by the
other with any term or provision of this Agreement that the other party was or
is obligated to comply with or perform. Such waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with such term or provision shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure of
compliance.

 

Section 10.4. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Subject to _Section_ __ _
10.13_, this Agreement, together with the other Transaction Documents and the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto are not intended to confer in or on
behalf of any Person not a party to this Agreement (and their successors and
assigns) any rights, benefits, causes of action or remedies with respect to
the subject matter or any provision hereof.

Section 10.5. _Notices_. All notices and other communications to be given to
any party hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all purposes hereunder if
in writing and delivered by hand, courier or overnight delivery service, or

receipt requested, with appropriate postage prepaid, or when received in the
form of an email transmission (receipt confirmation requested), and shall be

Section 10.6. _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and the remainder of this _Section_ __ _
10.6_, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary
damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform any provision of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions, and accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other

 



120

    

 remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, each party hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by the other party hereto or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches of, and enforce compliance
with, this Agreement, or in the case of Seller, to cure breaches of those
covenants of Purchaser that require Purchaser to use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Financing (including, to the extent required,
Alternative Financing), enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters and
satisfy the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_,
including complying with and performing its covenants and agreements herein,
including the covenants set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ and  _Section_ __ _
5.16_.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 10.6(a)_ or anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, and subject in all respects to this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_, it
is acknowledged and agreed that (i) Seller shall be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically Purchasers obligation to cause all or
any portion of the Equity Financing to be funded or otherwise cause Purchaser
to take action to consummate the Equity Financing or to pay all or any portion
of the Closing Purchase Price, solely in the event that each of the following
conditions has been satisfied: (A) all of the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied at the date
specified to be the Closing Date in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing or require deliveries or are tested at the time
of Closing, provided that such conditions are capable of being satisfied at
the Closing), (B) Purchaser fails to complete the Closing at the date
specified to be the Closing Date in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, (C)
the Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing that has
been obtained in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.16(b)_) has been funded or
will be funded pursuant to the commitments thereto (or, if such Debt Financing
has been funded into escrow, such funds have been or will be released
from escrow) at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing
(provided that Purchaser shall not be required to draw down the Equity
Financing or consummate the Closing if the Debt Financing is not in fact
funded at the Closing) and (D) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Purchaser that, if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and the Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing that has been
obtained in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.16(b)_) are funded, then
Seller will take all such actions in its power to cause the Closing to occur
(and Seller has not revoked, withdrawn or modified such confirmation); and
(ii) in no event shall Seller be entitled to, or permitted to seek, specific
performance directly against any Debt Financing Source; _provided_ that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ shall prevent Seller from seeking and
obtaining specific performance against (x) the Guarantor under the Guaranty
to the extent expressly permitted under, and in accordance with, the terms and
conditions set forth therein and herein or (y) Purchaser to cause Purchaser to
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing (including, to the
extent required, Alternative Financing), including by enforcing its rights
under the Commitment Letters against any Debt Financing Source.

 

(c) The parties further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right
to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _
10.6_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ shall require any party hereto to
institute any Proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any
Proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ prior
to or as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article_ __ _
VIII_ (and/or receipt of any amounts

 



121

    

 due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_), nor shall the commencement of any
legal action or legal proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ or
anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ restrict or limit any
partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Article_ __ _ VIII_, or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement
that may be available then or thereafter. Subject to compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and the remainder of this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_, each of
the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ on the basis that any other party has an
adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any party hereto
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
order or injunction.

(d) If Seller brings an Action for specific performance pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 10.6_, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
Purchaser breached this Agreement in connection with its failure to effect the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement, but such court declines to enforce
specifically the obligations of Purchaser to effect the Closing in accordance
with this Agreement, then, in addition to the right of Seller to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VIII_, Seller shall be entitled to
pursue all applicable remedies at law, including seeking payment of the
Termination Fee and other damages, subject in all cases to _Section_ __ _
8.2_.

 

Section 10.7. _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. Subject to _Section_ __ _
10.13_, this Agreement and its enforcement, and any controversy arising out
of or relating to the making or performance of this Agreement, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to Delawares principles of conflicts of law. In
addition, each of the parties hereto (a) submits to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, in the event that any dispute
(whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of this Agreement or the
Transaction or the other transactions contemplated hereby; (b) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court; (c) agrees that it will not
bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Transaction or the
other transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the Delaware
Court of Chancery; and (d) agrees that it will not seek to assert by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise, that (x) any such Proceeding (i) is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) should be transferred or removed to any
court other than the above-named court or (iii) should be stayed by reason of
the pendency of some other proceeding in any court other than the above-named
court, or (y) this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced
in or by the above-named court. Each party hereto agrees that service of
process upon such party in any such Proceeding shall be effective if notice
is given in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.5_.

Section 10.8. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. SUBJECT TO _SECTION_ __ _ 10.13_, EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY
WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH (INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT FINANCING) OR THE
ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR THE TRANSACTION OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY
TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION

 



122

    

 PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED
INSTRUMENTS (INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT FINANCING). NO PARTY HERETO
WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN
WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN
WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 10.8_. NO
PARTY HERETO HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT
THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 10.8_ WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN
ALL INSTANCES.

Section 10.9. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.10. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument,
and shall become effective when one (1) or more such counterparts have been
signed by each party hereto and delivered (by e-mail or otherwise) to the
other party. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by electronic mail in
"portable document format" (" _pdf_ _"_ _)_ form or by any other electronic
means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a
document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document
bearing the original signatures. This Agreement has been executed in the
English language. If this Agreement is translated into another language, the
English language text shall in any event prevail.

 

Section 10.11. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
whether or not the Closing takes place, and except as set forth otherwise in
this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

 

Section 10.12. _Interpretation; Absence of Presumption_. It is understood and
agreed that the specification of any Dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any
specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure
Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no party hereto shall use the fact of the setting of such
amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy
between the parties hereto as to whether any obligation, item or matter not
described in this Agreement or

 



123

    

 included in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure
Schedules is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Nothing herein
(including the Seller Disclosure Schedules and the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedules) shall be deemed an admission by either party hereto or any of its
Affiliates, in any Proceeding or Action, that such party or any such
Affiliate, or any third party, is or is not in breach or violation of, or
in default in, the performance or observance of any term or provisions of any
Contract. Notwithstanding any materiality or "Material Adverse Effect"
qualifications in any of the representations and warranties of Seller or
Purchaser in this Agreement, for administrative ease, certain items,
information or other matters may be included in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules that are not necessarily
limited to items, information or matters required to be disclosed by this
Agreement to be reflected in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser
Disclosure Schedules, as applicable, considered by Seller to be material to
the Business (including the Purchased Companies) or the financial condition
or results of operations of the Business (including the Purchased Companies)
or considered by Seller or Purchaser to reasonably be expected to have a
Business Material Adverse Effect or a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. Nothing
contained in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedules is intended to broaden the scope of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement. The fact that any item, information or other
matter has been included, referred to or disclosed in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules (i) shall not be construed to
establish, in whole or in part, any standard of the extent disclosure is
required (including any standard of materiality), for purposes of such
schedules; (ii) does not represent a determination by Seller or Purchaser,
as applicable, that such item did not arise in the ordinary course of
business; and (iii) shall not constitute an admission or indication by Seller
or Purchaser, as applicable, that such disclosure is required to be made
pursuant to any of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, (a) words in the singular shall
be held to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender shall be
held to include the other gender as the context requires; (b) references to
the terms Article, Section, paragraph, Exhibit and Schedule are references to
the Articles, Sections, paragraphs, Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement
unless otherwise specified; (c) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby,"
"hereto," and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement,
including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto; (d) references to " _Dollars_ "
or " _$_ " shall mean U.S. dollars, and whenever conversion of values to or
from any currency other than U.S. Dollars for a particular date or period
shall be required, such conversion shall be made using the closing rate
provided by Bloomberg as of 10:00 a.m. Brussels time on the last Business Day
of the calendar month prior to the applicable date or dates; (e) the word "
_including_ " and words of similar import when used in this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents shall mean "including without limitation," unless
otherwise specified; (f) the word "or" means "and/or"; (g) references to
"written" or "in writing" include in electronic form; (h) provisions shall
apply, when appropriate, to successive events and transactions; (i) the
headings contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; (j)
Seller and Purchaser have each participated in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and if an ambiguity
or question of interpretation should arise, this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties
hereto or thereto, as applicable, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or burdening any party by virtue of the authorship of any

 



124

    

 of the provisions in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents; (k)
a reference to any Person includes such Persons successors and permitted
assigns; (l) any reference to " _days_ " means calendar days unless Business
Days are expressly specified; (m) when calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded and if the last day of such period
is not a Business Day, the period shall end on the next succeeding Business
Day; and (n) whenever this Agreement requires any party hereto to take or not
take any actions, such requirement shall be deemed to include a requirement of
such party to cause each of its Subsidiaries to take or not take such action,
as applicable.

 

Section 10.13. _Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Seller and each Seller Related Party, on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries, hereby: (i) agrees that any Action, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving any
Debt Financing Source, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the
Debt Financing or any of the agreements entered into in connection with the
Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
the performance of any services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New
York, New York, so long as such forum is and remains available, and any
appellate court thereof and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and
its property with respect to any such Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such court, and such Action (except to the extent relating to the
interpretation of any provisions in this Agreement (including any provision in
any documentation related to the Debt Financing that expressly specifies that
the interpretation of such provisions shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the law of the State of New York)) shall be governed by the
laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of
law principles that would result in the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction), (ii) agrees not to bring or support any Action of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Debt Financing Source in any way arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder
in any forum other than any federal or state court in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York, (iii) agrees that service of process upon
Seller or its Subsidiaries in any such Action or proceeding shall be effective
if notice is given in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 10.5_, (iv)
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such
court, (v) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law all rights of trial by jury in any Action
brought against the Debt Financing Sources in any way arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder,
(vi) agrees that no Debt Financing Source shall be subject to any special,
consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious
nature, (vii) agrees that no Debt Financing Source will have any liability to
any Seller Related Party (other than Purchaser and its Affiliates) in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise
(provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall affect the
rights of Purchaser against the Debt Financing Sources with respect to the
Debt Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any services
thereunder), and (viii) agrees that the Debt Financing Sources are express
third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions in this
Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements in this _Section_

 



125

    

  _10.13_ and such provisions and the definition of "Debt Financing Sources",
"Debt Financing Sources Related Parties" and "Seller Related Party" (and any
other provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement,
waiver or other modification of such provision would modify the substance of
such Sections) shall not be amended in any way adverse to the Debt Financing
Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources. For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 10.13_, "Debt Financing Sources" includes all
Debt Financing Sources Related Parties.

 

Section 10.14. _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
Proceeding for breach of this Agreement may only be made against, the entities
that are expressly identified herein as parties to this Agreement and none of
the former, current and future Affiliates, directors, officers, managers,
employees, advisors, Representatives, shareholders, members, managers,
partners, successors and assigns of any party hereto or any Affiliate thereof
or any former, current and future Affiliate, director, officer, manager,
employee, advisor, Representative, shareholder, member, manager, partners,
successor and assign of any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Related
Parties_ ") that is not a party hereto shall have any Liability for
any Liabilities of the parties hereto for any Proceeding (whether in tort,
contract or otherwise) for breach of this Agreement or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, none of the
parties hereto shall have any rights of recovery in respect hereof against
any Related Party that is not a party hereto and no personal Liability shall
attach to any Related Party that is not a party hereto through any party
hereto or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by or through a Proceeding (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) by or on behalf of a party hereto against any Related Party that is
not a party hereto, by the enforcement of any judgment, fine or penalty or by
virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law, or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 10.14_,
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ shall be deemed to limit any
