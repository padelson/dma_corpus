set forth in Article VII.  

 SECTION 1.03. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   

 SECTION 1.04. Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws. (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that, at the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is STATS ChipPAC, Inc."   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the By-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-laws.

The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal.   

ARTICLE II   

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   

 SECTION 2.01. Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any party:   

      |   
---|--- 
     | (a) each share of class A common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company ("Company Class A Common Stock") (all shares of
Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time being hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Company Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 2.01(b)) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically,
subject to Section 2.02, into the right to receive 0.87 (the "Exchange
Ratio") Parent ADSs. The Parent ADSs may be evidenced by one or more Parent
ADRs (as defined in  ##### 

   

      |   
---|--- 
     |   Section 9.03(a)) issued in accordance with the Parent Deposit
Agreement (as defined in Section 9.03(a)). The Parent ADSs to be issued upon
conversion of Company Shares pursuant to this Section 2.01(a) and any cash to
be paid in lieu of fractional Parent ADSs as contemplated in Section 2.02(e)
are referred to collectively as "Merger Consideration". Such Parent ADSs and
the underlying Parent Ordinary Shares shall be in the same class and of the
same ranking as currently outstanding Parent ADSs and Parent Ordinary
Shares;  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (b) each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company and
each Company Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Excluded Company Shares")
shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment
or distribution shall be made with respect thereto; and  
  

      |   
---|--- 
     | (c) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Common Stock").  
  

 SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. (i) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of accepting Certificates (as defined below) to be surrendered by holders of Company Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will mail, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a): (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Company Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal.  

 (ii) At the Effective Time, Parent shall issue to and deposit with the Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares converted into the right to receive Parent ADSs in accordance with Section 2.01(a), Parent Ordinary Shares in an amount sufficient to permit the Depositary to issue Parent ADRs representing the number of Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.01(a). Parent shall cause the Depositary to issue, upon the instructions of the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares converted into the right to receive Parent ADSs in accordance with Section 2.01(a), through the Exchange Agent, Parent ADRs representing the number of Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.01(a).   

 (b) Exchange Procedures. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and covering the Company Shares represented by such Certificate, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to the     ##### 

  

instructions to the letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of whole
Parent ADSs (excluding any fractional interest in Parent ADSs) to which such
holder is entitled in respect of such Company Shares pursuant to Section
2.01(a), and (ii) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings) equal to (A) any cash in lieu of fractional interests in
Parent ADSs to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and
(B) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
certificates representing, in the aggregate, the proper number of Parent ADSs
and a check in the amount equal to any cash in lieu of any fractional
interest in Parent ADSs to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) may be issued to a transferee if
the Certificate representing such Company Shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent, properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate
shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Parent ADSs, cash in lieu of any
fractional interest in Parent ADSs to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).  

 (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Parent ADSs represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional interest in Parent ADSs shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws (as defined in Section 3.05(a)), following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of whole Parent ADSs issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional interest in Parent ADSs to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent ADSs, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole Parent ADSs.   

 (d) No Further Rights in Company Shares. All Parent ADSs issued upon conversion of the Company Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or (e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares.   

 (e) No Fractional ADSs. (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional interests in Parent ADSs shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent or a holder of Parent ADRs or Parent ADSs.      ##### 

    

 (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the number of whole Parent Ordinary Shares delivered to the Depositary by Parent pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(ii) over (B) the aggregate number of whole Parent Ordinary Shares represented by the Parent ADSs to be distributed to holders of Company Shares pursuant to Section 2.02(b) (such excess, as issued as Parent ADSs by the Depositary to the Exchange Agent, the "Excess ADSs"). As soon after the Effective Time as practicable, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Company Shares, who, but for the provisions of the Section 2.03(e), would be entitled to fractional interests in Parent ADSs, shall sell the Excess ADSs on the Nasdaq National Market ("Nasdaq"), all in the manner provided in clause (iii) of this Section 2.02(e).   

 (iii) The sale of the Excess ADSs by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on Nasdaq through one or more member firms of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"). Until the gross proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of Company Shares who are entitled to receive such proceeds, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of Company Shares (the "Company Shares Trust"). Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess ADSs. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Company Shares Trust to which each holder of Company Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate gross proceeds comprising the Company Shares Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of Company Shares is entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Company Shares are entitled.   

 (iv) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to the holders of Company Shares in lieu of any fractional interest in Parent ADSs and subject to Section 2.02(i), the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of Company Shares.   

 (f) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent ADSs or Company Class A Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent ADSs, Parent Ordinary Shares or Company Class A Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   

 (g) Termination of Exchanges. Any Parent ADSs issuable or deliverable in respect of Certificates pursuant to this Article II and any cash in lieu of fractional interests in Parent ADSs payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e), plus any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(c), that remains unclaimed by any holders of Certificates six months after the Effective Time shall be held by or on behalf of the Depositary, subject to the instruction of Parent, in an account or accounts in Singapore designated for such purpose and on behalf of such holders of Certificates. Any cash remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates or Company Shares three years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such cash would otherwise escheat to or     ##### 

    

become property of any Governmental Authority or as is otherwise provided
by applicable Law) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent may determine,
free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.  

 (h) No Liability. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any such Company Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   

 (i) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   

 (j) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Parent ADSs, any cash in lieu of fractional interests in Parent ADSs to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).   

 SECTION 2.03. Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ADSs, any cash in lieu of fractional interests in Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ADSs to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).   

 SECTION 2.04. Company Stock Options. (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall issue Substitute Options (as defined below) in accordance with this Section 2.04 to all holders of options to purchase shares of Company Class A Common Stock (the "Company Stock Options") outstanding, whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested, immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company 1999 Stock Purchase and Option Plan and the      ##### 

    

Company 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Company Stock Option
Plans"). Parent shall issue the Substitute Options under the terms of the new
stock option plans to be adopted by Parent at the Parent Shareholders
Meeting (the "New Stock Option Plans") to replace each of the Company Stock
Option Plans. The terms and conditions of the New Stock Option Plans shall be
substantially similar in all material respects with the terms and conditions
of each of the Company Stock Option Plans, provided that the New Stock Option
Plans shall differ from the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Option
Plans to the extent necessary to comply with Singapore Law. The Company shall
use reasonable efforts to take all necessary action, including obtaining
the consent of any holder of Company Stock Options, to implement the
substitution of the Company Stock Options with Substitute Options pursuant to
the terms of the New Stock Option Plans and in accordance with this Section
2.04; provided, however, that any Company Stock Option that is not
substituted with a Substitute Option because the Company Stock Option holder
rejects the Substitute Option shall terminate as of the Effective Time. At
the Effective Time, (a) each Company Stock Option shall be substituted by
Parent with Substitute Options in such manner that Parent (A) is a
corporation "issuing a stock option in a transaction to which Section 424(a)
applies" within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code and the regulations
thereunder or (B), to the extent that Section 424 of the Code does not apply
to any such Company Stock Option, would be such a corporation were Section
424 of the Code to apply to such Company Stock Option, and (b) each
Substitute Option shall entitle its holder to acquire, on substantially the
same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Company Stock Option for
which the Substitute Option was substituted, (A) a number of Parent Ordinary
Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole Parent
Ordinary Share) of (1) the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock
that were issuable upon exercise of the related Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the Option Exchange
Ratio (which shall be the number equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio
multiplied by 10), and (B) the per share exercise price of each Substitute
Option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest cent)
arrived at by dividing (1) the per share exercise price of each related
Company Stock Option by (2) the Option Exchange Ratio (each, a "Substitute
Option"); provided, however, that, upon exercise of a Substitute Option, the
holder thereof shall have the right to elect to receive Parent ADSs rather
than Parent Ordinary Shares and, upon such election, the holder shall receive
a number of Parent ADSs equal to the number of Parent Ordinary Shares subject
to the Substitute Option divided by ten (rounded down to the nearest whole
Parent ADS).  

 (b) Subject to the approval of the shareholders of Parent, Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to make available for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Substitute Options granted in accordance with this Section 2.04.   

 (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute Option an appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto. Parent shall ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, the Company Stock Option Plans, that Company Stock Options that qualified as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time shall be substituted by Substitute Options that qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code after the Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Parent Ordinary Shares subject to Substitute Options shall be covered by an effective registration      ##### 

    

statement on Form S-8 and Form F-6 (or any successor form) or another
appropriate form, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements for so long as Substitute Options remain outstanding. In addition,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Ordinary Shares
subject to the Substitute Options or underlying any Parent ADSs to be issued
upon exercise of the Substitute Options to be listed on the Singapore
Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the "SGX-ST"), and to cause any Parent
ADSs to be issued upon exercise of the Substitute Options to be quoted on
Nasdaq.  

 (d) On or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall take all necessary action such that, with respect to each member of the Company Board and each employee of the Company that is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the acquisition by such person of Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent ADSs or Substitute Options in the Merger and the disposition by any such person of Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent ADSs or Company Stock Options pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be exempt from the short-swing profit liability rules of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder.   

 SECTION 2.05. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. With respect to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan"), the purchase period currently in progress shall be shortened by setting a new purchase date in accordance with paragraph 2 of Section 18 of the Purchase Plan (the "New Purchase Date"). The Purchase Plan shall terminate immediately following the purchase of shares of Company Class A Common Stock on the New Purchase Date.   

 SECTION 2.06. No Appraisal Rights. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Company Class A Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or equivalent organizational documents, except where such violations could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of any of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement and could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Subject to the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders, the Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Company Class A Common Stock, if and to the extent required by applicable law, and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL).

 SECTION 3.06. Permits; Compliance. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority necessary for each of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the "Company Permits"), except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Company Permits could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of any of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement and could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Company Permits could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of any of the Transactions or      #####

Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (b) any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, Company Permit, franchise or
other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any property
or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound, except for any
such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that could not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or materially delay
consummation of any of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially
delay the Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement and
could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 (c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2003, including the notes thereto, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with past practice since September 30, 2003 which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.     #####

There are no Tax liens upon any property or assets of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries except liens for current Taxes not yet due. To the knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (determined without the application of Section 367 of the Code) or the exchange by Eligible Company Stockholders of Company Shares for Parent ADSs pursuant to the Merger from satisfying the requirements of Section 1.367(a)-3(c) of the Regulations other than subsection (3)(C) thereof.

under any Environmental Law;  
     
     | (c) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has stored,

compliance with, such permits, licenses and other authorizations;  
     
     | (e) neither the execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions will require any investigation, remediation
or other action with respect to Hazardous Substances, or any notice to or
consent of Governmental Authorities or third parties, pursuant to any
applicable Environmental Law;  
     
     | (f) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has
designed, manufactured, installed, marketed, sold, handled or distributed

to the receipt of a proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction under
applicable Law or Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 or that the Company Board determines to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders will not
constitute a violation of this Agreement, provided that such disclosure
states that no action will be taken by the Company Board in violation of this
Section 6.04(c). The obligation of the Company to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be limited or

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the approval of the Share Issuance, the Parent Name Change, the New Stock Option Plans Adoption and the Parent Board Appointments at the Parent Shareholders Meeting, the Parent Board determines, in its good faith judgment prior to the Effective Time and after consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be Parents regularly engaged independent legal counsel), that to make a Change in the Parent Board Recommendation is required to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Parent and its shareholders under applicable Law, the Parent Board may recommend a Superior Proposal, but only (i) after providing written notice to the Company (a "Notice of Parent Superior Proposal") advising the Company that the Parent Board has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal and indicating that the Parent Board intends to effect a Change in the Parent Board Recommendation and the manner in which it intends (or may intend) to do so, and (ii) if the Company does not, within 48 hours of the Companys receipt of the Notice of Parent Superior Proposal, deliver to Parent a binding written offer that the Parent Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after having consulted with independent legal counsel and a financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation) to be at least as favorable to Parents shareholders as such Superior Proposal. Any disclosure that the Parent Board may be compelled to make with respect to the receipt of a proposal or offer for a Competing Transaction under applicable Law (including, without limitation, the Singapore Code of Take-overs and Mergers) or Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 or the requirements of the Securities Industry Counsel or that the Parent Board determines to comply with its fiduciary duties to Parent and its shareholders will not constitute a violation of this Agreement, provided that such disclosure      ##### 

    

states that no action will be taken by the Parent Board in violation of this
Section 6.04(d). The obligation of Parent to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Parent Shareholders Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of

Recommendation, except in the event that this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 8.01(k). Parent shall not submit to the vote of
its shareholders any Competing Transaction, or propose to do so, except in

 SECTION 6.05. Employee Benefits Matters. (a) For one year following the Effective Time, or such longer period as may be required by applicable Law or contract, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide or cause to be provided to employees of the Surviving Corporation or any other affiliate of Parent who were employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in each case, to the extent an employee continues employment with the Surviving Corporation or any other affiliate of Parent (the "Continuing Employees") compensation and employee benefit plans, programs and policies and fringe benefits (other than equity based compensation arrangements) that, in the aggregate, are substantially similar to those that were provided to the Continuing Employees by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement.     ##### 

    

 (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize (or cause to be recognized) the service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or any Company Subsidiary determined as of the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their affiliates that employs any Continuing Employee; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. Each such employee benefit plan, program or arrangement that provides health benefits to Continuing Employees shall waive pre-existing condition limitations with respect to the Continuing Employees to the same extent waived under the applicable group health plan of the Company or any Company Subsidiary maintained prior to the Effective Time, and each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for amounts paid under the corresponding group health plan of the Company or any Company Subsidiary during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums for such plan year.

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect, for six years from the Effective Time, the current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided,      ##### 

    

however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend pursuant to this Section 6.06(b) more than an amount per year equal to
200% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (which
premiums the Company represents and warrants to be $842,575 in
the aggregate), it being understood that, if the premium required to be paid
by Parent for such policy would exceed such 200% amount, then the coverage of
such policy shall be reduced to the maximum amount that may be obtained for

in any manner that would not be commercially reasonable. In case, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors
of each party to this Agreement shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take all such action.  

 SECTION 6.10. Plan of Reorganization.

Following the Effective Time, neither the Surviving Corporation, Parent nor any of their affiliates shall knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (including the failure to receive and maintain the continued effectiveness of the Private Letter Ruling) or the exchange by Eligible Company Stockholders of Company Shares for Parent ADSs pursuant to the Merger from satisfying the requirements of Section 1.367(a)-3(c) of the Regulations other than subsection (3)(C) thereof.   

 (b) As of the date hereof, the Company, after consultation with counsel, does not know of any reason (i) why it would not be able to deliver to counsel to the Company and Parent, at the date of the legal opinions referred to below, certificates, with customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable such firms to deliver legal opinions that (assuming receipt of the Private Letter Ruling) the Merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the Company hereby agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to deliver such certificates effective as of the date of such opinions or (ii) why counsel to the Company and Parent would not be able to deliver legal opinions that (assuming receipt of the Private Letter Ruling) the Merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   

 (c) As of the date hereof, Parent, after consultation with counsel, does not know of any reason (i) why it and Merger Sub would not be able to deliver to counsel to the Company and Parent, at the date of the legal opinions referred to below, certificates, with customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable such firms to deliver legal opinions that (assuming receipt of the Private Letter Ruling) the Merger qualifies as a reorganization     ##### 

    

within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and Parent hereby agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to deliver such certificates on behalf
of both Parent and Merger Sub effective as of the date of such opinions, or
(ii) why counsel to the Company and Parent would not be able to deliver
legal opinions that (assuming receipt of the Private Letter Ruling) the
Merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.  

 (d) Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain a private letter ruling from the IRS with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as provided for under Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(9) of the Regulations, to qualify for an exception to the general rule under Section 367(a)(1) of the Code (the "Private Letter Ruling").

 SECTION 9.04. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   

 SECTION 9.05. Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement, together with the schedules and exhibits thereto, the Voting Agreements, the Employment Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede, except as set forth in Sections 6.03(b), all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder.     ##### 

    

 SECTION 9.06. Parties in Interest; Third Parties. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and, subject to Section 9.05, their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Except to the extent set forth in Sections 9.05 and 9.06, no person who is not a party to this Agreement has any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act, Chapter 53B of Singapore to enforce any provision of this Agreement.   

 SECTION 9.07. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.   

 SECTION 9.08. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State (other than those provisions set forth herein that are required to be governed by the laws of Singapore). All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware Chancery Court or any Delaware federal court. The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Chancery Court or any Delaware federal court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.   

 SECTION 9.09. Headings. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   

 SECTION 9.10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.   

 SECTION 9.11. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO      #####
