applicable, relating to the DENTSPLY Shareholders Meeting and the Sirona Shareholders Meeting and (ii) DENTSPLY and Sirona shall
prepare and DENTSPLY shall file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus,

required by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of DENTSPLY and the shareholders of Sirona. Each party shall notify the other
party promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, and of the issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification
of the shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. In addition,
each party agrees to provide the other party and their respective counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform
the other party of any oral comments, that such party or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with

thereto. Each party and their respective counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and

competition Governmental Entity, including taking all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every legal impediment under
any applicable state, federal, foreign or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Law that may be asserted
by any antitrust or competition Governmental Entity so as to enable the parties hereto to close the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date, including proposing, negotiating, accepting, committing to

and other remedies in order to obtain such approvals and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other Law in any suit or other action, arbitration, or litigation, which could otherwise have the
effect of delaying beyond the Outside Date or preventing the consummation of any of the Transactions. In addition, Sirona and DENTSPLY

competition, fair trade or similar Law in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or other Law that could prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the Closing from
occurring; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, for the avoidance of doubt, such litigation shall in no way limit the obligations
of the parties to comply with their obligations under the terms of this <U>Section 5.6</U>. Sirona and DENTSPLY shall jointly direct
and control any such litigation with counsel of their own choosing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, neither Sirona nor DENTSPLY nor any of their respective Subsidiaries and affiliates shall be required to agree to any
sale, transfer, license, separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any prohibition of or any limitation on the
acquisition, ownership, operation, effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other modification of rights in
respect of, any material assets or businesses, or otherwise modify any material business practice or contractual relationship (each,
a &ldquo;<U>Divestiture</U>&rdquo;). In the event of any conflict between subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this <U>Section 5.6</U>,
the provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;5.6(c)</U> shall, with respect to the matters addressed in this <U>Section 5.6(c)</U>, supersede
the provisions of subsection (a) and (b) of this <U>Section 5.6</U>.</P>
