(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into

conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereupon the separate existence of

(and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to
the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all applicable conditions set
forth in _Article 6 _(except for any conditions that by their nature can
only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such
conditions or waiver by the party entitled to waive such conditions) or at
such other time and place as DENTSPLY and Sirona shall agree. The date and
time at which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_."

  



  

1.3 _Effective Time_.

certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_
") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL.

  



  

(b) The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of
Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or such later time as Sirona and DENTSPLY shall agree and specify in
the Certificate of Merger (such time as the Merger becomes effective being
the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

1.4 _Charters and Bylaws_.

  



  

(a) _Surviving Corporation Certificate of Incorporation and

executive officer of Sirona immediately prior to the Effective Time and one
of DENTSPLY director designees shall be the chief executive officer of

minimum requirements to serve on Sirona's audit committee under the NASDAQ

ARTICLE 2 
 Conversion of Securities IN THE MERGER

  



  

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock of Sirona and Merger Sub_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
DENTSPLY, Sirona, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of Sirona common
stock, $0.01 par value per share (" _Sirona Common Stock_ "):

  



  

(a) All shares of Sirona Common Stock that are owned by DENTSPLY,
Sirona or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 2.1(a)_ , _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.6_ ,
each share of Sirona Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and thereafter represent the right
to receive that number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
shares of DENTSPLY common stock, $0.01 par value per share (" _DENTSPLY Common
Stock_ "), equal to the Exchange Ratio. The shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock
to be issued upon the conversion of shares of Sirona Common Stock pursuant to
this _Section 2.1_ are referred to collectively as the " _Merger
Consideration_." For purposes of this Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ " means
1.8142.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) All of the shares of Sirona Common Stock shall be converted into
shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ and shall
cease to be outstanding and shall cease to exist and, as of the Effective
Time, each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Sirona
Common Stock (a " _Sirona Certificate_ ") or shares of Sirona Common Stock
held in book entry form (" _Sirona Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, in accordance
with _Section 2.1(b)_, the Merger Consideration, upon surrender of such
Sirona Certificate or Sirona Book-Entry Share.

  



  

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

2.2 _Effect on DENTSPLY Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
share of DENTSPLY Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain outstanding. Immediately following the
Effective Time, shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock owned by Surviving
Corporation or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Surviving Corporation shall be
surrendered to DENTSPLY without payment therefor.

  



  

2.3 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock or Sirona
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or
stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Merger Consideration and the Exchange Ratio and any
other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably
adjusted to provide the holders of Sirona Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

2.4 _Fractional Shares_.

  



  

(a) No fractional shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock shall be issued in
the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Sirona Common Stock otherwise
entitled to a fractional share of DENTSPLY Common Stock will be entitled to
receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 2.4_ , a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share of DENTSPLY
Common Stock representing such holder's proportionate interest, if any, in
the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the
Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more transactions of
shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate
number of shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock to be delivered to the Exchange
Agent by DENTSPLY pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(i)_ over (B) the aggregate
number of whole shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock to be distributed to the
holders of shares of Sirona Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.5(b)_ (such
excess, the " _Excess Shares_ "). Sirona, DENTSPLY and the Merger Sub
acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to DENTSPLY that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock. As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of Sirona Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares
of DENTSPLY Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing
prices on the NASDAQ in the manner provided in the following paragraph.

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as agent
for the holders of Sirona Common Stock that would otherwise receive
fractional shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock, shall be executed on the NASDAQ
and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the
proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of Sirona
Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for the
holders of Sirona Common Stock that would otherwise receive fractional shares
of DENTSPLY Common Stock (the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent
shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder
of Sirona Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of
the aggregate proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such holder of Sirona Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to
which all holders of Sirona Common Stock would otherwise be entitled (the "
_Fractional Shares Cash Amount_ ").

  



  

(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Sirona Common Stock in lieu of any
fractional shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of shares of Sirona Common Stock
without interest, subject to and in accordance with _Section 2.5_.

  



  

2.5 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement to the
shareholders of Sirona and the shareholders of DENTSPLY, DENTSPLY
shall appoint a nationally recognized financial institution reasonably
acceptable to Sirona to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the
Effective Time, DENTSPLY shall deposit, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Sirona Common Stock, with the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this _Article 2_, (i) a number of shares of DENTSPLY Common
Stock equal to the total shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments of any dividends or
other distributions declared or made prior to the Effective Time with a
record date after the Effective Time to such holders (collectively, together
with the Fractional Shares Cash Amount, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the whole
shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ and the Fractional Shares Cash Amount out of the Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3) Business Days
thereafter), DENTSPLY shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Sirona Certificate or Sirona Book-Entry Share, in each case
which shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Sirona Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Sirona Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall otherwise be in such
form and have such other provisions as DENTSPLY, Sirona and the Exchange Agent
may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of
the Sirona Certificates or Sirona Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, as applicable, and the method of payment of such holder\'s
Fractional Shares Cash Amount. Upon surrender of Sirona Certificates
and Sirona Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Sirona and DENTSPLY, and
upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form
with all required enclosures and attachments, with respect to such Sirona
Certificates or Sirona Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Sirona
Certificates or Sirona Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the
whole shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash
Amount for each share of Sirona Common Stock formerly represented by such
Sirona Certificates and for each Sirona Book-Entry Share. Any Sirona
Certificates and Sirona Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Sirona Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent to payment that the Sirona
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
delivery of the Merger Consideration, as applicable, to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Sirona Certificate so surrendered and shall have
established to the satisfaction of Sirona that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not required to be paid. Delivery of the Merger Consideration with
respect to Sirona Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Sirona Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Sirona Certificate or Sirona Book-Entry Share shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of Sirona shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Sirona Common Stock on the records of
Sirona. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Sirona Certificates
and Sirona Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Sirona Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Sirona Certificates
representing shares of Sirona Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
whole shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and, if applicable, the Fractional Shares Cash
Amount as provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property_. At any time
following six months after the Closing Date, DENTSPLY shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of DENTSPLY Common
Stock or cash remaining in the Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange
Agent and not delivered to holders of Sirona Certificates or Sirona Book-Entry
Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to
DENTSPLY (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only
as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Sirona Certificates or Sirona Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section 2.5_. If, prior to six
years after the Closing Date (or otherwise immediately prior to such time on
which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws), any holder of Sirona Certificates or Sirona Book-
Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in _Section 2.5_ to
receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled, the Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled in respect of such Sirona Certificates or Sirona Book-Entry Shares
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
DENTSPLY, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of DENTSPLY, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any Representative or
affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any holder of a Sirona Certificate or
Sirona Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

  



  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Sirona Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Sirona
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.1(b)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that DENTSPLY or the Exchange
Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of the Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Sirona Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
DENTSPLY, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Sirona Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

(f) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged DENTSPLY Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to DENTSPLY Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Sirona
Certificate or Sirona Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of DENTSPLY
Common Stock represented thereby, and, if applicable, no portion of the
Fractional Shares Cash Amount shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
_Section 2.4_, unless and until the holder of such Sirona Certificate or
Sirona Book-Entry Share shall surrender such Sirona Certificate or
Sirona Book-Entry Share. Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Sirona Certificate, there
shall be paid by DENTSPLY to the holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) promptly, the portion of the Fractional Shares Cash Amount, if
applicable, payable with respect to a fractional share of DENTSPLY Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4_ and
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of DENTSPLY
Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with
respect to such whole shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock.

2.6 _Sirona Stock Options and Stock-Based Awards_.

  



  

(a) _Treatment of Sirona Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time,
each option to acquire shares of Sirona Common Stock (a " _Sirona Stock
Option_ ") granted under the Sirona Stock Plans that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by DENTSPLY and shall be converted
into an option (a " _DENTSPLY Stock Option_ ") to acquire shares of DENTSPLY
Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.6_. Each such DENTSPLY Stock
Option as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Sirona Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any
changes thereto provided for in the applicable Sirona Stock Plan, in any
award agreement or in such Sirona Stock Option by reason of this Agreement or
the Transactions). As of the Effective Time, each such DENTSPLY Stock Option
as so assumed and converted shall be an option to acquire that number of
whole shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Sirona Common
Stock subject to such Sirona Stock Option and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an
exercise price per share of DENTSPLY Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the exercise price
per share of Sirona Common Stock of such Sirona Stock Option by (y) the
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that the exercise price and the number of shares
of DENTSPLY Common Stock subject to the DENTSPLY Stock Option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code, and, in the case of Sirona Stock Options that are intended to
qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code, consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code.

  



  

(b) _Treatment of Sirona Restricted Stock Units_. As of the
Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award granted under the applicable
Sirona Stock Plan (a " _Sirona RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and that is not vested by its terms as of the Effective
Time shall be assumed by DENTSPLY and shall be converted into a restricted
stock unit award (a " _DENTSPLY RSU_ ") to acquire DENTSPLY Common Stock in
accordance with this _Section 2.6_. Each such DENTSPLY RSU as so assumed and
converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the Sirona RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in the
applicable Sirona Stock Plan, in any award agreement or in such Sirona RSU by
reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). As of the Effective Time, each
such DENTSPLY RSU as so assumed and converted shall be a restricted stock unit
award for that number of shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Sirona Common Stock underlying such Sirona RSU multiplied by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio. As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award
granted under the applicable Sirona Stock Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that vests as of the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms shall be canceled as of the
Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Sirona Common Stock subject
thereto as of immediately before the Effective Time.

(c) Not later than the Closing Date, DENTSPLY shall deliver to the
holders of Sirona Stock Options and Sirona RSUs any required notices setting
forth such holders' rights pursuant to the relevant Sirona Stock Plan and
award documents and stating that such Sirona Stock Options or Sirona RSUs
have been assumed by DENTSPLY and shall continue in effect on the same terms
and conditions subject, in each case, to the adjustments required by this
_Section 2.6_ after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of
the relevant Sirona Stock Plan.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Sirona shall take all necessary
action for the adjustment of Sirona Stock Options and Sirona RSUs under this
_Section 2.6_. DENTSPLY shall reserve for future issuance a number of shares
of DENTSPLY Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of DENTSPLY
Common Stock that will be subject to DENTSPLY Stock Options and DENTSPLY RSUs
as a result of the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.6_. Not later
than the Closing Date, DENTSPLY shall file an effective
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to
the DENTSPLY Common Stock subject to such DENTSPLY Stock Options and DENTSPLY
RSUs and shall distribute a prospectus relating to such Form S-8, and DENTSPLY
shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such DENTSPLY Stock Options and DENTSPLY RSUs remain outstanding.

  



  

(e) Immediately after the Effective Time, Sirona shall take all
necessary actions necessary to terminate the Sirona Stock Plans, and no
additional equity-based awards shall be issued thereunder.

  



  

2.7 _Withholding Rights_. Each of DENTSPLY, the Surviving
Corporation, Sirona, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of a Sirona Certificate or Sirona Book-Entry Share or
any other Person who is entitled to receive the Merger Consideration or
Fractional Shares Cash Amount, such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld under the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code
or any provisions of applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person(s) in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

ARTICLE 3 
 Representations and Warranties of Sirona

  



  

Except (a) as set forth in the Sirona Disclosure Schedule (subject to
_Section 8.15_) and (b) as otherwise disclosed or identified in the
Sirona SEC Documents publicly filed or furnished after September 30, 2013 and
prior to the date hereof (other than (i) any forward-looking disclosures
contained in the "Forward Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" sections of
the Sirona SEC Documents and any other disclosures included therein to the
extent they are primarily predictive, cautionary or forward looking in nature
and (ii) information included in, or incorporated by reference as, exhibits
and schedules to any Sirona SEC Document, and provided that the exception
provided for in this clause (b) shall be applied if, and only if, the nature
and content of the applicable disclosure in any such Sirona SEC Document
publicly filed or furnished prior to the date hereof is reasonably
specific as to matters and items such that the subject matter of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of the text of such disclosure
to be applicable to the representation set forth herein), Sirona hereby
represents and warrants to DENTSPLY as follows:

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.1 _Corporate Organization_. Each of Sirona and, except where the
failure to be in good standing has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Sirona Material
Adverse Effect, its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity duly
organized, validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite
corporate or other entity power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Each of Sirona and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Sirona Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the " _Sirona Charter_"), and By-
Laws of Sirona (the " _Sirona Bylaws_ ") as most recently filed with the
Sirona SEC Documents are true, complete and correct copies of such documents
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Sirona is not in violation of
any of the provisions of the Sirona Charter. True and complete copies of all
minute books of Sirona since January 1, 2013 have been made available by
Sirona to DENTSPLY, except for such portions of the minutes subject to
attorney-client privilege or with respect to the consideration of a possible
acquisition or business combination involving Sirona.

  



  

3.2 _Sirona Capitalization_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of Sirona consists of ninety-five
million (95,000,000) shares of Sirona Common Stock and five
million (5,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share ("
_Sirona Preferred Stock_ "). As of September 11, 2015, (i) 55,896,586 shares
of Sirona Common Stock (other than treasury shares) were issued and
outstanding, all of which were validly issued and fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights, (ii) 2,471,499 shares of Sirona Common
Stock were held in the treasury of Sirona or by its Subsidiaries, (iii)
1,480,768 shares of Sirona Common Stock were issuable (and such number was
reserved for issuance) upon exercise of Sirona Stock Options granted under a
Sirona Stock Plan, Sirona RSUs granted under the Sirona Stock Plans and
performance-based stock unit awards (the " _Sirona Performance Units_ ")
granted under a Sirona Stock Plan outstanding as of such date and (iv) no
shares of Sirona Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. Except for
Sirona Stock Options, Sirona RSUs and Sirona Performance Units to purchase not
more than 1,480,768 shares of Sirona Common Stock, there are no options,
warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
character to which Sirona or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
Sirona or any of its Subsidiaries is bound relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock or other Equity Interests of Sirona or any of its
Subsidiaries, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital
stock or other Equity Interests, or obligating Sirona or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock or other Equity
Interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital
stock of, or other Equity Interests in, Sirona or any of its Subsidiaries.
Since September 11, 2015, Sirona has not issued any shares of its
capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such capital stock or other Equity Interests, other than
those shares of capital stock reserved for issuance described in this _Section
3.2(a)_. Sirona has previously provided DENTSPLY with a true and complete
list, as of the date hereof, of the prices at which each outstanding Sirona
Stock Option, Sirona RSU and Sirona Performance Unit may be exercised under
the applicable Sirona Stock Plan, the number of Sirona Stock Options, Sirona
RSUs and Sirona Performance Units outstanding at each such price and the
vesting schedule of the Sirona Stock Options, Sirona RSUs and Sirona
Performance Units. None of the Sirona Stock Options are "incentive stock
options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. All shares of Sirona
Common Stock subject to issuance under a Sirona Stock Plan, upon issuance
prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions specified in the
instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. There
are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Sirona having the
right to vote on any matters on which shareholders of Sirona may vote. Neither
Sirona nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any voting agreement with
respect to the voting of any Equity Interests of Sirona or any of
its Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries (i) restricting the transfer of, (ii) affecting the voting rights
of, (iii) requiring the repurchase, redemption or disposition of, or
containing any right of first refusal with respect to, (iv) requiring the
registration for sale of, or (v) granting any preemptive or antidilutive
right with respect to, any shares of Sirona Common Stock or any capital stock
of, or other Equity Interests in, Sirona or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) _Section 3.2(c)_ of the Sirona Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of all of the Subsidiaries of Sirona and the
jurisdiction of organization of each such Subsidiary. Except as set forth in
_Section 3.2(c)_ of the Sirona Disclosure Schedule, none of Sirona or any of
its Subsidiaries holds an Equity Interest in any other Person. Each
outstanding share of capital stock or other Equity Interest in each
Subsidiary of Sirona is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is owned, beneficially and of
record, by Sirona or one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries free and
clear of all Liens. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of
Sirona or any of its Subsidiaries to provide funds to, or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any
Subsidiary of Sirona (in excess of $5 million) or any other Person, other
than guarantees by Sirona of any indebtedness or other obligations of any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Sirona.

filing of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL and (iv) where
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to

statements, registration statements, prospectuses and other documents
required to be filed or furnished by Sirona with the SEC under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act since October 1, 2012 (the " _Sirona SEC Documents_

filings with the SEC.

  



  

(b) As of its respective filing date, and, if amended, as of the
date of the last amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, each Sirona
SEC Document complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Sirona SEC
Document and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(c) The consolidated financial statements of Sirona included in the
Sirona SEC Documents (including, in each case, any notes or
schedules thereto) and all related compilations, reviews and other reports
issued by Sirona's accountants with respect thereto (the " _Sirona SEC
Financial Statements_ "), comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto. The Sirona SEC Financial Statements fairly
present, in all material respects, the financial condition and the results of
operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity of Sirona (on a
consolidated basis) as of the respective dates of and for the periods referred
to in the Sirona SEC Financial Statements, and were prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto), subject, in the case of interim
Sirona SEC Financial Statements, to normal year-end adjustments (which
are not material in significance or amount) and the absence of notes. The

all material respects, have been maintained in accordance with sound business
practices and accurately present and reflect in all material respects all of

consolidated financial statements of Sirona. Except as required by GAAP,
Sirona has not, between June 30, 2015 and the date of this Agreement, made or

(d) Sirona is in compliance in all material respects with (i) the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder or under the Exchange Act (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ.

  



  

(e) Sirona has made available to DENTSPLY true and complete copies
of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC received
since October 1, 2013 relating to the Sirona SEC Documents and all written
responses of Sirona thereto other than with respect to requests for
confidential treatment or which are otherwise publicly available on the SEC's
EDGAR system. To the Knowledge of Sirona, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to any Sirona SEC Documents and none of the Sirona SEC Documents
(other than confidential treatment requests) is the subject of ongoing SEC
review. There are no internal investigations with respect to which Sirona has
retained outside counsel, SEC inquiries or investigations or other
governmental inquiries or investigations, to the Knowledge of Sirona, pending
or threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of Sirona.

  



  

(f) Sirona has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms
are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and
paragraph (e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Sirona's disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by Sirona in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Sirona's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections
302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Sirona's management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of Sirona's disclosure controls and
procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any
applicable Sirona SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or
any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
such report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on
Sirona's management's most recently completed evaluation of Sirona's internal
control over financial reporting prior to the date hereof, (i) Sirona had no
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
its internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect Sirona's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) Sirona does not have
Knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in Sirona's internal control over
financial reporting.

(g) Sirona and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and

other Transactions, by any employee, officer or director of Sirona or any of

its Subsidiaries to a bonus, severance or change in control payment, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits, increase
the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to any

States of America (a " _Sirona Foreign Benefit Plan_ "): (i) all employer and
employee contributions to each Sirona Foreign Benefit Plan required by law or
by the terms of any Sirona Foreign Benefit Plan have been made or, if

fair market value of the assets of each funded Sirona Foreign Benefit Plan,

Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations with respect to all
current and former participants in such Sirona Foreign Benefit Plan according
to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employer contributions to such Sirona Foreign Benefit Plan, and neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or other
Transactions will cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than
such benefit obligations; and (iii) to the Knowledge of Sirona, each Sirona
Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered and has

the conduct of the business of Sirona and its Subsidiaries in substantially
the same manner as presently conducted and currently proposed to be

any Person to limit, terminate, or consent to the continued use of, any
rights of Sirona or any of its Subsidiaries in any Intellectual Property
except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

filed with the SEC, the Joint Proxy Statement to be sent to the shareholders
of DENTSPLY and the shareholders of Sirona, as applicable, relating to the
DENTSPLY Shareholders Meeting and the Sirona Shareholders Meeting and (ii)
DENTSPLY and Sirona shall prepare and DENTSPLY shall file with the SEC the
Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of
the shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. Each of
DENTSPLY and Sirona shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by
responding to comments of the SEC) and, prior to the effective date of the
Form S-4, each of DENTSPLY and Sirona shall take all action reasonably
required (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process in
any such jurisdiction) to be taken under any applicable securities Laws in
connection with the issuance of Sirona Common Stock. Each of DENTSPLY and
Sirona shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the
other party in connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement. As promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become effective, each of

amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by DENTSPLY, and no
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement will be
made by DENTSPLY or Sirona, in each case without providing the other party
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to DENTSPLY or
Sirona, or any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers, should
be discovered by DENTSPLY or Sirona which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that
either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of DENTSPLY and the shareholders of Sirona.
Each party shall notify the other party promptly of the time when the Form
S-4 has become effective, and of the issuance of any stop order or suspension
of the qualification of the shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. In
addition, each party agrees to provide the other party and their respective
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform the other party
of any oral comments, that such party or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or
oral responses thereto. Each party and their respective counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and each
party shall give due consideration to the additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the other party and their respective counsel.

_provided_ , _however_ , that Sirona may postpone or adjourn the Sirona
Shareholders Meeting (A) with the prior written consent of DENTSPLY; (B) if a

the Sirona Shareholders Meeting; (D) to allow reasonable additional time to
solicit additional proxies, if and to the extent the requisite Sirona
Shareholder Approval would not otherwise be obtained; or (E) if required by
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clauses (B), (C), (D) and
(E), the Sirona Shareholders Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned for
more than ten (10) Business Days in the aggregate from the originally
scheduled date of the Sirona Shareholders Meeting without the prior written
consent of DENTSPLY. Sirona shall, upon the reasonable request of DENTSPLY,

5.4 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

  



  

(a) Each of Sirona and DENTSPLY shall immediately cease, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to immediately cease,
any discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with
respect to a Competing Proposal, or any proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, and shall request to have returned
promptly to Sirona or DENTSPLY, as applicable, any confidential information
that has been provided in any such discussions or negotiations. From the date
hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_, each of Sirona and DENTSPLY
shall not, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or
induce (including by way of furnishing information which has not been
previously publicly disseminated), or take any other action designed to
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal which constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Proposal, or (ii)
engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) such party may ascertain facts from the
Person making an unsolicited Competing Proposal for the sole purpose of the
Sirona Board or the DENTSPLY Board, as applicable, informing itself about the
terms of such Competing Proposal and the Person that made it and (y) if, prior
to obtaining the Sirona Shareholder Approval (in the case of Sirona) or the
DENTSPLY Shareholder Approval (in the case of DENTSPLY) and following the
receipt of a bona fide written Competing Proposal made after the date hereof
that the Sirona Board or DENTSPLY Board, as applicable, determines in good
faith (after receiving advice of its financial advisor and of its outside
legal counsel) is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and that was not, directly or indirectly, solicited, initiated or
knowingly encouraged in violation of this _Section 5.4_ , the Sirona Board or
the DENTSPLY Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to take action with
respect to such Competing Proposal, as applicable, would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to Sirona's shareholders or DENTSPLY's shareholders, as
applicable, under applicable Law, Sirona or DENTSPLY may, in response to such
Competing Proposal, as applicable, and subject to compliance with _Section
5.4(c)_, (A) furnish information with respect to Sirona or DENTSPLY, as
applicable, to the Person making such Competing Proposal pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) engage in discussions
or negotiations with such Person regarding such Competing Proposal. Except as
expressly permitted by this _Section _ _5.4_ , each of DENTSPLY and Sirona
shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives
not to, from and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Article_ _7_ , directly or indirectly (1) approve, endorse,
recommend or enter into, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, recommend
or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive
agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect
to any Competing Proposal; (2) take any action to make the provisions of any
takeover statute inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a Competing
Proposal; or (3) terminate, amend, release, modify or knowingly fail to
enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under,
any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by the
applicable party in respect of or in contemplation of a Competing Proposal
(other than to the extent the DENTSPLY Board or the Sirona Board, as
applicable, determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take any of such actions under clause (3) would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law), or (4)
propose to do any of the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this _Section_ _5.4(a)_ shall relieve any party from its obligations under
_Section 5.6_.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including
_Section 5.3_ but subject to compliance with this _Section 5.4_, prior to
receipt of the Sirona Shareholder Approval, the Sirona Board may, or, prior to
receipt of the DENTSPLY Shareholder Approval, the DENTSPLY Board may, in
response to any bona fide written Competing Proposal that was not, directly or
indirectly, solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged in violation of this
_Section 5.4_ , effect a Sirona Adverse Recommendation Change or a
DENTSPLY Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, if and only if (i) the
Sirona Board or the DENTSPLY Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith,
after consultation with Sirona's or DENTSPLY's outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (ii) the DENTSPLY Board or the Sirona Board, as applicable,
provides the other party five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action (a " _Competing Proposal Notice_ "), which
notice shall include the information with respect to such Competing Proposal
that is specified in _Section 5.4(c)_, as well as a copy of such Competing
Proposal (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by a party
nor any public announcement thereof that such party determines it is required
to make under applicable Law shall constitute a Sirona Adverse
Recommendation Change or a DENTSPLY Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable, unless and until such party shall have failed at or prior to the
end of the period referred to in clause (iii) below (and, upon the occurrence
of such failure, such notice and such public announcement shall constitute a
Sirona Adverse Recommendation Change or a DENTSPLY Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable) to publicly announce that it (A) is recommending the
Transactions and (B) has determined that such other Competing
Proposal (taking into account (x) any modifications or adjustments made to
the Transactions agreed to by the other party in writing and (y) any
modifications or adjustments made to such other Competing Proposal) is not a
Superior Proposal and has publicly rejected such Competing Proposal); (iii)
during the five (5) Business Days following such written notice (the "
_Negotiation Period_ "), if requested by the other party, the Board of
Directors effecting the recommendation change and its Representatives have
negotiated in good faith with the other party regarding any revisions to the
terms of the Transactions proposed by the other party in response to such
Competing Proposal; and (iv) at the end of the five (5) Business Day period
described in the foregoing clause (iii), the Sirona Board or DENTSPLY Board,
as applicable, concludes in good faith, after consultation with Sirona's or
DENTSPLY's outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into
account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement to
which the other party has agreed in writing to make to the terms of the
Transactions), that the Competing Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal and, after consultation with Sirona's or DENTSPLY's outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Sirona Adverse Recommendation Change or
DENTSPLY Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, would be inconsistent
with the exercise by the Sirona Board or DENTSPLY Board of its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of Sirona or shareholders of DENTSPLY under
applicable Law. Any material amendment or modification to any Competing
Proposal shall require a new Competing Proposal Notice and the Negotiation
Period shall be extended by an additional three (3) Business Days from the
date of receipt of such new Competing Proposal Notice.

(c) In addition to the obligations of DENTSPLY and Sirona set forth
in _Section 5.4(a)_ and _Section 5.4(b)_, DENTSPLY or Sirona shall
promptly, and in any event no later than 24 hours, after it receives (i) any
Competing Proposal or indication by any Person that is considering making a
Competing Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to
DENTSPLY or Sirona or their respective Subsidiaries other than requests for
information in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and unrelated to a Competing Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for
discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal, notify the
other party orally and in writing of any of the foregoing occurrences, the
identity of the person making such request, inquiry or Competing Proposal and
a copy of such request, inquiry or Competing Proposal (or where no such copy
is available, a reasonably detailed description of such request, inquiry or
Competing Proposal), including any modifications thereto. Each party shall
keep the other party reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on a current
basis (and in any event at the other party's request and otherwise no later
than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material changes,
developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any request,
inquiry or Competing Proposal (including the terms and conditions thereof and
of any modification thereto), and any material developments, discussions and
negotiations, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, material
correspondence and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material
oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify the other party
orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Competing
Proposal pursuant to _Section 5.4_. Each of DENTSPLY and Sirona agrees that,
subject to applicable restrictions under applicable Law, it shall, prior to
or concurrent with the time it is provided to any third parties, provide to
the other party any non-public information concerning DENTSPLY or Sirona and
their respective Subsidiaries that DENTSPLY or Sirona provided to any third
party in connection with any Competing Proposal which was not previously
provided to the other party.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_ to the contrary,
at any time prior to obtaining the DENTSPLY Shareholder Approval or the
Sirona Shareholder Approval, the DENTSPLY Board or the Sirona Board may make
a DENTSPLY Adverse Recommendation Change or a Sirona Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable, if (i) such board determines that an Intervening Event
has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make a DENTSPLY
Adverse Recommendation Change or a Sirona Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable, in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the applicable party's shareholders under applicable
Law; _provided_ that (x) the DENTSPLY Board or the Sirona Board has given the
other party at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the
circumstances related to such determination and (y) prior to effecting a
DENTSPLY Adverse Recommendation Change or a Sirona Adverse Recommendation
Change, the applicable party has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with the other party during such
notice period to the extent such other party wishes to negotiate, to enable
such party to revise the terms of this Agreement, such that the failure to
make a DENTSPLY Adverse Recommendation Change or a Sirona Adverse
Recommendation Change, as applicable, would not be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to shareholders under applicable Law.

  



    

 | 70| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the DENTSPLY
Board or the Sirona Board from (i) taking and disclosing to
their shareholders, as applicable, a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
(ii) making any disclosure to their shareholders, as applicable, if the
Sirona Board or DENTSPLY Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with its duties to shareholders under, or would violate,
applicable Law; or (iii) making accurate disclosure to their shareholders, as
applicable, of factual information regarding the business, financial
condition or results of operations of DENTSPLY or Sirona or the fact that a
Competing Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such
proposal or the material terms of such proposal (and such disclosure
shall not be deemed to be a DENTSPLY Adverse Recommendation Change or a
Sirona Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable), so long as (A) any such
disclosure includes the DENTSPLY Recommendation or the Sirona Recommendation,
as applicable, without any modification or qualification thereof and
continues the prior recommendation of the DENTSPLY Board or Sirona Board, as
the case may be, and (B) does not contain either an express DENTSPLY Adverse
Recommendation Change (without giving effect to clause (y) of the definition
thereof) or an express Sirona Adverse Recommendation Change (without giving
effect to clause (y) of the definition thereof), as applicable, or any other
statements by or on behalf of the Board of Directors of such party which would
reasonably be expected to have the same effect as a DENTSPLY Adverse
Recommendation Change or a Sirona Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable.

  



  

(f) Any failure of DENTSPLY's or Sirona's respective Subsidiaries or
its and their respective Representatives to fully comply with this _Section
5.4_ (as if such Subsidiaries or Representatives were directly subject to this
_Section 5.4_ ) shall be deemed a breach of this _Section 5.4_ by DENTSPLY or
Sirona, as applicable.

  



  

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

(i) " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the
Transactions, any proposal or offer from a third party relating to (A) a
merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, joint

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any material event, development or
change in circumstances that first occurs, arises or becomes known
to DENTSPLY or Sirona or its respective board after the date of this
Agreement, to the extent that such event, development or change in
circumstances was not reasonably foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement
(or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability of magnitude of
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable); provided,
however, that in no event shall the following events, developments or changes
in circumstances constitute an Intervening Event: (1) the receipt, existence
or terms of a Competing Proposal or any matter relating thereto or
consequence thereof; (2) any change in the price, or change in
trading volume, of DENTSPLY Common Stock or Sirona Common Stock ( _provided_
, _however_ , that the exception to this clause (2) shall not apply to the
underlying causes giving rise to or contributing to such change or prevent any
of such underlying causes from being taken into account in determining
whether an Intervening Event has occurred); (3) meeting or exceeding
internal or analysts' expectations, projections or results of operations (

DENTSPLY Board or the Sirona Board, as applicable, and after
consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, taking into
account the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
Competing Proposal, including the financing terms thereof, and the third
party making such Competing Proposal (A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to
be consummated, (B) if consummated, would result in a transaction that is more
favorable to DENTSPLY's shareholders or Sirona's shareholders, as applicable,
from a financial point of view, than the Merger and the other Transactions
contemplated hereby (after giving effect to all adjustments or modifications
to the terms thereof which may be agreed in writing to be made by the other
party (including pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)_)) and (C) if a cash transaction
(in whole or in part), financing for which is then fully committed or

breach any agreement with any third party, (y) constitute a waiver of the
attorney-client or other privilege held by such party or (z)
otherwise violate any applicable Law. In the event any of the restrictions in
clauses (x) through (z) of the foregoing sentence shall apply, the parties
shall advise the other party of the subject matter of any such information

(b) In furtherance, and without limiting the generality, of the
foregoing, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
(i) cooperate with and assist each other in good faith to (A) determine, as

federal, state or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
Laws with respect to the Transactions, (B) provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as reasonably practicable to the other party all necessary
information and assistance as any Governmental Entity may from time to time
require of such party in connection with obtaining the relevant waivers,
permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications, Orders or
expiration of waiting periods in relation to such filings or in connection
with any other review or investigation of the Transactions by a Governmental
Entity pursuant to the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable
foreign, federal, state or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade
or similar Laws and (C) provide or cause to be provided as promptly
as reasonably practicable all assistance and cooperation to allow the other
party to prepare and submit any such filings or submissions required to be
submitted under the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable
foreign, federal, state or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade
or similar Laws, including providing to the other party any information that

party shall permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and
shall consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with,
any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, written arguments, opinions,
written proposals or other materials to be submitted to the Governmental
Entities. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each party shall keep the
other apprised of the material content and status of any material
communications with, and material communications from, any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the
other party of any material communication it receives from any Governmental
Entity relating to any review or investigation of the Transactions under the
HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable foreign, federal, state
or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Laws. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties shall, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective affiliates to use
their reasonable best efforts to, provide each other with copies of all
material correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of
their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity
or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement
and the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted
(1) to remove references concerning the valuation of DENTSPLY and its
Subsidiaries or Sirona and its Subsidiaries, as applicable; (2) as necessary
to comply with any Contract or Laws; and (3) as necessary to address

(c) Subject to the penultimate sentence of this _Section 5.6(c)_ ,
Sirona and DENTSPLY shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, take any and all steps necessary to obtain
approval of the consummation of the Transactions by any antitrust
or competition Governmental Entity, including taking all steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every legal impediment under any applicable
state, federal, foreign or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or
similar Law that may be asserted by any antitrust or competition Governmental
Entity so as to enable the parties hereto to close the Transactions as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside
Date, including proposing, negotiating, accepting, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of their Subsidiaries, assets, properties or
businesses, the entrance into, or the amendment, modification or termination
of, any Contracts or other arrangements, and other remedies in order to
obtain such approvals and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Law in any suit or
other action, arbitration, or litigation, which could otherwise have
the effect of delaying beyond the Outside Date or preventing the consummation
of any of the Transactions. In addition, Sirona and DENTSPLY shall, and shall
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, defend through litigation on
the merits so as to enable the parties to close the Transactions as promptly
as reasonably practicable (and in any event prior to the Outside Date) any
claim asserted in court or an administrative or other tribunal by any
antitrust or competition Governmental Entity under applicable
antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Law in order to avoid entry of,
or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) or other Law that could prevent or delay
beyond the Outside Date the Closing from occurring; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, such litigation shall in no way limit the
obligations of the parties to comply with their obligations under the terms
of this _Section 5.6_. Sirona and DENTSPLY shall jointly direct and control
any such litigation with counsel of their own choosing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, neither Sirona nor
DENTSPLY nor any of their respective Subsidiaries and affiliates shall be
required to agree to any sale, transfer, license, separate holding,
divestiture or other disposition of, or to any prohibition of or any
limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation, effective control or
exercise of full rights of ownership, or other modification of rights
in respect of, any material assets or businesses, or otherwise modify any
material business practice or contractual relationship (each, a "
_Divestiture_ "). In the event of any conflict between subsections (a), (b) or
(c) of this _Section 5.6_ , the provisions of this _Section 5.6(c)_ shall,
with respect to the matters addressed in this _Section 5.6(c)_ ,
supersede the provisions of subsection (a) and (b) of this _Section 5.6_.

  



    

 | 75| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Each party shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries
to, respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries
or requests for information and documentary material received from any
Governmental Entity in connection with any antitrust or competition matters
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

5.7 _Certain Notices_. Each party shall give prompt notice to the
other parties if any of the following occur after the date of this
Agreement: (a) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from
any Person alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the Transactions; (b) receipt of any notice or
other communication from any Governmental Entity or the NASDAQ (or any other
securities market) in connection with the Transactions; or (c) such
party becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that could prevent or
delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Transactions or that
would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Merger
set forth in _Article 6_ not being satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall not cure any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice. Sirona and DENTSPLY shall promptly
provide, to the extent not publicly available, the other party with copies of
all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Transactions.

  



  

5.8 _Public Announcements_. Each party agrees that no public
release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by
any party without the prior written consent of DENTSPLY and Sirona (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
to the extent such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law
or the rules or regulations of any applicable securities exchange or
regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is subject, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.
DENTSPLY and Sirona agree that the press release announcing the execution and
delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release in the form heretofore
agreed by the parties. In addition, subject to the right of the DENTSPLY
Board to make a DENTSPLY Adverse Recommendation Change or the Sirona Board to
make a Sirona Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case in accordance with
and subject to the terms and conditions of _Section 5.4_, DENTSPLY and
Sirona agree to cause their respective directors and officers to refrain from
taking any position in any public statement that is (a) contrary to the
positions previously taken by Sirona and DENTSPLY with respect to this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, or (b) reasonably
likely to have a material adverse impact on the ability of the parties hereto
to consummate the Transactions.

5.9 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, DENTSPLY shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
shall advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest extent permitted under (i)
applicable Law, (ii) DENTSPLY's and Sirona's organizational documents in
effect as of the date of this Agreement and (iii) any Contract of DENTSPLY,
Sirona or any of their respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, each present and former director and officer of DENTSPLY,
Sirona and any of their respective Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in
such capacity) (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions.

  



  

(b) DENTSPLY agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification
or advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in
respect of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions)
now existing in favor of an Indemnitee as provided in its certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. For a period of no less than six (6) years from the Effective Time,
DENTSPLY shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the organizational documents of
DENTSPLY, Sirona or any of their respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the
date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were
current or former directors or officers of DENTSPLY, Sirona or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any
Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

  



  

(c) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, DENTSPLY
shall maintain for the benefit of the Indemnitees, a DandO insurance policy
that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Closing Date (the "
_D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not
less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy of Sirona, or,
if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that DENTSPLY shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of
the last annual premium paid by Sirona prior to the date of this Agreement
(it being understood and agreed that, in the event that the requisite
coverage is not available for an annual premium less than or equal to 250% of
such last annual premium, DENTSPLY shall nevertheless be obligated to provide
such coverage as may be obtained for 250% of such last annual premium). The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including in respect of the Transactions.

  



    

 | 77| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) In the event that either DENTSPLY or the Surviving Corporation
or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each case, DENTSPLY shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
cause proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such individual may have under DENTSPLY's, Sirona's or any of their
respective Subsidiaries' organizational documents in effect as of the date of
this Agreement or in any Contract of DENTSPLY, Sirona or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The
obligations of DENTSPLY and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section
5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies
unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees
to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.9_).

  



  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to
or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to DENTSPLY, Sirona or any of their respective Subsidiaries for
any of their respective directors or officers, it being understood and agreed
that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to
or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  



  

5.10 _Financing Matters_. Between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, each of Sirona and DENTSPLY shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
use reasonable best efforts (a) to obtain all necessary waivers, consents,
amendments or approvals with respect to their respective Contracts relating
to indebtedness for borrowed money, to the extent that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement would result in a breach of or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give
rise to any notification or consent requirement or any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, or to loss of a material
benefit under, such Contracts relating to indebtedness for borrowed money, (b)
to refinance, renew or replace the indebtedness under such Contracts on terms
mutually agreeable to Sirona and DENTSPLY, _provided_ that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement would not result in a breach of
or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give
rise to any notification or consent requirement or any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, or to loss of a material
benefit under, any Contract under which such indebtedness is refinanced,
renewed or replaced or (c) to the extent that the waivers, consents,
amendments or approvals contemplated by clause (a) are not obtained and such
indebtedness is not refinanced, renewed or replaced as contemplated by clause
(b), to ensure that sufficient cash is available for the prompt payment in
full of any indebtedness under any such Contract and termination of any such
Contract, in each case at or prior to the Closing Date. In addition, between
the date hereof and the Closing Date, each of Sirona and DENTSPLY shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate to
develop an optimal global financing structure for DENTSPLY and
its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing, and to reasonably cooperate in
connection with the arrangement of such financing.

  



    

 | 78| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5.11 _Stock Exchange Listing_. DENTSPLY and Sirona shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of DENTSPLY Common Stock to be
issued in connection with the Merger (including shares of DENTSPLY Common
Stock to be reserved upon exercise of DENTSPLY Stock Options or vesting of
DENTSPLY RSUs) to be listed on the NASDAQ (or such other stock exchange as may
be mutually agreed upon by DENTSPLY and Sirona), subject to official notice
of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, DENTSPLY and
Sirona shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Sirona Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Sirona Common Stock) or acquisitions of DENTSPLY Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to DENTSPLY Common Stock)
resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
DENTSPLY or Sirona, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

  



  

5.13 _Shareholder Litigation_. Each of DENTSPLY and Sirona shall
provide the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense of
any litigation brought by shareholders of DENTSPLY or shareholders of Sirona
or in the name of DENTSPLY or Sirona against DENTSPLY or Sirona, as
applicable, and/or their respective directors relating to the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; _provided_ , _however_
, that no party shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or
agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any
litigation arising or resulting from the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or consent to the same, without the prior written consent of the
other party (not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

5.14 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of Sirona,
DENTSPLY or Merger Sub shall take, or omit to take, any action that would,
or could reasonably be expected to, prevent or impede the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Both prior to and following the Effective Time, Sirona and DENTSPLY
shall use their reasonable best efforts, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts, to take or cause to be
taken any action necessary for the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _Intended Tax
Treatment_ "), including (i) reasonably refraining from any action that such
party knows, or is reasonably expected to know, is reasonably likely to
prevent the Intended Tax Treatment and (ii) using its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the opinions referred to in _Sections 7.02(d)_ and _7.03(d)_ , and
any tax opinions required to be filed with the SEC in connection with the
filing of the Form S-4, including by executing customary letters of
representation. This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties
hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Each of
DENTSPLY and Sirona shall report the Merger as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and shall not take any position
inconsistent with such treatment unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  



    

 | 79| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, DENTSPLY shall deliver to Sirona a copy of the proposed form
of the DENTSPLY Tax Opinion together with all letters or certificates that
form the basis therefor (collectively, the " _DENTSPLY Tax Opinion Materials_
"). Sirona shall be entitled to a reasonable amount of time to provide
DENTSPLY with written comments on the DENTSPLY Tax Opinion Materials.
DENTSPLY shall furnish Sirona with a copy of the final DENTSPLY Tax Opinion
Materials.

  



  

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, Sirona shall deliver to DENTSPLY a copy of the proposed form
of the Sirona Tax Opinion together with all letters or certificates that form
the basis therefor (collectively, the " _Sirona Tax Opinion Materials_ ").
DENTSPLY shall be entitled to a reasonable amount of time to provide Sirona
with written comments on the Sirona Tax Opinion Materials. Sirona shall
furnish DENTSPLY with a copy of the final Sirona Tax Opinion Materials.

  



  

(d) If following the date of this Agreement and prior to five (5)
Business Days before the reasonably anticipated Closing Date DENTSPLY and
Sirona determine that the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(d)_ and
_Section 6.3(d)_ cannot be satisfied and have not been waived, the parties
hereto may mutually determine to alter the structure of the business
combination between DENTSPLY and Sirona contemplated by this Agreement, by
consummating a second-step merger of the Surviving Corporation with and into a
Delaware limited liability company wholly-owned by DENTSPLY that is
disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in accordance with Delaware Law immediately following the Merger
(such second-step merger, the " _Second Merger_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) such wholly-owned disregarded limited liability company shall become
a party to, and shall become bound by, the terms of this Agreement and (ii)
any action taken pursuant to this _Section 5.14(d)_ shall not (unless
consented to in writing by Sirona and DENTSPLY prior to the Closing) (x) alter
or change the Merger Consideration or any other terms set forth in _Article
1_ or _Article 2_ or (y) otherwise cause any closing condition set forth in
_Article 6_ not to be capable of being satisfied (unless duly waived by the
party entitled to the benefits thereof). If the Second Merger occurs,
references to the Merger in the fifth Recital, _Section 1.8_, _Section

their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable) for all purposes for which such
service was taken into account or recognized by Sirona or DENTSPLY or their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, but not to the extent crediting such
service would result in duplication of benefits.

right in any employee of Sirona, DENTSPLY, the Surviving Corporation or their

Sirona, DENTSPLY, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries
or any right to compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

(f) The parties each agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without
these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if a party fails to pay any amounts due under this _Section
7.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Sirona or DENTSPLY, as the case may
be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against such party for such
amounts, such party shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment
of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the rate equal to
the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal for the relevant period,
together with the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that the DENTSPLY
Termination Fee or the Sirona Termination Fee is payable and actually paid to
DENTSPLY or Sirona in accordance with this _Section 7.3_, payment of such
DENTSPLY Termination Fee or Sirona Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the non-terminating party and its affiliates
against any other party or such other party's shareholders, directors,
officers, affiliates and other Representatives, for any loss or damage based
upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the Transactions contemplated
hereby, except in the case of Willful Breach or fraud. Solely for purposes of
establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and without in any way
increasing the amount of the DENTSPLY Termination Fee or the Sirona
Termination Fee, expanding the circumstances in which the DENTSPLY Termination
Fee or the Sirona Termination Fee, as applicable, is to be paid or
restricting or modifying the other rights of any party hereunder, in the event
of the valid termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which the
DENTSPLY Termination Fee or the Sirona Termination Fee is payable pursuant to
this _Section 7.3_, it is agreed that each of the DENTSPLY Termination Fee
and the Sirona Termination Fee is liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and
the payment thereof in such circumstances is supported by due and sufficient
consideration;  _provided_ , that no payment of a DENTSPLY Termination Fee or
a Sirona Termination Fee shall be considered in lieu of, or a replacement or
substitution for, damages incurred in the event of any Willful Breach or
fraud.

  



  

7.4 _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by
their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the DENTSPLY Shareholder Approval or the Sirona
Shareholder Approval has been obtained; _provided_ , that after the DENTSPLY
Shareholder Approval or the Sirona Shareholder Approval has been obtained, no
amendment shall be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further
approval or adoption by the shareholders of DENTSPLY or shareholders of
Sirona without such further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be
amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct
or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as
an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at
the time of the amendment.

7.5 _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties may, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document
delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions of the other parties contained herein; _provided_ , that after
the DENTSPLY Shareholder Approval or the Sirona Shareholder Approval has been
obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires
further approval or adoption by the shareholders of DENTSPLY or shareholders
of Sirona, as applicable, without such further approval or adoption. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any
course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
which they would otherwise have hereunder.

reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

8.6 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
the DENTSPLY Disclosure Schedules, the Sirona Disclosure Schedules and the
other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any
of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or therein, are not intended to confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder.

  



  

8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

  



  

8.9 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
other than pursuant to _Section 5.9_ , is intended to or shall confer upon
any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement.

8.10 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result
of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words
"include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be
terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, references to a "party" or
the "parties" are intended to refer to a party to this Agreement or the
parties to this Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in
this Agreement to "Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are
intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes
and Schedules to this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to "$" are
intended to refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for
herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. In this Agreement,
when determining whether an item is "material" to DENTSPLY or its Subsidiary
or Sirona or its Subsidiary, the term "material" shall be interpreted to
mean, as applicable, "material to the business of DENTSPLY and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole" or "material to the business of Sirona and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole."

  



  

8.11 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by
Jury_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be
applicable under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not
have jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America, sitting
in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and
each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to
commence any such Proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such Proceeding may be heard and determined in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent permitted by
Law, in such federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in any such court, and
(iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such court.
Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this
Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided
for notices in _Section 8.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right
of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law.

  



    

 | 104| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH
MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH
WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 8.11(c)_.

  



  

8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

8.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement, and any
amendments hereto, waivers hereof or consents or notifications hereunder,
to the extent signed and delivered by facsimile or by email with scan
attachment, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party, each other party shall re-execute original forms thereof
and deliver them to all other parties. No party shall raise the use of
facsimile or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature
or Contract was transmitted or communicated by facsimile or email with scan
attachment as a defense to the formation of a legally binding contract, and
each such party forever waives any such defense.

  



  

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent actual or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state or foreign jurisdiction having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. The parties waive, in connection with
any action for specific performance or injunctive relief, the defense of
adequacy of remedies at Law and any requirement under Law to post a bond or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

8.15 _Disclosure Schedules_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
(a) the inclusion of any items or information in the Disclosure
Schedules that are not required by this Agreement to be so included is solely
for the convenience of parties, (b) the disclosure by the parties of any
matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgement by any party that the matter is required to be disclosed by
the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material or significant, (c)
if any section of the Disclosure Schedules lists an item or information in
such a way as to make its relevance to the disclosure required by or
provided in another section of the Disclosure Schedules or the statements
contained in any Section of this Agreement reasonably apparent, the matter
shall be deemed to have been disclosed in or with respect to such other
section, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-reference to
such other section or the omission of a reference in the particular
representation and warranty to such section of the Disclosure Schedules, (d)
except as provided in clause (c) above, headings have been inserted in the
Disclosure Schedules for convenience of reference only, (e) the Disclosure
Schedules are qualified in their entirety by reference to specific provisions

statements contained therein are not intended to constitute, and shall not be

repealed, and new by-laws enacted, only by the affirmative vote of not less
than two-thirds (2/3) in voting power of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders duly
called for such purpose, or by a vote of not less than a majority of the
entire board of directors then in office; _provided_ that, during the period

(3rd) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of Article VII of the
Corporation's by-laws may be modified, amended or repealed by the board of
directors, and any by-law provision or other resolution inconsistent with
Article VII of the Corporation's by-laws may be adopted by the board of
directors, only by an affirmative vote of the greater of (i) at least seventy
percent (70%) of the entire board of directors and (ii) eight (8) directors.

acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, or (iv) for any transaction from which the
director derived any improper personal benefit. If the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware is hereafter amended to authorize corporate action
further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so
amended. No repeal or modification of this Section 9 shall adversely affect
any right of or protection afforded to a director prior to such repeal or
modification.

   | 10.| The stockholders of the Corporation shall have no authority  to
call a special meeting of the stockholders. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 11.| No action required to be taken or which may be taken at any

without a meeting, and the power of the stockholders to consent in writing,
without a meeting, to the taking of any action is specifically denied.

ARTICLE I

  


  _STOCKHOLDERS ' MEETINGS_

  



  

Section 1. _Annual Meetings_ __. The annual meeting of the
stockholders, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction
of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held
on such date and at such time as shall be designated from time to time by the
Board of Directors.

  



  

Section 2. _Special Meetings_ __. Except as otherwise required by
law and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of
capital stock having a preference over the common stock as to dividends or
upon liquidation, special meetings of stockholders of the corporation may be
called only upon the request of the Chairman of the Board or the
Chief Executive Officer and approved by a resolution adopted by the Board of
Directors.

  



  

Section 3. _Place of Meeting_ __. The Board of Directors may
designate any place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the
place of meeting for any annual meeting, or for any special meeting called
pursuant to Article I, Section 2, above. A waiver of notice signed by all
stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting may designate any place, either
within or without the State of Delaware, as the place for the holding of such
meeting. If no designation is made, or if a special meeting shall be
otherwise called, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the
corporation.

  



  

Section 4. _Notice of Meeting_. Written notice stating the place,
date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not
less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the
meeting either personally or by mail, by or at the discretion of the Chief
Executive Officer or the officer or persons calling the meeting. If mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United
States mail, addressed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the
stock record books of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.

  



    



 



    



  

Section 5. _Fixing of Record Date_.

  



  

(a) For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the
Board of Directors of the corporation may fix, in advance, a date as the
record date for any such determination of stockholders, such date in any case
to be not more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days prior to the date
of any proposed meeting of stockholders. In no event shall the stock transfer
books be closed. When a determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any
meeting of stockholders has been made as provided in this Section, such
determination shall be applied to any adjournment thereof.

  



  

(b) For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to receive
payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or
in order to make a determination of stockholders for any other lawful purpose,
the Board of Directors of the corporation may fix a date as the record date
for any such determination of stockholders, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such
action. In no event shall the stock transfer books be closed.

  



  

Section 6. _Quorum_ __. A majority of the outstanding shares of
the corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. Provided that a meeting has
been duly convened in accordance herewith, any meeting of the stockholders
may be adjourned from time to time without further notice. At any adjourned
meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may
be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
notified. Any meeting (a) at which all of the outstanding shares are present
in person or represented by proxy and at which none of such shares attend for
the purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction
of any business thereat because the meeting was not lawfully called or
convened, or (b) at which all of the outstanding stock has waived notice, or
(c) for which notice shall have been duly given as provided herein, shall be
deemed a properly constituted meeting of the stockholders.

  



  

Section 7. _Proxies_ __. At all meetings of stockholders, a
stockholder entitled to vote may vote by proxy appointed in writing by the
stockholder or by his duly authorized attorney in fact. Such proxy shall be
filed with the Secretary of the corporation before or at the time of
the meeting. An instrument appointing a proxy shall, unless the contrary is
stated thereon, be valid only at the meeting for which it has been given or
any adjournment thereof.

  



  

Section 8. _Voting of Shares_ __. At each meeting of stockholders,
every stockholder entitled to vote thereat shall be entitled to vote in
person or by a duly authorized proxy, which proxy may be appointed by an
instrument in writing executed by such stockholder or his duly authorized
attorney or through electronic means, if applicable, such as the internet.
Subject to the provisions of applicable law and the corporation's Certificate
of Incorporation, each holder of common stock shall be entitled to one (1)
vote for each share of stock standing registered in his name at the close of
business on the day fixed by the Board of Directors as the record date for
the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of and vote at such
meeting. Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by
any officer of such corporation or any proxy appointed by any officer of such
corporation in the absence of express notice of such corporation given in
writing to the Secretary of this corporation in connection with the
particular meeting, that such officer has no authority to vote such shares.

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 9. _List of Stockholders_ __. A complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the ensuing meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each stockholder, shall be prepared by
the Secretary, or other officer of the corporation having charge of
said stock ledger. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10)
days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting
is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting,
or, if not so specified, at the place where said meeting is to be held, and
the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and shall be subject to the inspection of any
stockholder who may be present.

  



  

Section 10. _Waiver of Notice by Stockholders_ __. Whenever any
notice whatever is required to be given to any stockholder of the corporation
under the provisions of these By-Laws or under the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation or under the provisions of any statute, a waiver
thereof in writing, signed at any time, whether before or after the time of
meeting, by the stockholder entitled to such notice, shall be deemed
equivalent to the giving of such notice.

  



  

Section 11. _Advance Notice of Stockholder-Proposed Business at
Annual Meetings_ __. No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of
stockholders, other than business that is either (a) specified in the notice
of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the
Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (b) otherwise
properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board
of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), or (c) otherwise
properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of the
corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of
the notice provided for in this Section 11 and on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such annual
meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this
Section 11.

  



  

In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly
brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder must have

corporation.

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or
mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not
less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior
to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of
stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is
called for a date that is not within twenty-five (25) days before or after
such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be
so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting
was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was
made, whichever first occurs.

  



  

To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must
set forth as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the
annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the annual meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the
annual meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder

Stockholder Associated Person therefrom, (ii) the name and record address of

or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on
behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding
(including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares) has been
made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or
benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting
power of, such stockholder or any such Stockholder Associated Person with
respect to any share of stock of the corporation; (iv) as to the stockholder
giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person covered by clause
(iii) of this paragraph, the name and address of such stockholder, as
they appear on the corporation's stock ledger, and current name and address,
if different, and of such Stockholder Associated Person; (v) a description of
all proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship between such

at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.

Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business shall
be conducted at the annual meeting except business brought before the annual
meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 11;
provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the
annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 11
shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such
business. If the chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was
not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the
foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the
business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall
not be transacted.

  



  

For purposes of this Section 11 and of Section 12 of this Article I,
"Stockholder Associated Person" of any stockholder shall mean (i) any person
controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such
stockholder, (ii) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the corporation
owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder and (iii) any person
controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Stockholder
Associated Person.

  



  

Section 12. _Procedure for Nomination of Directors_. Only persons
who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be
eligible for election as directors of the corporation, except as may be
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the
right of holders of preferred stock of the corporation to nominate and

of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at any annual
meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of stockholders called for
the purpose of electing directors, (a) subject to Article VII of these By-
laws, by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized
committee thereof) or (b) by any stockholder of the corporation (i) who is a

this Section 12 and on the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting and (ii) who complies with
the notice procedures set forth in this Section 12.

regulations promulgated thereunder. Such notice must be accompanied by a
written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to
serve as a director if elected.

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation
unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
12. If the Chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made
in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to
the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination
shall be disregarded.

  



  

Section 13. _Election of Directors_. Except as provided in Section
8 of Article II of these By-laws, a nominee for director shall be elected to
the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed
the votes cast against such nominee's election; provided, however, that
directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of
stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the Corporation receives a notice
that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of
Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder
nominees for director set forth in Article I, Section 12 of these By-laws and
(ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or prior
to the fourteenth day before the date the Corporation first mails to the
stockholders its notice of such meeting.  If directors are to be elected by a
plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote
against a nominee, but only to withhold their vote.

  



  

ARTICLE II

  



  

 _BOARD OF DIRECTORS_

  



  

Section 1. _General Powers_ __. The business and affairs of the
corporation shall be managed by its Board of Directors. Except as otherwise
provided in and subject to Article VII of these By-laws, the Board of
Directors may adopt, amend or repeal by-laws adopted by the Board or by the
stockholders.

  



  

Section 2. _Number of Directors, Tenure and Qualifications_ __.
Except as otherwise provided in and subject to Article VII of these By-laws
or fixed pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation, the number of members
of the Board of Directors shall be not less than three (3) nor more than
thirteen (13), as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. The
directors need not be stockholders of the corporation. Any additional director
elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of
directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders, but
in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any

Section 3. _Regular Meetings_ __. Regular meetings of the Board of
Directors shall be held without any other notice than this By-Law immediately
after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of stockholders, and each

place, either within or without the State of Delaware, for the holding of
additional regular meetings without other notice than such designation.

  



  

Section 4. _Special Meetings_ __. Special meetings of the Board of
Directors may be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board,

special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any place either within or
without the State of Delaware, as the place for holding any special meeting
of the Board of Directors called by them.

  



  

Section 5. _Notice_. Notice of any special meeting shall be given
at least five (5) days previously thereto by written notice delivered or
mailed to each director at his last known address, or at least forty-eight

shall be deemed to be delivered when transmitted with receipt confirmed.
Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given to any director of the
corporation under the provisions of these By-Laws or under the provisions of
the Certificate of Incorporation or under the provisions of any statute, a
waiver thereof in writing, signed at any time, whether before or after the
time of meeting, by the director entitled to such notice, shall be deemed
equivalent to the giving of such notice. The attendance of a director at a
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting except where a
director attends a meeting and objects thereat to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the
business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special
meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of
notice of such meeting.

  



  

Section 6. _Quorum_ __. During the Specified Period (as defined in

a quorum is not present at a duly called meeting of the Board of Directors, a
majority of the directors present at such duly called meeting may adjourn the
meeting and, upon delivery of a notice in accordance with Article II, Section
5 to the director(s), reschedule such meeting for an alternative date, and,
at such rescheduled meeting, a majority of the total number of directors shall
constitute a quorum.

Article VII of these By-laws, any vacancy on the Board of Directors that

present, and any other vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors shall be
filled by a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a
quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director elected to fill a
vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have
the same remaining term as that of his or her predecessor. The resignation of
a director shall be effective upon receipt by the corporation, unless some
subsequent time is fixed in the resignation, and then from that time.
Acceptance of such resignation by the corporation shall not be required.

supplemented or amended by further resolution adopted by a like vote, shall

powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and
affairs of the corporation, except action with respect to amendment of the

 _STOCK AND TRANSFER OF STOCK_

  



  

Section 1. _Shares of Stock_ __. The shares of capital stock of
the corporation shall be represented by a certificate, unless and until the
Board of Directors of the corporation adopts a resolution permitting shares to
be uncertificated. Notwithstanding the adoption of any such resolution
providing for uncertificated shares, every holder of capital stock of
the corporation theretofore represented by certificates and, upon request,
every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a
certificate for shares of capital stock of the corporation signed by the Chief
Executive Officer and by the Secretary. To the extent that shares are
represented by certificates, the certificates shall be in such form as shall
be determined by the Board of Directors and shall be consecutively numbered
or otherwise identified. The name and address of the person to whom
the shares represented thereby are issued, with the number of shares and date
of issue, shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the corporation.
With respect to certificated shares of stock, all certificates surrendered to
the corporation for transfer shall be canceled and no new certificate or
uncertificated shares shall be issued until the former certificate for a like
number of shares shall have been surrendered and canceled, except that in
case of a lost, destroyed or mutilated certificate, a new certificate or
uncertificated shares may be issued therefor upon such terms and indemnity to
the corporation as the Board of Directors may prescribe.

  



  

Section 2. _Transfer of Shares_ __. Stock of the corporation shall
be transferable in the manner prescribed by applicable law and in these By-
Laws. Transfers of stock shall be made on the books of the corporation, and in
the case of certificated shares of stock, only by the person named in the
certificate or by such person's attorney lawfully constituted in writing and
upon the surrender of the certificate therefor, properly endorsed for transfer
and payment of all necessary transfer taxes; or, in the case of
uncertificated shares of stock, upon receipt of proper transfer instructions
from the registered holder of the shares or by such person's attorney
lawfully constituted in writing, and upon payment of all necessary
transfer taxes and compliance with appropriate procedures for transferring
shares in uncertificated form; provided, however, that such surrender and
endorsement, compliance or payment of taxes shall not be required in any case
in which the officers of the corporation shall determine to waive such
requirement. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of a
certificate representing shares of capital stock of the corporation or of
proper transfer instructions with respect to uncertificated shares, the
corporation may treat the registered owner of such shares as the person
exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notifications and otherwise to
exercise all the rights and powers of an owner. Where a certificate for shares
is presented to the corporation with a request to register for transfer, the
corporation shall not be liable to the owner or any other person suffering
loss as a result of such registration of transfer if (a) there were on or
with the certificate the necessary endorsements, and (b) the corporation
had no duty to inquire into adverse claims or has discharged any such duty.
The corporation may require reasonable assurance that said endorsements are
genuine and effective and in compliance with such other regulations as may be
prescribed under the authority of the Board of Directors.

 _INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,_

  



  

 _EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS_

  



  

Section 1. _Indemnification Generally_ __. The corporation shall
indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an
action by or in the right of the corporation), by reason of the fact that he
or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation,
or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, or is alleged to have violated the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, against expenses
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties, and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with
such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a
manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, conviction, or upon plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did
not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe
that his or her conduct was unlawful.

  



  

Section 2. _Indemnification in Actions By or In the Right Of the
Corporation_ __. The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred
by him or her in connection with the defense and settlement of such action or
suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of
Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court
of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.

  



  

Section 4. _Determination that Indemnification is Proper_ __. Any
indemnification under Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article V, unless

specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director,
officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances under the standard
of conduct set forth in such Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article V, as the
case may be. Such determination shall be made:

  



  

(a) By the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum
consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or
proceeding;

  



  

(b) If such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable if a
quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in
a written opinion; or

  



  

(c) By the stockholders.

  



  

Section 5. _Insurance; Indemnification Agreements_ __. The
corporation may, but shall not be required to, supplement the right of
indemnification under this Article V by any lawful means, including, without
limitation by reason of enumeration, (i) the purchase and maintenance of
insurance on behalf of any one or more of such indemnitees, whether or not the
corporation would be obligated to indemnify such person under this Article V
or otherwise, and (ii) individual or group indemnification agreements with
any one or more of such indemnities.

  



  

Section 6. _Advancement of Expenses_. Expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by an indemnitee in defending any civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by
the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he
or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as to such
amounts.

  



    

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 7. _Rights Not Exclusive_ __. The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by this Article V shall be not deemed
exclusive of any other right to which an indemnified person may be entitled
under Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (or
any successor provision) or otherwise under applicable law, or under any
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both
as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another
capacity while holding such office and shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

  



  

Section 8. _Severability_ __. To the extent that any court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that the indemnification provided under
this Article V shall be invalid as applied to a particular claim, issue or
matter, the provisions hereof shall be deemed amended to allow
indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by law.

  



  

Section 9. _Modification_ __. This Article V shall be deemed to be
a contract between the corporation and each previous, current or future
director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Article V shall
be applicable to all actions, claims, suits or proceedings, commenced after
the adoption hereof, whether arising from any action taken or failure to act
before or after such adoption. No amendment, modification or repeal of this
Article V shall diminish the rights provided hereby or diminish the right to
indemnification with respect to any claim, issue or matter in any then
pending or subsequent proceeding which is based in any material respect from
any alleged action or failure to act prior to such amendment, modification or
repeal.

DENTSPLY SIRONA INC. 
 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES/POLICIES

  



  

The following Corporate Governance Guidelines have been adopted by the Board
of Directors of DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (the " _Company_ ") to assist the Board
in the exercise of its responsibilities. These Corporate Governance Guidelines
reflect the Board's commitment to monitor the effectiveness of policy and
decision making both at the Board and management level. These Corporate
Governance Guidelines shall be reviewed by the Board, through the Corporate
Governance and Nominating Committee (or successor thereof) (the " _Governance
Committee_ "), on a periodic basis and are subject to modification from time
to time by the Board in accordance with the By-Laws of the Company.

  



   | I.| _Functions/Responsibilities of the Board of Directors_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Directors oversee and direct the management of the business and affairs
of the Company in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law and as
set forth in the Company's By-Laws. Directors shall discharge the duties of
their positions in good faith, in a manner reasonably believed to be in the
best interests of the Company and with such care, skill and diligence,
including reasonable inquiry as a person of ordinary prudence would use under
similar circumstances. The responsibility of the Board of Directors is to
supervise and direct the management of the Company. To that end, the role of
the Board of Directors (references to the Board include the Committees of the
Board, as applicable) shall include, but not be limited to:

  



   | (1)| The selection, appointment and regular evaluation of
the performance, and approval of the compensation of, the Chief Executive
Officer and, with the advice of the Chief Executive Officer, the principal
senior executives;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| The development of plans for succession with respect to the
position of Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and monitoring
succession planning for other key executives;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| Oversight of the conduct of the Company's business and
evaluation of whether the business is being properly managed;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| Review and, where appropriate, approval of the
Company's objectives, plans and actions, including its longer term strategic
plans;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (5)| Review of the Company's financial statements;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (6)| Assessment of major risk factors relating to the Company and its
performance, and review of measures taken or intended to be taken to address
and mitigate such risks; and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (7)| Evaluation of whether appropriate systems and processes are in
place to support the effective management of the Company in accordance with
applicable legal requirements and the Company's Code of Business Conduct and
Ethics.  
---|---|--- 
  



    

 | 1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

II. _Selection/Service of Board Members_

  



   | A.| _Identification_. The responsibility for the selection of new
Directors resides with the Board and stockholders. The identification,
screening and recommendation process has been delegated to the Governance
Committee, which reviews candidates for election as Directors, recommends
candidates to the Board to fill vacant Board seats and annually recommends a
slate of Directors for approval by the Board and election by the stockholders
of the Company.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | B.| _Non-Discrimination_. Potential candidates for membership on the
Board and Committees of the Board shall not be denied consideration by reason
of race, gender, religion, color or ethnicity, nor shall any candidate be
approached or selected solely because of any such reason.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | C.| _Independence_. The Board shall be comprised of a majority of
independent Directors, and no less than are required by NASDAQ or applicable
law. Independence shall be defined as provided by the rules and regulations
of NASDAQ and the Securities Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") law. The
Board, in consultation with the Company's Secretary, shall undertake an
annual review of the independence of all non-employee Directors. In advance
of the meeting at which this review occurs, each non-employee Director shall
provide to the Company for presentation to the Board, full information
regarding the Director's business and other relationships with the Company and
its affiliates, and with senior management and their affiliates, to enable
the Board to evaluate the Director's independence.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Directors have an affirmative obligation to inform the Board of any material
changes in their circumstances or relationships that may impact their
designation by the Board as "independent." This obligation includes all
business relationships between Directors, their immediate families and
organizations in which they perform a material function, and the Company and
its affiliates or members of senior management and their affiliates, whether
or not such business relationships are subject to the approval requirement set
forth elsewhere in these Guidelines.

  



   | D.| _Criteria for the Nomination_ :  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.| The Governance Committee shall consider for selection
as Directors those persons:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | a.| who possess strong personal and professional ethics, and high
standards of integrity and values;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | b.| who have the proven ability and experience to bring
informed, thoughtful and well-considered opinions to corporate management and
the Board;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | c.| who have the competence, maturity and integrity to monitor and
evaluate the Company's management, performance and policies;  
---|---|--- 
  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | d.| who have the willingness, commitment and availability to devote
the necessary time and effort required for service on the Board;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | e.| who have the capacity to provide additional strength
and diversity of view to the Board and its activities;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | f.| who have the necessary measure of communication skills and self-
confidence to ensure ease of participation in Board discussion;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | g.| who hold or have held a senior position with a
significant business enterprise or a position of senior leadership in an
educational, medical, religious, or other non-profit institution or
foundation of significance; and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | h.| who meet the requirements of Article VII of the Company's By-
Laws.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| Persons who have attained the age of 75 shall not be eligible for
election or reelection as a Director.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3.| Any Director who (i) retires from; or (ii) discontinues their
active employment with the business or other enterprise with which they were
primarily affiliated at the time of their most recent election to the Board;
or (iii) incurs a significant change in responsibilities, title or activities
since their most recent election to the Board, shall submit their resignation
upon the occurrence of any of the aforesaid events. The Governance
Committee will review the effects of this change upon the interests of the
Company and recommend to the Board whether to accept such resignation. If
such resignation is not accepted, it shall be deemed rejected.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 4.| It is the responsibility of each Director to advise the Corporate
Secretary of any actual or potential conflict of interest, as well as any
affiliation with public or privately held enterprises, including for profit
and non-profit entities, that may create a potential conflict of interest,
embarrassment to the Company or inconsistency with the Company's policies or
values.  
---|---|--- 
  



   E.| | _Number of Board Seats_.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 1.| The Company does not have a policy specifying a maximum number of
other company boards upon which a Director may sit. However, it is recognized
that other activities of Board members, including service on multiple Boards,
could affect the ability of a Director to effectively serve on the Company's
Board and therefore, no director shall accept a position on another Board
which would result in the Director sitting on more than three (3) Boards,
without prior review and approval of the Governance Committee.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| Directors are expected to advise the Chairman of the Board and
the Chairman of the Governance Committee in advance of accepting any other
company directorship or any assignment to the audit committee or compensation
committee of the board of directors of any other company.  
---|---|--- 
  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | F.| _Size of Board_. The By-laws of the Company provide that the
size of the Board of Directors shall consist of not more than thirteen (13)
Directors. The Board shall determine the number of Directors as deemed
appropriate by the Board, subject to the Company's By-laws.  
---|---|--- 
  



   III.| | _Term_   
---|---|--- 
  



   | A.| _Normal Terms_. Directors shall hold office from the time of
their election and qualification and shall serve until the next annual meeting
of stockholders and until the election and qualification of their successor
or until such Director's earlier death, resignation, disqualification or
removal. Any open Director position in the Board for any reason, including a
vacancy resulting from an increase in the specific size of the Board, may be
filled by action of the Board of Directors in accordance with the By-Laws of
the Company.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | B.| _Management Director Resignation_. A Director who also is an
officer of the Company, who either resigns or retires their officer position,
shall simultaneously submit their resignation as a Director, acceptance of
which shall be at the discretion of the Board.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | C.| _Term Limits_. The Board does not believe it should establish
term limits. While term limits could help ensure that there are fresh ideas
and viewpoints available to the Board, they hold the disadvantage of losing
the contribution of Directors who have been able to develop, over a period of
time, increasing insight into the Company and its operations and, therefore,
provide an increasing contribution to the Board as a whole.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | D.| _Retirement_. A Director who attains the age of 75 shall be
required to retire from the Board at the next Annual Stockholders' meeting.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | IV.| _Stock Ownership of Directors_   
---|---|--- 
  



   | | It is the policy of the Board that all Directors hold an equity
interest in the Company.  Toward this end, the Board expects that all
Directors own, or acquire within five years of first becoming a Director,
shares  of common stock of the Company (including share units held under the
Company's Board of Directors Deferred Compensation  Plan, or any successor
plan, and restricted stock units, but not including stock options) having a
market value of at least  five times the annual retainer paid to Board
members. The Board recognizes that exceptions to this policy may be necessary
or  appropriate in individual cases, and may approve such exceptions from
time to time as it deems appropriate.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | V.| _Board Meetings_   
---|---|--- 
  



   | A.| _Scheduling of Meetings_. The Chairman, in consultation with
other members of the Board, shall determine the timing and length of the
meetings of the Board. The Board expects that five to six meetings per year
at appropriate intervals are generally desirable for the performance of the
Board's responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled meetings,
additional Board meetings may be called upon appropriate notice at any time to
address specific needs of the Company. A special meeting of the Board may be
called at any time by the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman or by members
of the Board of Directors constituting no less than three-fourths (3/4) of the
total number of directors then in office. Participation in meetings may be by
means of conference telephone with the prior authorization from the
Chairman.  
---|---|--- 
  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | B.| _Agenda_. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in
conjunction with the Lead Independent Director, shall establish the agenda for
each Board meeting. Each Director shall be entitled to suggest the inclusion
of items on the agenda, request the presence of any member of the Company's
senior management, or at any Board meeting raise subjects that are not on the
agenda for that meeting. Subject to reasonable exception, Directors shall be
advised of significant agenda items and shall be furnished with appropriate
supporting materials, including minutes of Board and Committee meetings, in
advance of meetings of the Board and Committees of the Board.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | C.| _Management Presentations_. Management shall make presentations
to the Board on the performance, operations, strategies and significant
activities of the Company.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | D.| _Executive Sessions_. The Board will generally meet in Executive
Session at each meeting and in any event, in Executive Sessions of the
independent Directors no less than twice a year. Executive Sessions of the
independent Directors will be chaired by the Lead Independent Director.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | VI.| _Attendance_   
---|---|--- 
  



   | A.| _Board Meetings_. It is expected that Board Members will make
every effort to attend every Board Meeting and meetings of their respective
Committees.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | B.| _Annual Stockholders Meeting_. It is expected that Board Members
will attend the Annual Stockholders Meeting, except when exceptional
circumstances prevent such attendance.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | VII.| _Chairman of the Board_   
---|---|--- 
  



   | A.| Subject to and in accordance with the By-laws of the Company, the
Chairman of the Board shall be elected by and serve at the pleasure of the
Board of Directors. The Board has no policy restricting the Chief Executive
Officer from serving as the Chairman.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | B.| The Chairman shall schedule board meetings and call meetings.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | C.| The Executive Chairman shall be designated the Chairman of the
Board until such time as the Board determines otherwise in accordance with
Section 3 of Article VII of the By-Laws of the Company (if such provision is
applicable at such time).  
---|---|--- 
  



   | VIII.| _Roles and Responsibilities: Executive Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer_   
---|---|--- 
  



   | A.| The roles and responsibilities of the Executive Chairman and the
Chief Executive Officer are set forth in the By-laws of the Company and on

---|---|--- 
  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | IX.| _Lead Independent Director_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

An independent Director shall act in a lead capacity to perform certain
functions (" _Lead Independent Director_ ") as outlined below. Except as
otherwise provided in and subject to the By-laws of the Company, for so long
as the Chairman of the Board is also an officer or employee of the Company
(i.e., an Executive Chairman), or for any other reason is not an independent
director, then the independent directors of the Board of Directors shall
annually elect one of the independent directors to serve as the Lead
Independent Director and shall fill any vacancy in the position of Lead
Independent Director, when applicable, at such time and in such manner as
the independent directors of the Board of Directors shall determine, provided
that the Lead Independent Director may only be selected from among the
independent directors.

  



  

The Lead Independent Director's responsibilities are to:

  



   | (a)| call for and preside at Executive Sessions of the
independent Directors;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| provide the Chairman with input into the agenda for
Board meetings, and on other matters as deemed appropriate by the Board, or
on behalf of the independent Directors, and recommend the agenda for
Executive Sessions of independent Directors, to the extent deemed necessary;
and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| be available for consultation with other Directors, and apprise
the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, of activities of
the Board in Executive Sessions of the independent directors.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | X.| _Board Committees_   
---|---|--- 
  



   | A.| _Generally_. Standing and/or temporary committees may be
appointed by the Board from time to time. The Board may vest committees with
such power and authority as the Board determines appropriate, subject to such
limitations as are set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law and the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. In general, Committees of
the Board focus on issues that may require more in-depth time or
attention than could be consistently provided by the full Board. There are
currently three standing committees:  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Audit and Finance Committee (" _Audit Committee_ ")

  



  

Human Resources Committee (" _HR Committee_ ")

  



  

Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (" _Governance Committee_ ")

  



   | B.| _Charters_. Each standing Committee shall have a written charter
of responsibilities, duties and authorities, which shall periodically be
reviewed by the Board. Each Committee shall report to the full Board with
respect to its activities, findings and recommendations.  
---|---|--- 
  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | C.| _Advisors_. Each Committee shall have full power and authority
to retain the services of such advisors and experts, including counsel, as the
Committee deems necessary or appropriate with respect to specific matters
within its purview.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | D.| _Committee Assignments_. Subject to and in accordance with the
By-laws of the Company, the Governance Committee, after consideration of the
desires, experience and expertise of individual Directors, shall recommend to
the Board the assignment of Directors to Committees, including the designation
of Committee Chairs. In acting upon such recommendation and report, the full
Board shall give consideration to the following objectives:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| the target size of each Committee is three or more members, unless
circumstances call for an exception;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| a Committee Chair shall stay on the Committee for one year after
stepping down as the Chair;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | *| the Audit, Human Resources and Governance Committees shall be
composed entirely of independent Directors.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | E.| _Committee Meetings_. Each Committee Chair, in consultation with
the Chairman of the Board, Committee members and management of the Company
shall establish agendas and set meetings at the frequency and length
appropriate and necessary to carry out the Committee's responsibilities. Any
Director who is not a member of a particular Committee may attend any
Committee meeting with the concurrence of the Committee Chair or a majority
of the members of the Committee.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | XI.| _Compensation_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

Directors who are not also officers of the company shall be appropriately
compensated for their service on the Board. This compensation shall take into
consideration the amount of time required to be devoted to Board activities,
the fiduciary responsibility of such positions and the competitiveness of the
compensation levels. Compensation is subject to change at the discretion of
the Board. The current composition of compensation paid to Outside Directors
shall be comprised of an annual Board retainer fee, annual Committee retainer
fees, Committee Chair and Lead Independent Director fees, all paid quarterly;
and an equity incentive component under the Company's Equity
Incentive Plan(s). The Company has adopted a deferred compensation plan which
allows Directors to defer payment of their Board compensation. This plan and
Director compensation may be changed from time to time by action of the Board.

  



   | XII.| _Self-Evaluation by the Board_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Governance Committee will manage a self-assessment process of the Board's
performance as well as follow up on self-assessments performed by the
Committees of the Board, the results of which will be discussed with the full
Board, including reviewing and recommending to the Board changes identified
by the Committees. The Governance Committee will also utilize the results of
this self-evaluation process in assessing and determining the characteristics
and critical skills required of prospective candidates for election to the
Board.

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | XIII.| _Director Education_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Company shall assist the Board by providing appropriate orientation
programs for new Directors, which shall be designed both to familiarize new
Directors with the full scope of the Company's businesses and to assist them
in developing and maintaining skills necessary or appropriate for the
performance of their responsibilities. The Board and the Company's management
shall similarly work together to develop and periodically implement
appropriate continuing education programs for Board members.

  



   | XIV.| _Expenses_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

Directors shall be reimbursed for ordinary, necessary and reasonable expenses
incident to their service on the Board and to their attendance at meetings of
the Board, Committees of the Board and the annual stockholders meeting.
Requests for reimbursement for expenses over $75.00 must be accompanied by a
receipt for such expenses. Directors shall be reimbursed for air travel
expenses not exceeding the first-class commercial air travel rate. All such
requests are to be forwarded to the Secretary of the Company for processing.

  



   | XV.| _Capital Expenditures and Acquisitions_  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Management shall submit to the Board an Annual Capital Expenditure Budget for
Board approval at the same time the Annual Operating Budget is submitted.

  



  

While the Capital Expenditure Budget will outline anticipated projects, the
projects may change at the discretion of management as long as total annual
capital expenditures do not exceed the total Annual Budget and subject to the
individual expenditure approval levels established by the Board. If
management anticipates that expenditures will exceed the amount budgeted, it
must obtain Board approval for amounts that exceed the approved budget.

  



  

Management authority to approve funding for individual capital expenditures,
sale of assets and acquisitions is as follows:

  



     Up to $15 million  | Chief Executive Officer, and other executives
with the direction of the Chief Executive Officer 
---|--- 
     | 
   Greater than $15 million  | Board of Directors 
  



    

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | XVI.| _Communications_   
---|---|--- 
 

  



   | A.| _Communications With Management_. As the role of the Board is
oversight of management and not directing the operations of the Company, in
general, Board members should communicate principally with the Chief
Executive Officer and other senior management of the Company. Board members
should carefully consider any communications with Company employees to ensure
it is an appropriate subject for communication.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | B.| _Communications to Board_. All Board members, including their
Committee assignments, are identified each year in the Company's Proxy
Statement. Communications which are intended for Board members can be sent to
the Company's Secretary at the Company's Headquarters for delivery to
individual Board members. Mail received will be delivered to the respective
Board member to which the communication is addressed. Mail addressed to
"Outside Directors" or "Non-Management Directors" will be forwarded or
delivered to the Chairman of the Governance Committee. Mail addressed to the
"Board of Directors" will be forwarded or delivered to the Chairman of the
Board.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | C.| _Communications with Third Parties_. To help shield directors
from general questions from media representatives and others, it is the
Company's policy that directors should respond by indicating that, as a
general matter, the Company's spokesmen are the Chairman or the Chief
Executive Officer or their designees and that comments on behalf of the
Company would come from such a person. Directors should at all times
maintain the confidentiality of sensitive or proprietary Company
information.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | D.| _Director Nominations_. The Directors welcome and are willing to
consider  recommendations from stockholders for Director nominations.
Stockholders desiring to make candidate recommendations for the  Board may do
so by submitting nominations to the Company or the Company's Governance
Committee, in accordance with the  Company's Bylaws and addressed to the
Corporate Secretary or to the Chairman of the Governance Committee at the 
following address: DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc., 221 West Philadelphia Street, York,
Pennsylvania 17405-0872.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

THESE GUIDELINES/POLICIES, INCLUDING ANY EXHIBITS ATTACHED HERETO, SHALL BE
SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS REQUIRED BY LAW OR AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BY-LAWS OF THE COMPANY.

provided that the involvement does not undermine the authority of the CEO.
The Executive Chairman will work closely with the CEO to merge the talent and
cultures of the combined Companies. The Executive Chairman will work together
