trading day immediately preceding such calendar day. 
---|--- 

 



 

     | (c) | At the Effective Time, all Seller Shares that are owned
directly or indirectly by Buyer or Seller or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (other than Seller Shares (x) held directly or indirectly in
trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary
capacity for the benefit of third parties (any such shares, and shares of

Merger, the following shall occur: 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (i) | Each Seller Stock Option which is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, upon the election
of the holder thereof, be terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time
and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of each Seller

Seller Stock Option. 
---|---|--- 

 



 



 

4

 



 



 

     | (ii) | Each Seller Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that is not terminated pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i) above
shall be amended and converted into an option (an " **Adjusted Option** ") to
purchase a number of Buyer Shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal
to (A) the number of Seller Shares subject to such Seller Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio;
and the per share exercise price for the Buyer Shares issuable upon the
exercise of such Adjusted Option shall be equal to (Y) the exercise price per
share of the Seller Shares at which such Seller Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (Z) the Exchange Ratio
(rounded to the nearest whole cent); provided, however, that in the case of
any Seller Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of
its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the conversion formula shall
be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. Except
as otherwise provided herein, the Adjusted Options shall be subject to the
same terms and conditions (including expiration date, vesting and exercise
provisions) as were applicable to the corresponding Seller Stock Options

---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (b) | The adjustments provided herein with respect to any Seller

consistent with Sections 422 and 424(a) of the Code and all regulations
promulgated thereunder. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (c) | At the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume the Seller Stock
Plans, with the result that all obligations of Seller under the Seller Stock
Option Plans (as that term is defined in Section 3.01(b)) with respect to the
Adjusted Options shall be obligations of Buyer following the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (d) | On or prior to the date that is thirty (30) days after the
Effective Time, Buyer shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a number of
shares of Buyer Shares equal to at least the number of shares subject to the
Adjusted Options. Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be
maintained) as long as any Adjusted Options may remain outstanding. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (e) | Except as otherwise specifically provided by this Section
2.02 and except to the extent required under the respective terms of Seller
Stock Options as 
---|---|--- 

 



 



 

5

 



 



 

    |  | in effect on the date of this Agreement, all restrictions or
limitations on transfer with respect to Seller Stock Options awarded under
Seller Stock Option Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement of Seller
or any of its subsidiaries, to the extent that such restrictions or
limitations shall not have already lapsed, and all other terms thereof, shall
remain in full force and effect with respect to such options after giving
effect to the Merger and the assumption by Buyer as set forth above. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (f) | In addition to any method of exercise permitted under the
applicable Seller Stock Option, a holder of an Adjusted Option may exercise
such Adjusted Option in whole or in part in accordance with its terms by
delivering a properly executed notice of exercise to Buyer, together with the
consideration therefor and the federal withholding tax information, if any,
required in accordance with the related Seller Stock Option Plan. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

 **2.03.** **_Election and Exchange and Payment Procedures_**

 



 

     | (a) | _Election Procedure_. An election form and other
appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
theretofore representing the Seller Shares shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent (as defined below))in such
form as Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree (the " **Election Form** ")
shall be mailed 20 calendar days prior to the anticipated Effective Time or on
such other date as Seller and Buyer shall mutually agree (the " **Mailing
Date** ") to each holder of record of Seller Shares as of the close of
business on the fifth trading day prior to the Mailing Date (the " **Election
Form Record Date** "). 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (b) | _Election_. Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or
the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and
instructions) to specify (i) the number of such holders Seller Shares with
respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration (" **Stock Election Shares** "), (ii) the number of such
holders Seller Shares with respect to which such holder elects to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration (" **Cash Election Shares** "), or (iii) that
such holder makes no election with respect to such holders Seller Shares ("
**No Election Shares** "). All Seller Shares with respect to which the
Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form
on or before 5:00 p.m., on the 17th calendar day following the Mailing Date
(or such other time and date as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree) (the "
**Election Deadline** ") shall also be deemed to be No Election Shares. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (c) | _Exchange Agent; Election Forms_. Buyer will designate
Computershare Investor Services, LLC or such other entity as reasonably shall
be approved by Seller in writing to act as agent (the " **Exchange Agent** ")
for purposes of conducting the election procedure and the exchange and 
---|---|--- 

 



 



 

6

 



 



 

    |  | payment procedures as described in this Section 2.03. Buyer
shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested
from time to time by all persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of
Seller Shares between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business
on the business day prior to the Election Deadline, and Seller shall provide
to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform
as specified herein. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (d) | _Proper Election._ Any such election shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form
shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more
certificates (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss
or destruction of such certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such
certificates) representing all Seller Shares covered by such Election Form,
together with duly executed transmittal materials included in the Election
Form; provided, however, that holders of Seller Shares shall be instructed to
execute revocable stock powers in respect of such certificates and not to
endorse such certificates for transfer. Any Election Form may be revoked or
changed by the person submitting such Election Form at or prior to the
Election Deadline. If an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election
Deadline and a new Election Form is not submitted prior to the Election
Deadline, the Seller Shares represented by such Election Form shall become No
Election Shares and Buyer shall cause the certificates representing such
Seller Shares to be promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting
the Election Form upon written request to that effect from the holder who
submitted the Election Form. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. Neither Buyer nor the Exchange Agent shall be under
any obligation to notify any person of any defect in the election form. In the
event of the termination of this Agreement before the Effective Time, all
Election Forms shall be null, void and of no force or effect and all
certificates shall immediately be returned to holders of Seller shares, along
with stock powers in respect thereof. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (e) | _Pro Rata Allocation_. Within ten business days after the
Election Deadline, unless the Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which
case as soon thereafter as practicable, Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent
to effect the allocation among the holders of Seller Shares of rights to
receive Buyer Shares or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election
Forms as follows: 
---|---|--- 

 



 

7

 



 



 

     | (1) | _Cash Election Shares More Than Total Cash Amount._ If the
aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the conversion in the Merger of
the Cash Election Shares (the " **Section 2.03(e) Cash Amount** ") is greater
than the Total Cash Amount, then: 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (A) | all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (B)  | the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash
Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of
shares (" **Stock Designated Shares** ") such that the aggregate cash amount
that will be paid in the Merger (excluding, however, any cash paid in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to 2.03(j) hereof, any cash paid to dissenting
shareholders pursuant to Section 2.04 hereof and any cash paid in respect of
options to purchase Seller Shares under Section 2.02 or any other provision of
this Agreement) equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and
all Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration; and 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (C) | the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated
Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (2) | _Cash Election Shares Less Than Total Cash Amount._ If the
Section 2.03(e) Cash Amount is less than the Total Cash Amount, then: 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (A) | all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (B) | the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No
Election Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares,
by a pro rata selection process (excluding, to the extent possible, Seller
Shares acquired through the exercise of any incentive stock option at any time
within twelve months prior to the Effective Time, which shares are identified
on Exhibit 2.01(e)(2)(B) hereto), a sufficient number of shares (" **Cash
Designated Shares** ") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid
in the Merger (excluding, however, without limitation, any cash paid in
respect of options to purchase Seller Shares under Section 2.02 or any other
provision of this Agreement) equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash
Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares shall be converted 
---|---|--- 

 



 

8

 



 



 

    |  | into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; and 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (C) | the Stock Election Shares and the No Election Shares that
are not Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (3) | _Cash Election Shares Equal to Total Cash Amount._ If the
Section 2.03(e) Cash Amount is equal or nearly equal (as determined by the
Exchange Agent) to the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (1) and (2) above
shall not apply, all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and No
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist
of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually determined by
Buyer and Seller.

 



 

     | (f) | _Deposit with Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. At or prior
to the Effective Time, Buyer shall provide to the Exchange Agent the number of
Buyer Shares issuable pursuant to Sections 2.01(a) and 2.03, the Total Cash
Amount, the cash in respect of fractional Buyer Shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.03(j), and the amount of all other cash payable in the Merger, if
any, all of which shall be held by the Exchange Agent in trust for the holders
of Seller Shares (collectively, the " **Exchange Fund** "). The Exchange Agent
shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect
to the Buyer Shares held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it
shall receive and hold in trust for the recipients of the Buyer Shares until
distributed thereto pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement all dividends
or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such Buyer Shares
for the account of the persons entitled thereto. The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any purpose other than as set forth in this paragraph. The
Exchange Agent shall invest cash in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Buyer,
on a daily basis; provided, however, that all such investments shall be in (1)
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, (2) commercial
paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or (3) certificates of
deposit of commercial banks (not including any Subsidiary or affiliate of
Buyer) with capital exceeding $1.0 billion. All interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Buyer. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (g) | _Surrender of Seller Certificates_. As promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, Buyer shall send or cause to be sent to
each former holder of record of Seller Shares who did not comply with Section
2.03(d) of this Agreement, transmittal materials (which shall specify that
delivery shall 
---|---|--- 

 



 

9

 



 



 

    |  | be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
theretofore representing the Seller Shares shall pass only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent). Each holder of an
outstanding certificate or certificates which prior to the Effective Time
represented Seller Shares (" **Seller Certificate** "), who surrenders such
Seller Certificate to the Exchange Agent shall, upon acceptance thereof by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to a certificate representing the full number of
Buyer Shares and/or the amount of cash into which the aggregate number of
Seller Shares previously represented by such Seller Certificate surrendered
shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and, if such holders
Seller Shares have been converted into Buyer Shares, any other distribution
theretofore paid with respect to Buyer Shares issuable in the Merger which
remains unpaid at the Effective Time, in each case without interest. The
Exchange Agent shall accept such Seller Certificate upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to affect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices and
shall as promptly as practicable issue the certificates representing Buyer
Shares and/or cash in accordance with this Agreement. Each Seller Certificate
that is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided,
until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent be deemed to evidence ownership
of the number of Buyer Shares or the right to receive the amount of cash into
which such Seller Shares shall have been converted. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no further transfer on the records of Seller of a Seller
Certificate representing Seller Shares and, if any such Seller Certificate is
presented to Seller for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of
certificates for Buyer Shares and/or cash as hereinabove provided. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (h) | _Lost Certificates._ If there shall be delivered to the
Exchange Agent by any person who is unable to produce any Seller Certificate
for Seller Shares for surrender to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this
Section 2.03: 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (i) | evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Seller Certificate has been lost, wrongfully taken, or
destroyed; 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (ii) | such security or indemnity as reasonably may be requested
by the Surviving Corporation to save it harmless (which may include the
requirement to obtain a third party bond or surety); and 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (iii) | evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such person was the owner of the Seller Shares theretofore
repre-sented by each such Seller Certificate claimed by him to be lost,
wrongfully taken or destroyed and that he is the person who would be entitled
to present such Seller Certificate for exchange pursuant to this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 

 



 

10

 



 

then the Exchange Agent, in the absence of actual notice to it that any Seller
Shares theretofore represented by any such Seller Certificate have been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, shall deliver to such person the cash
and/or Buyer Shares (and cash in lieu of fractional Buyer Share interests, if
any) that such person would have been entitled to receive upon surrender of
each such lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed Seller Certificate.

 



 

     | (i) | _No Further Ownership Rights in Seller Shares_. All cash
and Buyer Shares issued upon conversion of Seller Shares in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.03(g) or
2.03(j)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Seller Shares, _subject, however_ , to the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or
made by Seller on such Seller Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (j) | _No Fractional Buyer Shares_. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (i) | No certificates or scrip representing fractional Buyer
Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Seller Certificates
evidencing Seller Shares, and such fractional Buyer Share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of the
Surviving Corporation. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (ii) | Each holder of Seller Shares who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fractional Buyer Share shall receive from the Exchange
Agent an amount of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the
fractional Buyer Share interest to which such holder (after taking into
account all Seller Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder) would
otherwise be entitled by (b) $20.75. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (k) | _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund delivered to the Exchange Agent by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.03(f)
which remains undistributed to the shareholders of Seller for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any shareholders of Seller who have not
theretofore complied with this Article Two shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Stock Consideration, the
Per Share Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Buyer Share
interest and any dividends or distributions with respect to Buyer Shares, in
each case without interest. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (l) | _No Liability_. None of Buyer, Seller, the Exchange Agent
or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any former holder of Seller
Shares for any payment of the Per Share Stock Consideration, the Per Share
Cash 
---|---|--- 

 



 

11

 



 

    |  | Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Buyer Share
interest or any dividends or distributions with respect to Buyer Shares
delivered to a public official if required by any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. 
---|---|--- 

 



 



 

    _(m) _ | _Withholding Rights_. Buyer or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Seller Certificates such amounts
as Buyer or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other provision of
domestic or foreign (whether national, federal, state, provincial, local or
otherwise) tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate taxing authority by Buyer or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Seller Certificates in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent. 
---|--- 

 



 

    _(n) _ | _Waiver_. __ The Surviving Corporation may from time to
time, in the case of one or more persons, waive one or more of the rights
provided to it in this Article Two to withhold certain payments, deliveries
and distributions; and no such waiver shall constitute a waiver of its rights
thereafter to withhold any such payment, delivery or distribution in the case
of any person. 
---|--- 

 



 

    _(o) _ | _Section 16(a) Exemption._ Prior to the Effective Time,
Buyer and Seller shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
acquisitions of Buyer equity securities (including derivative securities with
respect to any Buyer equity securities) and dispositions of Seller equity
securities (including derivative securities with respect to any Seller equity
securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is anticipated to be subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Buyer or who is subject

 **2.04.** **_Seller Shareholders  Dissenters Rights_**

 



 

Anything contained in this Agreement or elsewhere to the contrary
notwithstanding, if any holder of an outstanding Seller Share who is entitled
to demand and properly demands payment of the " **fair cash value** " of such
Seller Share in accordance with Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (a " **Seller
Dissenting Share** "), then such Seller Dissenting Share shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and instead:

 



 

     | (a) | Each such Seller Dissenting Share shall nevertheless be
deemed to be extinguished at the Effective Time as provided elsewhere in this
Agreement; 
---|---|--- 

 



 

12

 



 



 

     | (b) | Each holder perfecting such dissenters rights shall
thereafter have only such rights (and shall have such obligations) as are
provided in Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be required to deliver any cash payments to such person in substitution
for each such Seller Dissenting Share in accordance with this Agreement;
provided, however, that if any such person shall have failed to perfect or
shall withdraw or lose such holders rights under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL,
each such holders Seller Dissenting Share shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Per
Share Stock Consideration or the Per Share Cash Consideration, as shall have
been designated on the Election Form submitted by such holder prior to the
Election Deadline, or if no such designation shall have been made, the Per
Share Cash Consideration, without any interest thereon, pursuant to Section
2.01 and subject to Section 2.03. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

No holder of a Seller Dissenting Share shall be entitled to submit a letter of
transmittal, and any letter of transmittal submitted by a holder of a Seller
Dissenting Share shall be invalid, unless and until the demand for the payment
of the fair cash value made in respect of such Seller Dissenting Share shall
have been or is deemed to have been withdrawn.

 



 

 **2.05.** **_Anti-Dilution Provisions_**

 



 

In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding Buyer Shares are increased, decreased, changed
into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities (or
Buyer establishes a record date for effecting any such change to the
outstanding Buyer Shares) as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
like changes in Buyers capitalization, the Exchange Ratio and the Per Share
Consideration shall be adjusted fully; _provided, however,_ that nothing
contained herein shall require any adjustment to the Exchange Ratio or the Per
Share Stock Consideration as a result of the issuance of additional Buyer
Shares for consideration which, if such issuance was for more than 19.9% of
the then outstanding Buyer Shares, would not require the approval of the Buyer
shareholders. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to permit any action
which may be proscribed by this Agreement.

 



 

 **2.06.** **_Conversion of WI Sub Capital Stock_**

 



 

Immediately after the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share, and
each share held in the treasury, of capital stock of WI Sub shall, by virtue
of the Bank Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be canceled without any conversion or issuance of any shares of capital stock
of Buyer or WB Sub with respect thereto. No shares of Buyer or WB Sub shall be
issued or exchanged and no consideration shall be given for shares of WI Sub,
and each then-issued and outstanding share, and each share then held in the
treasury, of capital stock of WB Sub shall, by virtue of the Bank Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, continue as one share of
capital stock of the Surviving Bank Corporation having the same designations,
preferences, limitations, and rights as such share of capital stock of WB Sub
immediately prior to the Bank Merger.

failure to file which would not have a material adverse effect upon Seller.
All such filings, at the time of filing, complied in all material respects as
to form and included all exhibits required to be filed under the applicable
rules of the SEC applicable to such Seller SEC Documents. None of such
documents, as subsequently supplemented or amended prior to the date hereof,
when filed, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (h) | _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth
in Seller SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this

condition exists which Seller believes will cause such a material adverse
change in the future; and (b) Seller has not taken or permitted any of the
actions described in Section 5.01(b) of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

 



 



 

     | (j) | _Loan Documentation_. The documentation (" **Loan
Documentation** ") governing or relating to the material loan and credit-
related assets (" **Loan Assets** ") included in the loan portfolio of WI Sub
is legally sufficient for the purposes intended thereby and creates
enforceable rights of WI Sub in accordance in all material respects with the
terms of such Loan Documentation, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent convey-ance and other
similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally, by general equitable principles (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and by an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, except for such
insufficiencies as would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on Seller. Except as set forth in the Seller Filed SEC Documents or in
Section 3.01(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no debtor under any of the
Loan Documentation has asserted as of the date hereof any claim or defense
with respect to the subject matter thereof, which claim or defense, if
determined adversely to Seller, would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Seller. Except as set forth in the Seller SEC
Documents or in Section 3.01(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, WI Sub is
not a party to a loan, including any loan guaranty, with any director,
executive officer or five percent (5%) shareholder of Seller or any of the

controlled by or under common control with either Seller or any of the Seller
Subsidiaries. All loans and extensions of credit that have been made by WI Sub

procedures except for such failures to comply as would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (k) | _Allowance for Loan Losses_. Except as set forth in the
Seller SEC Documents or in Section 3.01(k) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,

of WI Sub on the Seller Financial Statements that (A)(i) is 90 days or more
delinquent or (ii) has been classified by examiners (regulatory or internal)
as "Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss," and (B) the default by the borrower
under which would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Seller. The allowance for loan losses reflected on the Seller Financial
Statements has been determined in accordance with GAAP in all material
respects and in accordance in all material respects with all rules and
regulations applicable to Seller and WI Sub and is, in the 
---|---|--- 

 



 

20

 



 

 judgment of Sellers management, adequate in all material respects, except for such failures and inadequacies which would not reasonably

 

 be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller.

 



 

     | (l) | _Reports and Records_. Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries
have filed all reports and maintained all records required to be filed or
maintained by them under the rules and regulations of the OTS, the Ohio
Division and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (" **FDIC** "), except
for such reports and records the failure to file or maintain would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. All such
documents and reports complied in all material respects with applicable
requirements of law and rules and regulations in effect at the time such
documents and reports were filed and contained in all material respects the
information required to be stated therein, except for such documents and
records the failure to file or contain such information would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. None of such
documents or reports, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, other than such
reports and documents which the failure to file in such fashion would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. 
---|---|---

Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have timely
filed all material returns, statements, reports and forms (including
elections, declarations, disclosures, schedules, estimates and information
returns) (collectively, the " **Tax Returns** ") with respect to all material
federal, state, local and foreign income, gross income, gross receipts, gains,
premium, sales, use, _ad valorem_ , transfer, franchise, profits, withholding,
payroll, employment, excise, severance, stamp, occupancy, license, lease,
environmental, customs, duties, property, windfall profits and all other
material taxes (including any interest, penalties or additions to tax with
respect thereto, individually, a " **Tax** " and, collectively, " **Taxes** ")
required to be filed with the appropriate tax authority through the date of
this Agreement. Such Tax Returns are or will be true, correct and complete in
all material respects. Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have paid and
discharged all Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns, other than such Taxes
that are adequately reserved as shown on the Seller Financial Statements or
have arisen in the ordinary course of business since the Seller Balance Sheet
Date. Except as set forth in Section 3.01(m) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Internal Revenue Service (the " **IRS** ") nor any other
taxing agency or authority, domestic or foreign, has asserted, is now
asserting or, to the knowledge of Seller, is threatening to assert against
Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries any deficiency or claim for
additional Taxes, which deficiency or claim, if upheld, would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. There are no 
---|---|--- 

 



 

21

 



 

 unexpired waivers by Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries of any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes. The accruals and reserves 

 

 for Taxes reflected in the Seller Financial Statements are adequate in all material respects for the periods covered. Seller and the Seller 

 

 Subsidiaries have withheld or collected and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authorities or are properly holding for such 

 

 payment all Taxes required by law to be withheld or collected, except for such failures to withhold or collect as would not reasonably be 

 

 expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary, other 

 

 than liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable and liens that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to 

 

 have a material adverse effect on Seller. Neither Seller nor any of the Seller Subsidiaries has agreed to make, or is required to make, any 

 

 adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code. Except as set forth in the Seller SEC Documents or in Section 3.01(m) of the Seller 

 

 Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted, or 

 

 could result, individually or in the aggregate, in the payment of "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the 

 

 Code. Neither Seller nor any of the Seller Subsidiaries has ever been a member of an affiliated group of corporations, within the meaning of 

 

 Section 1504 of the Code, other than an affiliated group of which Seller is or was the common buyer corporation. No Tax is required to be 

 

 withheld pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

     | (n) | _Property and Title_. Section 3.01(n) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule lists and describes all real property, and any leasehold
interest in real property, owned or held by Seller or any of the Seller
Subsidiaries and used in the business of Seller or any of the Seller
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " **Seller Real Properties** "). The Seller
Real Properties constitute all of the material real property and interests in
real property used in the businesses of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries.
Copies of all leases of Seller Real Properties to which Seller or any of the
Seller Subsidiaries is a party have been provided to Buyer. Such leasehold
interests have not been assigned or subleased. All Seller Real Properties
which are owned by Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries are free and clear
of all mortgages, liens, security interests, defects, encumbrances, easements,
restrictions, reservations, conditions, covenants, agreements, encroachments,
rights of way and zoning laws, except (i) those set forth in the Seller SEC
Documents or Section 3.01(n) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule; (ii)
easements, restrictions, reservations, conditions, covenants, rights of way,
zoning laws and other defects and irregularities in title and encumbrances
which do not materially impair the use thereof for the purposes for which they
are held; (iii) the lien of current taxes not yet due and payable and (iv)
other defects in title, easements, restrictive covenants and similar
encumbrances that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably 
---|---|--- 

 



 

22

 



 

 be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries own, and are in rightful possession of, and have 

 

 good title to, all of the other assets indicated in the Seller SEC Documents as being owned by Seller or the Seller Subsidiaries, free and

    |  | described in Code §401(a) benefiting (or intended to benefit)
themselves or persons who are not Employees or (B) by persons or entities who

Seller Subsidiaries has any commitment to create any additional Compensation
and Benefit Plan or to modify or change any existing Compensation and Benefit

Sections 6.02 and 7.01 **** of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

    | (ii) | Each Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and
administered substantially in accordance with its terms and with applicable
law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act (as
defined in Section 5.05(a)) the Exchange Act (as defined in Section 3.01(g)),
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or any regulations or rules

ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely made, except
with respect to such failures as would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Seller. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan which is
an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
(a " **Seller** **Pension** **Plan** ") and which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS and Seller is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter. There is no material
pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened legal action, suit or claim
relating to the Compensation and Benefit Plans other than routine claims for
benefits thereunder. Neither Seller nor any of the Seller Subsidiaries has
engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any
Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject
Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either

Section 4975 of the Code that the taxable period of any such transaction

respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained
by any of them, or any single-employer plan of any entity (a " **Seller**
**ERISA** **Affiliate Plan** ") which is considered one employer with Seller
under

    |  | Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of
the Code (a " **Seller** **ERISA Affiliate** "). None of Seller, the Seller
Subsidiaries nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or has been
obligated to contribute, to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV
of ERISA (as defined in ERISA Sections 3(37)(A) and 4001(a)(3)) at any time
since September 26, 1980. No notice of a "reportable event", within the
meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the 30-day reporting requirement
has not been waived, has been required to be filed for any Compensation and
Benefit Plan or by any Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan within the 12-month period
ending on the date hereof, and no such notice will be required to be filed as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA
Affiliate Plan and, to Sellers knowledge, no condition exists that presents a
material risk that such proceedings will be instituted. There is no pending
investigation or enforcement action by the PBGC, the DOL, the IRS or any other
Governmental Authority with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan.

of the most recent actuarial valuation performed prior to the date of this
Agreement, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such
actuarial valuation of such Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate
Plan), did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Seller
Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan and since such date there has been
neither an adverse change in the financial condition of such Seller Pension
Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any amendment or other change to such
Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan that would increase the
amount of benefits thereunder which reasonably could be expected to change
such result and that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (iv) | All contributions required to be made under the terms of
any Compensation and Benefit Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan or any
employee benefit arrangements under any collective bargaining agreement to
which Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries is a party have been timely
made or have been reflected on the Seller Financial Statements. Neither any
Seller Pension Plan nor any Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan has an "accumulated
funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and all required payments to the PBGC with
respect to each Seller Pension Plan or Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan have been
made on or

 reasonably be expected to be required to provide, security to any Seller Pension Plan or to any Seller ERISA Affiliate Plan 

 

 pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, and (y) has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, that has resulted, or 

 

 would reasonably be expected to result, in the imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA that 

 

 individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Seller.

Plan.

on Section 3.01(t)(viii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would not, directly or

---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (k) | [Reserved] 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (l) | _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth
in Buyer SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " **Buyer Filed SEC Documents** ") (including the financial
statements included therein) or in Section 4.01(l) of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule 
---|---|--- 

 



 

38

 



 

 and except as arising hereunder, Buyer and its subsidiaries (individually " **Buyer Subsidiary** " or collectively " **Buyer Subsidiaries** ") have 

 

 no liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) at the Buyer Balance Sheet Date, other than 

 

 liabilities and obligations that individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. 

 

 Except as set forth in the Buyer Filed SEC Documents or otherwise disclosed in Section 4.01(l) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, all 

 

 debts, liabilities, guarantees and obligations of Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries incurred since the Buyer Balance Sheet Date have been 

 

 incurred in the ordinary course of business and are usual and normal in amount both individually and in the aggregate. 

 



 

     | (m) | _Absence of Changes_. Except (i) as set forth in the Buyer
Filed SEC Documents, (ii) as set forth in Section 4.01(m) of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, or (iii) in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, since the Buyer Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any
material adverse change in the business, operations, assets or financial
condition of Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries taken as a whole, and, to the
knowledge of Buyer, no fact or condition exists which Buyer believes will
cause such a material adverse change in the future. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (n) | _Allowance for Loan Losses_. Except as set forth in the
Buyer SEC Documents or in Section 3.01(n) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule,
there is no loan which was made by any Buyer Subsidiary and which is reflected
as an asset of such Buyer Subsidiary on the Buyer Financial Statements that
(A)(i) is 90 days or more delinquent or (ii) has been classified by examiners
(regulatory or internal) as "Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss," and (B) the
default by the borrower under which could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Buyer. The allowance for loan losses reflected on
the Buyer Financial Statements has been determined in accordance with GAAP in
all material respects and in accordance in all material respects with all
rules and regulations applicable to Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries and is,
in the judgment of Buyers management, adequate in all material respects,
except for such failures and inadequacies which would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Buyer has considered all
potential losses known to Buyer in establishing the current allowance for loan
losses for each Buyer Subsidiary, other than such losses that if incurred
would not have a material adverse effect on Buyer. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (o) | _Reports and Records_. Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries
have filed all reports and maintained all records required to be filed or
maintained by them under the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC and the West Virginia Division of

 Buyer. All such documents and reports complied in all material respects with applicable requirements of law and rules and regulations in 

 

 effect at the time such documents and reports were filed and contained in all material respects the information required to be stated therein, 

 

 except for such documents and records the failure to file or contain such information would not reasonably be expected to have a material 

 

 adverse effect on Buyer. None of such documents or reports, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to 

 

 state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under 

 

 which they were made, not misleading, other than such reports and documents which the failure to file in such fashion would not

Buyer Disclosure Schedule, Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries have timely filed
all material Tax Returns with respect to all material Taxes required to be

respects. Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries have paid and discharged all Taxes
shown as due on such Tax Returns, other than such Taxes that are adequately
reserved as shown on the Buyer Financial Statements or have arisen in the
ordinary course of business since the Buyer Balance Sheet Date. Except as set
forth in Section 4.01(p) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, neither the IRS nor
any other taxing agency or authority, domestic or foreign, has asserted, is
now asserting or, to the knowledge of Buyer, is threatening to assert against
Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary any deficiency or claim for additional Taxes,
which deficiency or claim, if upheld, would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Buyer. There are no unexpired waivers by Buyer or
any Buyer Subsidiary of any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes. The
accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in the Buyer Financial Statements
are adequate in all material respects for the periods covered. Buyer and the
Buyer Subsidiaries have withheld or collected and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities or are properly holding for such payment all Taxes
required by law to be withheld or collected, except for such failures to
withhold or collect as would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on Buyer. There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of Buyer
or any Buyer Subsidiary, other than liens for current Taxes not yet due and
payable and liens that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Neither Buyer nor any
Buyer Subsidiary has agreed to make, or is required to make, any adjustment
under Section 481(a) of the Code. Except as set forth in the Buyer SEC
Documents or in Section 4.01(p) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, neither
Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary is a party to any agreement, contract,
arrangement or plan that has resulted, or could result, individually or in the
aggregate, in the

 result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

     | (q) | _Legal Proceedings_. Except as set forth in the Buyer Filed
SEC Documents or Section 4.01(q) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, there are

any governmental agency or instrumentality or in any arbitration proceeding
(i) against Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary which, if adversely determined
against Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary, could have a material adverse effect on
Buyer; or (ii) against or by Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary which, if adversely
determined against Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary, could prevent the

or declare the same to be unlawful or cause the rescission thereof. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (r) | _Regulatory Matters._ Except as set forth in Section

of understanding or similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or
similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory letter from, any
Regulatory Authorities that individually or in the aggregate could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. Neither Buyer nor any
Buyer Subsidiary has been advised by any Regulatory Authority that such
Regulatory Authority is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering
the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, judgment,
decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, supervisory
letter or similar submission that individually or in the aggregate could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer.

 maintained or contributed to (currently or within the last six years) by (A) Buyer or any subsidiary of Buyer and in which any 

 

 employee or former employee (the " **Buyer Employees** "), consultant or former consultant (the __ " **Buyer Consultants** "), officer or 

 

 former officer (the " **Buyer Officers** "), or director or former director (the " **Buyer Directors** ") of Buyer or any subsidiary of 

 

 Buyer participates or to which any such Buyer Employees, Buyer Consultants, Buyer Officers or Buyer Directors either participate 

 

 or are parties or (B) any Buyer ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) (collectively, the " **Buyer Compensation and Benefit**

 

 ** Plans**"). Neither Buyer
nor any subsidiary of Buyer has any commitment to create any additional Buyer
Compensation and Benefit

 

 Plan or to modify or change any existing Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan, except to the extent required by law and as 

 

 otherwise contemplated by Sections 6.02 and 7.01 **** of this Agreement.

 



 

     | (ii) | Except in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect, each Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan has
been operated and administered in accordance with its terms and with
applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities
Act (as defined in Section 3.01(u)), the Exchange Act (as defined in Section
3.01(g)), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or any regulations or
rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and notices
required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely
made. Each Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " **Buyer**
**Pension Plan** ") and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter (including a
determination that the related trust under such Buyer Compensation and Benefit
Plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) from the IRS and
Buyer is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter. There is no material pending or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, threatened legal action, suit or claim relating to the
Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plans other than routine claims for benefits
thereunder. Neither Buyer nor any subsidiary of Buyer has engaged in a
transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject
Buyer or any subsidiary of Buyer to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for purposes of Section
4975 of the Code that the taxable period of any such transaction expired as of
the date hereof. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

42

 



 

     | (iii) | No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the
PBGC which have been made or will be made on a timely basis) under Title IV of
ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Buyer or any subsidiary of
Buyer with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer
plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or
formerly maintained by any of them, or any single-employer plan of any entity
(a " **Buyer** **ERISA Affiliate Plan** ") which is considered one employer
with Buyer under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of
the Code (a " **Buyer** **ERISA Affiliate** "). None of Buyer, any subsidiary
of Buyer or any Buyer ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or has been obligated
to contribute, to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA
(as defined in ERISA Sections 3(37)(A) and 4001(a)(3)) at any time since
September 26, 1980. No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA, for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been
waived, has been required to be filed for any Buyer Compensation and Benefit
Plan or by any Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan within the 12-month period ending on
the date hereof, and no such notice will be required to be filed as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA
Affiliate Plan and, to Buyers knowledge, no condition exists that presents a
material risk that such proceedings will be instituted. There is no pending
investigation or enforcement action by the PBGC, the DOL, the IRS or any other
Governmental Authority with respect to any Buyer Compensation and Benefit
Plan. Except as disclosed in Section 4.01(r)(iii) of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, under each Buyer Pension Plan and Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of
the date of the most recent actuarial valuation performed prior to the date of
this Agreement, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such
actuarial valuation of such Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan),
did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Buyer Pension Plan
or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan and since such date there has been neither an
adverse change in the financial condition of such Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer
ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any amendment or other change to such Buyer Pension
Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan that would increase the amount of benefits
thereunder which reasonably could be expected to change such result. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (iv) | All contributions required to be made under the terms of
any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan or any
employee benefit arrangements under any collective 
---|---|--- 

 



 

43

 



 

    |  | bargaining agreement to which Buyer or any subsidiary of Buyer
is a party have been timely made or have been reflected on the Buyer Financial
Statements. Neither any Buyer Pension Plan nor any Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan
has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the
meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and all required
payments to the PBGC with respect to each Buyer Pension Plan and each Buyer
ERISA Affiliate Plan have been made on or before their due dates. None of
Buyer, the any subsidiary of Buyer nor any Buyer ERISA Affiliate (x) has
provided, or would reasonably be expected to be required to provide, security
to any Buyer Pension Plan or to any Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to
Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, and (y) has taken any action, or omitted to
take any action, that has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result,
in the imposition of a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to
ERISA. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (v) | Except as disclosed in Section 4.01(s)(v) of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, neither Buyer nor any subsidiary of Buyer has any
obligations to provide retiree health and life insurance or other retiree
death benefits under any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than

Schedule, Seller will promptly deliver to Buyer a supplement to the Seller
Disclosure Schedule specifying such change (" **Updated Seller Disclosure
Schedule** "); provided, however, that the disclosure of such change in the
Updated Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute a cure of

respect of any of Sellers covenants contained in this

 **5.03.** **_Acquisition Proposals_**

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until this Agreement has been terminated as
provided herein, Seller shall not, nor shall it permit any of the Seller
Subsidiaries to, or authorize or permit any director, officer or employee of
Seller or any of the Seller Subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney,
accountant or other advisor or representative of Seller or any of its
subsidiaries (the " **Seller Representatives** ") to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any Takeover Proposal (as defined
below) or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with respect to, any Takeover Proposal;
_provided, however_ , that at any time prior to obtaining the approval of its
shareholders, the Board of Directors of Seller or Seller Representatives may,
in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal which was unsolicited and
did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.03, and subject to
compliance with Section 5.03(c) and (d), may take the following actions if the
Board of Directors, after consultation with and based upon the advice of
counsel, determines that such actions are required to fulfill its fiduciary
duties under applicable laws: (x) furnish information with respect to Seller
and its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement, provided
that all such information is provided to Buyer or has been previously provided
to Buyer, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person
making such Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal.

 



 

The term " **Takeover Proposal** " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any person relating to, or that is reasonably likely to lead to, any direct or
indirect acquisition, in one transaction or a series of transactions,
including any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock
acquisition, asset acquisition, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or similar
transaction, of (A) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 20% or
more of the total revenue or assets of Seller and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (B) 20% or more of the outstanding Seller Shares, or other equity or
voting interests in, any of Sellers Subsidiaries directly or indirectly
holding, individually or taken together, the assets or businesses referred to
in clause (A) above, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of Seller nor any committee thereof
shall, unless the Board of Directors or a committee thereof determines in good
faith, after consulting with legal counsel, that the failure to take any such
action set forth in this Section 5.03(b) would be reasonably likely to result
in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable laws (i) (A) withdraw (or
modify in a manner adverse to Buyer) the recommendation by such Board of
Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger, (B) determine
that this Agreement or the Merger is no longer advisable, (C) recommend that
the shareholders of Seller reject this Agreement or the Merger, (D) recommend
the approval or adoption of any Takeover Proposal or (E) resolve, agree or
propose publicly to take any such actions, (ii) adopt or approve

 



 

53

 



 

any Takeover Proposal, or withdraw its approval of this Agreement, or resolve
or agree to take any such actions, (iii) without limiting Section 5.03(b)(i),
propose publicly to adopt or approve any Takeover Proposal or propose publicly
to withdraw its approval of this Agreement, or resolve or agree to take any
such actions, or (iv) cause or permit Seller to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement (each, an " **Acquisition Agreement**
") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely
to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 5.03(a)), or resolve or agree to take any such actions.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.03 to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the shareholder approval, the Board of Directors of Seller
may, in response to a Superior Proposal and that did not result from a breach
of Section 5.03(a), cause Seller to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11.01(d)(iii) and concurrently enter into a binding Acquisition
Agreement containing the terms of a Superior Proposal; _provided, however,_
that Seller shall not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 11.01(d)(iii) until after the third business day following Buyers
receipt of written notice (a " **Notice of Superior Proposal** ") from Seller
advising Buyer that the Board of Directors of Seller has received a Superior
Proposal and that such Board of Directors intends to, subject to any action
taken by Buyer pursuant to this sentence, cause Seller to accept such Superior
Proposal and terminate this Agreement, specifying the terms and conditions of
the Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the price or any other
material term of a Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and a new three business day period).

 



 

The term " **Superior Proposal** " means any bona fide binding written offer
not solicited by or on behalf of Seller and received subsequent to the date
hereof made by a third party that if consummated would result in such third
party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and Seller,
the stockholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more
than 50% of the voting power of Seller or all or substantially all the assets
of Seller and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that the Board of Directors
of Seller determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its
financial advisor or other financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) is reasonably likely to result in terms which are more favorable
from a financial point of view to Sellers shareholders than the Merger,
taking into account, among other things, any changes to the terms of this
Agreement offered by Buyer in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of Seller set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 5.03, Seller promptly shall, but in any case within 24
hours, advise Buyer in writing of any request for information that Seller
reasonably believes could lead to or contemplates a Takeover Proposal or of
any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry Seller reasonably believes could lead to
any Takeover Proposal, the terms and conditions of such request, Takeover
Proposal or inquiry (including any subsequent material amendment or
modification to such terms and conditions) and the identity of the person
making any such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry. Seller shall keep Buyer
informed in all material respects on a timely basis of the status and details
(including material amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request,
Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

 



 

54

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit Seller from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to Sellers shareholders if, in the

     | (a) | Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to

the Seller Subsidiaries after the Merger. Employees of Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries (other than employees who are otherwise parties to employment or
change in control agreements) (i) who are not offered the opportunity to
continue as employees following the Effective Time or (ii) who are terminated
without cause within six months after the Effective Time, shall be entitled to

employees at will under Ohio law and said employees shall not be deemed to be
third-party beneficiaries of this provision. From and after the Effective
Time, the Employees of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries who remain employees
of Buyer or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (including employees who
are parties to employment or change in control agreements) (" **Continuing
Employees** ") shall be provided with employee benefits that do not
discriminate between employees who were covered by the Seller Compensation and
Benefit Plans and employees who were covered by the Buyer Compensation and
Benefit plans. Each Continuing Employee shall be credited with years of
service with Seller, the appropriate Seller Subsidiary and, to the extent
credit would have been given by Seller or the appropriate Seller Subsidiary
for years of service with a predecessor (including any business organization
acquired by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary), years of service with a
predecessor of Seller or a Seller Subsidiary, for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (but not for benefit accrual purposes) in the employee benefit plans
of Buyer, and shall not be subject to any exclusion or penalty for pre-
existing conditions that were covered under the Seller Compensation and
Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, or to any waiting
period relating to such coverage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all then
active Seller 
---|---|--- 

 



 

56

 



 

 Employees and all then active Seller Subsidiary Employees shall commence participation in Buyers Employee Stock Ownership Plan and 

 

 its Defined Benefit Pension Plan as of the Effective Time. The foregoing covenants shall survive the Merger, and Buyer shall before the 

 

 Effective Time adopt resolutions that amend its tax-qualified retirement plans to provide for the Seller or Seller Subsidiary service credits 

 

 referenced herein.

 



 

     | (b) | The Surviving Corporation shall cause WB Sub to honor the
terms of each of the employment agreements as in effect at the Seller
Subsidiaries, as of the date hereof, in accordance with their terms after the
Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or elsewhere, Robert L. Bollin, Gregory J. Bollin,
Jill M. Burke, Robert J. Booth and Gregory P. Niesen shall receive,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the severance payment to which each
is entitled in accordance with the terms of their employment or severance
agreements upon a "Change of Control" as defined therein. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (c) | Seller and Buyer shall create a retention bonus pool from

 **6.03.** **_Exchange Listing_**

 



 

Buyer shall file a listing application with Nasdaq for the Buyer Shares to be
issued to the former holders of Seller Shares in the Merger at the time
prescribed by applicable Nasdaq rules and regulations, and shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer Shares to be issued in
connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date. In addition, Buyer
will use its best efforts to maintain its listing on Nasdaq.

 



 

 **6.04.** **_Notification_**

 



 

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer promptly shall
notify Seller in writing if Buyer becomes aware of any fact or condition that
(i) causes or constitutes a breach in any material respect of any of Buyers
or WB Subs representations and warranties or (ii) would (except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach in any material
respect of any such representation or warranty had such representation or
warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or
condition. Should any such fact or condition require any change in the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, Buyer promptly shall deliver to Seller a supplement to
the Buyer Disclosure Schedule specifying such change (" **Updated Buyer
Disclosure Schedule** "); provided, however, that the disclosure of such
change in the Updated Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to
constitute a cure of any breach of any representation or warranty made
pursuant to this Agreement unless consented to in writing by Seller. During
the same period, Buyer promptly shall notify Seller of (i) the occurrence of
any breach in any material respect of any of Buyers or WB Subs covenants
contained in this Agreement, (ii) the occurrence of any event that may

 



 

57

 



 

make the satisfaction of the conditions in this Agreement impossible or
unlikely in any material respect or (iii) the occurrence of any event that is
reasonably likely, individually or taken with all other facts, events or
circumstances known to Buyer, to result in a material adverse effect with
respect to Buyer.

 



 

 **6.05** ** _._** **_Takeover Laws_**

 



 

Buyer shall take all necessary steps to (a) exempt (or cause the continued
exemption of) this Agreement, the Merger and the Bank Merger from the

Incorporation and Bylaws, as applicable, by action of the Board of Directors
of Buyer or otherwise, and (b) assist in any challenge by Seller to the
validity, or applicability to the Merger or Bank Merger, of any Takeover Law.

     | (a) | For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time,
Buyer shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the Code of
Regulations of Seller, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
Director or Officer of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary (each, an "
**Indemnified** **Party** " _)_ against all costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, " **Costs** ") __ incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
adminis-trative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby),
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time;
_provided_ that any determination required to be made with respect to whether
an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards set forth under
applicable law for indemnification shall be made by the court in which the
claim, action, suit or proceeding was brought or by independent counsel (which
shall not be counsel that provides material services to Buyer) selected by
Buyer and reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (b) | If Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any person or (iii) transfers, by means of a distribution, sale,
assignment or other transaction, all of the stock of the Surviving Corporation
or all or substantially all of its assets, to any person, then, and in each
such case, Buyer shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successor
and assign of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set
forth in this Section and in such event all references to the 
---|---|--- 

 



 

58

 



 

 the Surviving Corporation in this Section shall be deemed a reference to such successor and assign.

 



 

     | (c) | For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Buyer
shall provide that portion of directors and officers liability insurance
that serves to reimburse the present and former Officers and Directors of
Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) (as
opposed to Seller) with respect to claims against such Officers and Directors
arising from facts or events which occurred before the Effective Time, on
terms no less favorable than those in effect on the date hereof; _provided,
however_ , that Buyer may substitute therefor policies providing at least
comparable coverage containing terms and conditions no less favorable than
those in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ that in no event
shall Buyer be required to expend more than 250% of the current amount
expended by Seller (the " **Insurance Amount** ") to maintain or procure such
directors and officers liability insurance coverage; _provided, further_
that if Buyer is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this
Section 6.06(c), Buyer shall obtain as much comparable insurance as, in the
good faith judgment of the Surviving Corporations board, is available for the
Insurance Amount. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (d) | Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 6.06(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify Buyer thereof; _provided_
that the failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of Buyer under
Section 6.06(a) unless and to the extent that Buyer is actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (e) | The provisions of this Section 6.06 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will
be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives. The Surviving Corporation shall pay (as incurred) all
expenses, including reasonable expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Party
may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in
this Section 6.06.

Board of Directors of WB Sub at the first meeting of such board held after the
Effective Time. The appointee to the Board of Directors of Buyer shall serve

for their service on the Board of Directors of Seller. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, any Director of Seller who did not receive
director fees from Seller shall receive advisory board fees from Buyer
provided such director is not then an employee of Buyer or Buyer Sub. 
---|--- 

 



 

 **6.08.** **_Operation of Business_**

 



 

 Buyers business, and the business of each of the Buyer Subsidiaries, will be conducted only in the ordinary and usual course consistent with past practice. Without the written consent of Seller which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, Buyer shall not, and shall cause each of the Buyer Subsidiaries not to, take any action which would be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Buyer or on the Surviving Corporation or except, in each case, as may be required by applicable law or regulation.

---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (i) | at any time after March 31, 2005, if the Merger shall not

the Merger is not caused by a breach of this Agreement by the terminating
party; 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (ii) | if the shareholders of Seller shall not have adopted this
Agreement by reason of the failure to obtain the requisite vote upon a vote
held at a Seller Meeting, or any adjournment thereof; or

     | (c) | By Buyer by providing written notice to Seller: 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (i) | if prior to the Closing Date, any representation and
warranty of Seller shall have become untrue such that the condition set forth

within ten business days following receipt by Seller of written notice of
breach or is incapable of being cured during such time period; or 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (ii) | if Seller shall have failed to comply in any material

Agreement required to be complied with prior to the date of such termination,
which failure to comply shall not have been cured within ten business days
following receipt by Seller of written notice of such failure to comply or is
incapable of being cured during such time period. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (d) | By Seller by providing written notice to Buyer: 
---|---|--- 

 



 

70

 



 

     | (i) | if prior to the Closing Date, any representation and
warranty of Buyer or WB Sub shall have become untrue such that the condition
set forth at Section 8.02(a) would not be satisfied and which breach has not
been cured within ten business days following receipt by Buyer of written
notice of breach or is incapable of being cured during such time period; 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (ii) | if Buyer or WB Sub shall have failed to comply in any

---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (iii) | by Seller following receipt of a Superior Proposal subject

     | (iv) | this Agreement may be terminated any time prior to Closing

ending two days before the Effective Time (the " **Walkaway Right** "), if: 
---|---|---

     | (2) | (a) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing
Price (as defined below) by the Starting Price (such number being referred to
herein as the " **Buyer Ratio** ") shall be less than (b) the number obtained
by dividing the Index Price (as defined below) on the Walkaway Determination
Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date (as defined below) and
subtracting 0.15 from such quotient; 
---|---|--- 

 



 

subject to the following. If Seller elects to exercise its termination right
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt written
notice to Buyer; provided that such notice of election to terminate may be
withdrawn by Seller at any time within the aforementioned five-day period.
During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Buyer
shall have the option of increasing the Exchange Ratio in a manner such that
the conditions set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above shall be deemed not to
exist (the " **Top-up Notice** ). For purposes hereof, the condition set forth
in clause (1) above shall be deemed not to exist if the Exchange Ratio and/or
the Per Share Cash Consideration is increased so that the Per Share
Consideration (as defined below) after such increase is not less than the Per
Share

 



 

71

 



 



 

Consideration that would have been in effect if the condition set forth in
clause (1) above did not exist. For purposes hereof, the condition set forth
in clause (2) above shall be deemed not to exist if the Exchange Ratio is
increased so that the Per Share Consideration after such increase is not less
than the Per Share Consideration that would have been in effect if the
condition set forth in clause (2) above did not exist. If Buyer makes this
election, within such five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to
Seller of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 11.01(d)(v) and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the
Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified), and any references in this
Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the
Exchange Ratio after giving effect to any adjustment made pursuant to this
Section 11.01(d)(v). For purposes of this Section 11.01(d)(v), the following
terms shall have the following meanings:

 



 

     |  | " **Average Closing Price"** means the average of the last
reported sale prices per share of the Buyer Shares as reported on the Nasdaq

another mutually agreed upon authoritative source) for the 20 consecutive
trading days ending seven calendar days before the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     |  | **"Walkaway Determination Date"** shall mean the date which is
seven calendar days prior to the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     |  | " **Index Price** " on a given date means the closing value of
the Nasdaq Bank Index as reported on Bloomberg.com, or if not reported
therein, in another mutually agreed upon authoritative source. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     |  | " **Per Share Consideration** " shall mean the Exchange Ratio
multiplied by the Average Closing Price. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     |  | " **Starting Price** " shall mean last reported sale prices per
share of Buyer Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq (as reported in The Wall
Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another mutually agreed upon
authoritative source) on the Starting Date. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     |  | " **Starting Date** " shall mean the last full trading day
prior to the announcement by press release of the Merger or, if such
announcement occurs after the close of trading on any trading day, such
trading day. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

72

 



 

If Buyer declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, non-acquisitive exchange of shares or
similar transaction between the Starting Date and the Walkaway Determination
Date (or establishes a record date in respect thereof), the prices for the
common stock of Buyer shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of
applying this Section 11.01(d)(v).

 



 

 **11.02.** **_Effect of Termination_**

 



 

     | (a) | If this Agreement is validly terminated by either Seller or
Buyer pursuant to Section 11.01, this Agreement will forthwith become null and
void and there will be no liability or obligation on the part of either Seller
or Buyer, except (i) that the provisions of Sections 5.03, 7.05, 7.06 and
12.07 and this Article XI will continue to apply following any such
termination, (ii) that nothing contained herein shall relieve any party hereto
from liability for breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement and (iii) as provided in paragraph (b)
below. 
---|---|--- 

 



 

     | (b) | Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer a termination fee of
$3,000,000 in immediately available federal funds if Seller or WI Sub enters
into any agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal prior to the
termination of this Agreement or after the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(iii) and before the date that is twelve months
after the date of termination of this Agreement.
