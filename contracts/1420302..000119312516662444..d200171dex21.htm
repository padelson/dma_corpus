4 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 26, 2016, among Citrix Systems,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Citrix"), GetGo, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and wholly-owned subsidiary of Citrix ("SpinCo"), LogMeIn, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and Lithium Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub").

WHEREAS, Citrix, directly and indirectly, is engaged in the SpinCo Business
and its other businesses;

WHEREAS, SpinCo is a recently-formed, wholly-owned direct subsidiary of
Citrix;

WHEREAS, on or prior to the Closing Date, Citrix will complete the
reorganization of the SpinCo Business, and following the reorganization of
the SpinCo Business and prior to the Effective Time, and upon the terms and
conditions set forth in the Separation Agreement, Citrix will either (a)
distribute, without consideration, all of the then outstanding shares of
SpinCos common stock, $0.01 par value per share ("SpinCo Common Stock"), to
holders of Citrixs common stock, $0.001 par value per share ("Citrix Common
Stock"), by way of a _pro rata_ dividend (the "One-Step Spin-Off"), or (b)
consummate an offer to exchange shares of SpinCo Common Stock, for currently
issued and outstanding shares of Citrix Common Stock (such offer to exchange
shares, the "Exchange Offer") and, in the event that Citrix stockholders
subscribe for less than all of the shares of SpinCo Common Stock in the
Exchange Offer, distribute, without consideration and _pro rata_ to holders of
Citrix Common Stock, any unsubscribed SpinCo Common Stock on the Distribution
Date immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer so that
Citrix may be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as having
distributed all of the SpinCo Common Stock to its stockholders (the "Clean-Up
Spin-Off");

WHEREAS, the disposition by Citrix of the SpinCo Common Stock to Citrix
stockholders, whether by way of the One-Step Spin-Off or the Exchange Offer
(followed by any Clean-Up Spin-Off, if necessary), is referred to as the
"Distribution";

 

WHEREAS, at the Effective Time, the parties hereto will effect the merger of
Merger Sub with and into SpinCo (the "Merger"), with SpinCo continuing as the
surviving corporation, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes,
(a) the contribution (as part of the Separation) by Citrix of all of its
ownership interests in the SpinCo Assets to SpinCo in exchange for additional
SpinCo Common Stock and SpinCos assumption of the SpinCo Liabilities (the
"Contribution") and the Distribution, taken together, will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and
that each of Citrix and SpinCo will be a "party to a reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, (b) the Distribution, as such,
will qualify as a distribution of the SpinCo Common Stock to Citrixs
stockholders pursuant to Section 355 of the Code and as a transaction in which
the stock distributed thereby is "qualified property" for purposes of
Sections 355(d), 355(e) and 361(c) of the Code, (c) the Merger will not cause
Section 355(e) of the Code to apply to the Distribution, and (d) the Merger
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code and that each of Parent, Merger Sub and SpinCo will be a "party to a
reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code;

 

WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend this Agreement to be, and hereby adopt this
Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent (the "Parent Board") (a) has
determined that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable and has approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger
and the Parent Share Issuance, and will approve the Parent Charter Amendment
as contemplated by this Agreement; and (b) has recommended the approval by the
stockholders of Parent of the Parent Share Issuance and will recommend the
approval by the stockholders of Parent of the Parent Charter Amendment;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has determined that the Merger
and this Agreement are advisable and has approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger; WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of SpinCo (the "SpinCo Board") has determined
that the Merger and this Agreement are advisable and has approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Citrix (the "Citrix Board") has approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger; and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Citrix and SpinCo entering into
this Agreement, Citrix and a stockholder of Parent have entered into a Voting
Agreement pursuant to which such stockholder of Parent has agreed to vote all
shares of Parent Common Stock directly or indirectly held by such stockholder
in favor of the Parent Share Issuance and the Parent Charter Amendment.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

serving as a member of the Parent Board, then Citrix may designate a
replacement individual satisfactory to the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee of the Parent Board (a "Replacement Citrix Board Designee") and the
Parent Board shall promptly appoint such Replacement Citrix Board Designee to
fill the vacancy created thereby. In connection with the first annual meeting
of stockholders of Parent occurring after the Effective Time, the Parent
Board shall, subject to the reasonable exercise of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, take all such action as may be necessary to include the Citrix
Board Designees and/or Replacement Citrix Board Designees in such class up
for re-election as a nominee recommended by the Parent Board for election by
Parents stockholders and shall use no less rigorous efforts to support the
election of each such Citrix Board Designee or Replacement Citrix Board
Designee at such annual meeting than the manner in which Parent supports all
other nominees of the Parent Board.

(b) The Parent Board shall take all such action as may be necessary to cause
each of the Audit Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee, the Compensation Committee and any other standing committees of the
Parent Board to include at least one (1) Citrix Board Designee as of
immediately following the Effective Time (subject, to the extent required by
the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, to qualification of such Citrix Designees to
serve on such Committees).

 

(c) The Parent Board shall take all such action as may be necessary to cause
the Parent Board to establish an Operating Committee of the Parent Board (the
"Operating Committee") as of immediately following the Effective Time. The
Operating Committee shall have a mandate to design and oversee a plan to
achieve the synergies expected to result from the Merger and undertake such
other activities related thereto as may be delegated in accordance with
applicable Law by the Parent Board, and shall be empowered to hire, compensate
and direct the work of third-party advisors to assist therewith, with funding
for such third-party advisors to be provided by Parent. The Operating
Committee shall be composed of four (4) members reasonably agreed upon by
Parent and Citrix, consisting of two (2) Citrix Board Designees and two (2)
current members of the Parent Board. If any of the Citrix Board Designees is
unable or unwilling to serve or is otherwise no longer serving as a member of
the Operating Committee, then the Parent Board shall promptly appoint another
Citrix Board Designee (or Replacement Citrix Board Designee) to fill the
vacancy created thereby. For a period of two (2) years following the Closing
Date, (x) the size of the Operating Committee shall not be increased by the
Parent Board and (y) the Operating Committee shall not be disbanded by the
Parent Board, in each case without the consent of the Citrix Board Designees
and/or Replacement Citrix Board Designees then serving on the Operating
Committee. At the second anniversary of the Closing Date, unless the Parent
Board acts to extend the existence of the Operating Committee, the Operating
Committee shall automatically be disbanded and shall cease to exist as a
committee of the Parent Board.

 

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
Parent shall consult with, and consider the views of, Citrix regarding the
roles and responsibilities of members of management of the SpinCo Business in
the management of Parent and the Surviving Corporation following the Effective
Time.

 

ARTICLE III

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

Section 3.01 _Exchange Fund_. __

 

(b) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Citrix shall designate a
nationally-recognized commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to Parent to act as agent (the "Exchange

 



20  Agent") for the benefit of the holders of Shares who exchange their Shares
in accordance with this _Article III_. Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ promptly after the
Effective Time, book-entry shares representing the Merger Consideration
issuable to holders of Shares as of the Effective Time pursuant to _Section
2.04(a)_ (such book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_
and other amounts payable in accordance with _Section 3.01(e)_, the
"Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions from Parent, deliver the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange
Fund. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) no such investment of or
losses thereon shall relieve Parent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, or affect the amount payable
in respect of the Shares, and following any losses Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent in the amount of any such
losses, and (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent
or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest or other
income from such investments shall be paid to and become income of Parent.
Except as contemplated by _Section 3.01(g)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than as specified in this _Section 3.01(a)_.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to distribute the shares of Parent
Common Stock into which the shares of SpinCo Common Stock that were
distributed in the Distribution have been converted pursuant to the Merger,
which shares shall be distributed on the same basis as the shares of SpinCo
Common Stock were distributed in the Distribution and to the Persons who
received SpinCo Common Stock in the Distribution. Each Person entitled
to receive SpinCo Common Stock in the Distribution shall be entitled to
receive in respect of the shares of SpinCo Common Stock distributed to such
Person a book-entry authorization representing the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this _Section 3.01(b)_ (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, as contemplated by _Section 3.01(e)_) (and any dividends or
distributions and other amounts pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_). The Exchange
Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with
respect to Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except
as contemplated by  _Section 3.01(c)_.

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Undistributed Shares of Parent Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid with respect to any shares
of Parent Common Stock that are not able to be distributed by the Exchange
Agent promptly after the Effective Time, whether due to a legal impediment to
such distribution or otherwise. Subject to the effect of abandoned property,
escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following the distribution of any such
previously undistributed shares of Parent Common Stock, there shall be paid
to the record holder of such shares of Parent Common Stock, without interest,
(i) at the time of the distribution, the amount of cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock; and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the distribution of such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and a payment date subsequent to the
distribution of such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(e) _No Further Rights in SpinCo Common Stock_. All shares of Parent Common
Stock issued upon the exchange of SpinCo Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this _Article III_ (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section
3.01(c)_ or _Section 3.01(e)_) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid,
as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of SpinCo Common Stock.

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of SpinCo Common Stock, and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote, or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Parent. All fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that a holder of shares of SpinCo Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated by the
Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall cause the whole shares obtained
thereby to be sold on behalf of such holders of shares of SpinCo Common Stock
that would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, in the open market or otherwise, in each
case at then-prevailing market

 



21  prices, and in no case later than five (5) Business Days after the time of
the Distribution. The Exchange Agent shall make available the net proceeds
thereof, subject to the deduction of the amount of any withholding Taxes as
contemplated in _Section 3.01(i)_ and brokerage charges, commissions and
conveyance and similar Taxes, on a _pro rata_ __ basis, without interest, as
soon as practicable to the holders of SpinCo Common Stock that would
otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger.

(g)  _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or SpinCo Common Stock), extraordinary
cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or SpinCo Common Stock (other than, in the case of SpinCo Common
Stock, to the extent contemplated in the Separation Agreement) with a record
date occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time,
other than the issuance of stock by SpinCo in the Separation, the Special
Dividend, or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Separation Agreement; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 3.01(f)_ shall
be construed to permit SpinCo, Parent or Merger Sub to take any action with
respect to its securities that otherwise is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

(h) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to
the former holders of Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former
holders of Shares who have not theretofore received shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.04(a)_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(e) _and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to
which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ (subject to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law).

(i) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Citrix, SpinCo, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund (or dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock) or other cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, any
provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law or any other Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Persons otherwise entitled thereto in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 3.02 _Stock Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of SpinCo shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of SpinCo.

 

Section 3.03 _No Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Shares in
connection with the Merger.

Section 3.04 _Citrix Equity Awards_ _._

 

(a) Each Citrix Stock Option held by a SpinCo Employee that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, remain outstanding as an
option to acquire shares of Citrix Common Stock pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the applicable award.

 



22 (b) Each Citrix RSU held by a SpinCo Employee that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is subject to time-based vesting
shall, after taking into account any accelerated vesting in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the
applicable award, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, cease as of the Effective Time to represent the right
with respect to Citrix Common Stock and shall be cancelled and a substitute
Parent RSU with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock shall be granted on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Citrix RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including vesting and forfeiture provisions),
with the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent
RSU equal to the number of shares of Citrix Common Stock subject to each
Citrix RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Adjustment Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share.

 

(c) Each Citrix RSU held by a SpinCo Employee that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is subject to performance-based
vesting shall be adjusted based on an interim performance assessment as if the
applicable performance period ended as of the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date and pro-rated based on the portion of the 36-month
performance period which has elapsed as of the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date, rounded down to the nearest whole share (each an "Adjusted
Citrix RSU"). Each Adjusted Citrix RSU then shall, after taking into account
any accelerated vesting in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the applicable award, automatically
and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease as of
the Effective Time to represent the right with respect to Citrix Common Stock
and shall be cancelled and a substitute Parent RSU with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be granted on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to the Adjusted Citrix RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except that such awards shall thereafter be subject to cliff vesting as of
the end of the applicable performance period and no longer subject to any
performance-vesting criteria), with the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each such Parent RSU equal to the number of shares of Citrix
Common Stock subject to each Adjusted Citrix RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Adjustment Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Citrix RSU held by a
SpinCo Employee with respect to the 2014-2016 performance period that remains
outstanding as of the Effective Time shall not be adjusted, prorated or
cancelled and no Parent RSU shall be granted in substitution for such Citrix
RSU as provided in this _Section 3.04(c)_. Each Citrix RSU described in the
immediately preceding sentence shall continue to constitute the right to earn
shares of Citrix Common Stock based on the actual performance of Citrix
during such performance period in accordance with the terms of the applicable
award agreements (except that the Effective Time shall not constitute a
termination of employment of any SpinCo Employee for purposes of such Citrix
RSU).

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Citrix Board and/or the Compensation
Committee of the Citrix Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
Citrix shall take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions
of this _Section 3.04_.

 

Section 3.05 _Determination of Net Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Citrix shall
prepare and deliver to Parent a report setting forth an estimate, prepared in
good faith based on SpinCos and Citrixs books and records and other
information available at the time, of (i) the SpinCo Cash Amount (the
"Estimated Cash Amount"), (ii) the total amount of SpinCo Indebtedness as of
the Closing (the "Estimated SpinCo Indebtedness"), (iii) the SpinCo Working
Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital") and the calculation by Citrix of the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment (if any), (iv) the SpinCo Deferred
Revenue (the "Estimated SpinCo Deferred Revenue") and the calculation by
Citrix of the Estimated SpinCo Deferred Revenue Surplus (if any), and (v) the
calculation by Citrix of the Initial Net Adjustment Amount (if any), which,
in the case of Estimated Working Capital and Estimated SpinCo Deferred
Revenue, shall be prepared in a manner consistent in all respects with the
Sample Working Capital Statement, including the line items set forth therein
in accordance with GAAP (the report referred to in this sentence is
hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Statement") together with any
documentary materials used in the calculations thereof. If based on the
Closing Statement, the Initial Net Adjustment Amount is a positive number,
then immediately prior to the Closing, SpinCo shall distribute to Citrix an
amount in cash equal to such Initial Net Adjustment Amount, and if based on
the Closing Statement, the Initial Net Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, then immediately prior to the Closing, Citrix shall contribute to
SpinCo an amount in cash equal to the absolute value of such Initial Net
Adjustment Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Initial Net Adjustment
Amount is zero (0), then no payments shall be made in connection therewith.

 



23 (b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to Citrix a report that sets forth Parents good faith calculation of
(A) the SpinCo Cash Amount, (B) the total SpinCo Indebtedness as of the
Closing, (C) the SpinCo Working Capital, (D) the Final Working Capital
Adjustment (if any), (E) the SpinCo Deferred Revenue, (F) the Final SpinCo
Deferred Revenue Surplus (if any), and (G) the Final Net Adjustment Amount (if
any) which, in the case of SpinCo Working Capital and SpinCo Deferred Revenue,
shall be prepared in a manner consistent in all respects with the Sample
Working Capital Statement, including the line items set forth therein in
accordance with GAAP (the report referred to in this sentence is hereinafter
referred to as the "SpinCo Closing Report"). Citrix shall provide reasonable
assistance, including reasonably requested documentation, to Parent in the
preparation of the SpinCo Closing Report. Parent shall also deliver to Citrix
documentary materials and analyses used in preparation of the SpinCo Closing
Report reasonably requested by Citrix. The amounts set forth in the SpinCo
Closing Report shall be determined in accordance with GAAP and in accordance
with the definitions set forth in this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event that Citrix believes that (i) the SpinCo Closing Report
prepared by Parent does not accurately reflect all or any portion of the
SpinCo Cash Amount, SpinCo Working Capital, SpinCo Deferred Revenue or SpinCo
Indebtedness at Closing, (ii) the Final Working Capital Adjustment, the SpinCo
Deferred Revenue Surplus and/or the Final Net Adjustment Amount were
incorrectly calculated by Parent, and/or (iii) the SpinCo Closing Report was
not prepared in the manner required by this Agreement, Citrix shall, within
thirty (30) days of the date on which Parent delivers the SpinCo Closing
Report to Citrix, prepare and deliver to Parent a written notice of dispute
(the "Dispute Notice"), which Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for the dispute. In the event that Citrix does not deliver a
Dispute Notice to Parent within the time period required by the immediately
preceding sentence, then the SpinCo Closing Report prepared by Parent,
including the SpinCo Cash Amount, SpinCo Working Capital, SpinCo Deferred
Revenue, SpinCo Indebtedness, Final Working Capital Adjustment, Final SpinCo
Deferred Revenue Surplus and Final Net Adjustment Amount set forth therein,
shall be deemed to be and shall become final, binding and conclusive on all of
the parties hereto.

 

(d) In the event that Citrix timely delivers a Dispute Notice to Parent in
accordance with the terms hereof, Parent and Citrix shall attempt to
reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any such
disputes shall be final, binding and conclusive on all of the parties hereto.
If Citrix and Parent are unable to resolve any such dispute within ten (10)
Business Days of Parents receipt of the Dispute Notice from Citrix, Parent
and Citrix shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to KPMG
LLP (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). Promptly following the engagement of
the Independent Accounting Firm, and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days following such engagement, Parent and Citrix shall submit to such
Independent Accounting Firm (and the other party) all documentary materials
and analyses that Parent or Citrix, as the case may be, believes to be
relevant to a resolution of the dispute set forth in the Dispute Notice. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items or amounts set
forth in the SpinCo Closing Report as to which Citrix has disagreed in the
Dispute Notice. The Independent Accounting Firm shall, within thirty (30) days
after receipt of all such submissions by Parent and Citrix, determine and
deliver to Parent and Citrix a written report containing such
Independent Accounting Firms determination of all disputed matters submitted
to it for resolution, and such written report and the determinations contained
therein shall be final, binding and conclusive on all of the parties hereto.
The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
allocated to Citrix in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such
remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that
is unsuccessfully disputed by Citrix (as finally determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted, and the balance shall be paid by Parent.

 

(e) If the Final Net Adjustment Amount as finally determined in accordance
with this _Section 3.05_ is a negative number, then within two (2) Business
Days following the final determination of the Final Net Adjustment Amount,
Citrix shall pay to the Surviving Corporation via wire transfer in immediately
available funds (in accordance with the wire instructions provided by
the Surviving Corporation) an amount in cash equal to the absolute value of
such Final Net Adjustment Amount. If the Final Net Adjustment Amount as
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 3.05_ is a positive
number, then within two (2) Business Days following the final determination
of the Final Net Adjustment Amount, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to Citrix via wire transfer in immediately available funds
(in accordance with the wire instructions provided by Citrix) an amount in
cash equal to such Final Net Adjustment Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Final Net Adjustment Amount is zero (0), then no payments shall be made in
connection therewith.

provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the representations and
warranties contained in this _Section 4.11(e)_ are the only
representations and warranties being made by the Citrix Entities with respect

threatened, and no Citrix Entity has received from or delivered to any Person
written notice of a claim, for any such infringement, misappropriation or
other violation. 

(g) The Citrix Entities have taken reasonable security measures to protect the
confidentiality of Trade Secrets included in the SpinCo Intellectual
Property, including requiring each employee and consultant of a Citrix Entity
and any other Person with access to such Trade Secrets to execute a binding
confidentiality agreement, copies or forms of which have been made available
to Parent and, to the Knowledge of Citrix, there has not been any breach by
any party to such confidentiality agreements.

(h) All current or former employees, consultants and contractors of the
Citrix Entities who have contributed to the SpinCo Intellectual Property did

the development of any SpinCo Product with any Free or Open Source Software,
nor the incorporation, linking, calling, distribution or other use in, by or
with any SpinCo Product of any such Free or Open Source Software, (i)
obligates any Citrix Entity to disclose, make available, offer or deliver any
portion of the source code of such SpinCo Product or component thereof to any
third party, or (ii) requires that any SpinCo Product be licensed for the
purpose of making derivative works, or be licensed under terms that allow

conditions of any license for Free or Open Source Software that is contained
in, incorporated into, linked or called by, distributed with, or otherwise
used by any SpinCo Product.

providers possession or control from unauthorized access; and (ii) the Citrix
Entities hardware, software, encryption, systems, policies and procedures
are reasonably sufficient to protect the security and confidentiality of all
material SpinCo Customer Data. To the Knowledge of Citrix, none of the Citrix

security that has permitted or resulted in any unauthorized access to or
disclosure of SpinCo Customer Data. In the collection and processing by the
Citrix Entities of any SpinCo Customer Data, the Citrix Entities, and, to the
Knowledge of Citrix, their service providers have complied in all material
respects with applicable Information Privacy Laws and the Privacy Policies of
the Citrix Entities. No Action has been filed or commenced or, to the

or both) under any SpinCo IP Contract; (ii) cause the release, disclosure, or
delivery of any SpinCo Intellectual Property by or to any escrow agent or
other person, or any grant, assignment, or transfer to any other person of any

Section 5.04 _Governmental Consents and Approvals_. The execution, delivery
and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the execution,
delivery and performance by Parent of the Loan Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is contemplated to be a party do not require any

declaration or action, or to make such filing or notification, would not
prevent or materially delay the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Loan Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements or would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.05 _SEC Filings; Financial Information_.

 

(a) Parent has made available to Citrix complete and correct copies of the
Parent SEC Documents. Since January 1, 2013, Parent has filed with the SEC
each report, statement, schedule or registration statement or other filing
required by applicable Law to be filed by Parent at or prior to the time so
required. As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Parent SEC
Document complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), no Parent SEC Document filed
pursuant to the Exchange Act contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. No Parent SEC Document that is a registration statement,
as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment
became effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained (or incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC
Documents (i) present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial
position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
the results of operations and cash flows of Parent and its Subsidiaries for
the periods covered thereby (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal and recurring year-end adjustments which have not had, and would not
have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect); and (ii) were prepared in accordance
with GAAP as applied by Parent (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of
the SEC).

 



41 (c) Parent has timely filed all certifications and statements required by (i)
Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act; or (ii) 18 U.S.C. Section
1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) with respect to all
applicable Parent SEC Documents. Parent maintains disclosure controls and
procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act;
such controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material
information concerning Parent and its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely
basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Parents SEC
filings and other public disclosure documents. As used in this _Section
5.05(c)_ , the term "filed" shall be broadly construed to include any manner
in which a document or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made
available to the SEC. There were no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses identified in managements assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 (nor has
any such deficiency or weakness been identified as of the date hereof).

(d) Parent maintains, and has maintained, a standard system of accounting
established and administered in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis. Parent and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations;
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis and to
maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only
in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; and (iv)
the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets
at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.

(e) Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Separation Agreement, the Loan Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (i)
Parent will not be insolvent; (ii) Parent will not be left with unreasonably
small capital; (iii) Parent will not have incurred debts or other Liabilities
beyond its ability to pay such debts or other Liabilities as they mature; and
(iv) the capital of Parent will not be impaired.

 

Section 5.06 _Absence of Changes_. Since December 31, 2015, (a) there has not
occurred any Parent Material Adverse Effect and (b) except as contemplated by
or permitted under this Agreement, Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, since December 31, 2015, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that would require the
consent of Citrix under _clauses (vi)_ , _(viii)_ - _(ix)_ or _(xiv)_ -
_(xvi)_ of _Section 6.02(b)_ if taken after the date hereof.

 

Section 5.07 _Litigation_. There is no Action by or against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries pending or, to Parents Knowledge, threatened before any
Governmental Authority that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
would prevent or materially delay the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Loan Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

Section 5.08 _Registration Statement_. The information supplied by Parent for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements and
the Proxy Statement and, if applicable, the Schedule TO and any other filing
contemplated by _Section 7.01_, shall not, (a) with respect to each
Registration Statement, at the time each Registration Statement is declared
or becomes effective; (b) with respect to the Parent Registration Statement,
at the time the prospectus contained in such Registration Statement is first
mailed to stockholders of Citrix; (c) with respect to the Proxy Statement, at
the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto)
is first mailed to the stockholders of Parent; (d) at the time of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting; (e) at the time the Schedule TO is filed with the SEC
(if applicable); (f) on the Distribution Date; or (g) at the Effective Time,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fail to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. All documents that Parent is responsible for filing with
the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Loan Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements will comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

by a Governmental Authority of, or to Parents Knowledge has been
investigated by any Governmental Authority with respect to, any violation by
Parent or its Subsidiaries of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, or any similar
U.S. or foreign Law concerning corrupt payments applicable to its businesses.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to Parents Knowledge, any
Person authorized to act, and acting, on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries
has paid or given, offered or promised to pay or give, or authorized or
ratified the payment or giving, directly or indirectly, of any monies or
anything of value to any national, provincial, municipal or other government

or Governmental Authority for the direct or indirect purpose of influencing
any act or decision of such Person or of the Governmental Authority to obtain
or retain business, or direct business to any person or to secure any other
improper benefit or advantage that has resulted in a material violation of

applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (i) _ _ Citrix, SpinCo, Parent and Merger Sub shall jointly
prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, a proxy statement relating to the

Citrix, SpinCo, Parent and Merger Sub shall jointly prepare, and SpinCo shall
file with the SEC, a registration statement to register under the Securities

as an exchange offer, Citrix shall prepare and file with the SEC, when and as
required, a Schedule TO and other filings pursuant to Rule 13e-4 under the

promptly as practicable after such filing, and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of
Parent Common Stock as promptly as practicable following the date on which
(i) the Parent Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC; or

the date on which Parent files with the SEC a definitive proxy statement,
following confirmation from the staff of the SEC (whether orally or in
writing) that the comment process with respect to the Proxy Statement, if any,
has concluded, and, if required by the SEC as a condition to the mailing of
the Proxy Statement, the date on which the Parent Registration Statement is
declared effective. Each of Parent and Citrix shall also take any action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state securities
Laws in connection with, in the case of Parent, the Parent Share Issuance and,
in the case of Citrix, the issuance of the SpinCo Common Stock in the
Distribution and, if applicable, the exchange of SpinCo Common Stock pursuant
to an exchange offer. The parties hereto shall cooperate in preparing and
filing with the SEC the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statements, the
Schedule TO and any necessary amendments or supplements thereto. Parent and
Merger Sub shall furnish all information concerning Parent and the Parent
Entities, and Citrix and SpinCo shall furnish all information concerning
Citrix, the SpinCo Business and the Transferred Subsidiaries, as may be
reasonably requested by the other parties hereto in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, the Registration
Statements, the Schedule TO and any necessary amendments or supplements
thereto. None of the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statements, the
Schedule _ _ TO nor any amendment or supplement thereto shall be filed or
mailed to stockholders without the written consent of all of the parties
hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(b) The Proxy Statement shall (i) state that the Parent Board has approved
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, approved and declared
advisable the Parent Charter Amendment and approved the Parent Share Issuance;
and (ii) include the Parent Recommendation (except to the extent that
Parent effects a Change in the Parent Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 7.03(d)_). The Proxy Statement shall further state that approval of
the Parent Charter Amendment and the New Parent Stock Plan are not conditions
to the closing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Parent Share Issuance.

receiving oral or written notice of (i) the time when a Registration Statement
has become effective or any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or

Statement, a Registration Statement or the Schedule TO or SEC comments thereon
or requests by the SEC for additional information. Parent and Citrix shall
promptly provide each other with copies of any written communication from the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, the

 



56  Registration Statements or the Schedule TO and shall cooperate to prepare
appropriate responses thereto (and will provide each other with copies of any
such responses given to the SEC) and make such modifications to the Proxy
Statement, the Registration Statements and the Schedule TO as shall be
reasonably appropriate.

(d) If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance
shall be discovered by a party hereto that should be set forth in an amendment
or a supplement to a Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or the
Schedule TO so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or fail to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, such party shall promptly inform the other parties hereto and
the parties hereto shall cause an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information to be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to stockholders.

 

(e) In connection with the filing of the Registration Statements and other SEC
filings contemplated hereby, each of Citrix and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate with the other party to prepare pro
forma financial statements that comply with the rules and regulations of the
SEC to the extent required for such SEC filings, including the requirements
of Regulation S-X; and (ii) provide and make reasonably available upon
reasonable notice the senior management employees of the other party to
discuss the materials prepared and delivered pursuant to this _Section
7.01(e)_.

 

(f) To the extent required to be included in the Parent Registration
Statement, Citrix shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable after the end of any fiscal quarter, prepare and furnish to Parent
copies of combined financial statements of the SpinCo Business as of and for
the periods ending on any fiscal quarterly and annual periods ending after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (including the combined
financial statements for the corresponding period in the preceding year), in
each case together with the notes thereto, and prepared from the books and
records of Citrix and its Subsidiaries and in accordance with GAAP, with no
exception or qualification thereto, applied on a consistent basis through the
periods involved (except as may otherwise be required under GAAP) and the
rules and regulations of the SEC, including the requirements of Regulation
S-X. In the case of any such combined financial statements of the SpinCo
Business for any fiscal year, Citrix shall use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure that such financial statements shall be audited and accompanied by a
report of the independent auditors for the SpinCo Business. In the case of any
such combined financial statements of the SpinCo Business for any quarterly
period, Citrix shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
such financial statements shall be reviewed by the independent auditors for
the SpinCo Business. Citrix will use reasonable best efforts to procure, at
its expense, the delivery of the consents of its independent auditors required
to be filed with the Registration Statements.

Section 7.02 _Parent Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_. Parent shall take all lawful
action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the "Parent Stockholders Meeting") as promptly as practicable
following the date on which the SEC clears (whether orally or in writing) the
Proxy Statement and, if required by the SEC as a condition to the mailing of
the Proxy Statement, the Parent Registration Statement is declared effective,
for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval (and no other
matters, except for a proposal to adjourn the meeting to solicit additional
proxies to obtain the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, if necessary, and any
other proposal required by applicable Law, shall be considered or voted upon
at the Parent Stockholders Meeting without Citrixs prior written consent).
Parent agrees that the obligation of Parent to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by (a) the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to
Parent or its stockholders of any Competing Parent Transaction; or (b) any
Change in the Parent Recommendation. Subject to _Section 7.03(d)_ , Parent
shall solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Parent
Stockholder Approval and shall take all other action reasonably necessary or
advisable to secure the Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent agrees that it
shall not, prior to the termination of this Agreement, submit to a vote of
the stockholders of Parent any Competing Parent Transaction or Competing
Parent Transaction Agreement (in either case, whether or not a Superior
Proposal) prior to the vote of Parents stockholders to obtain the Parent
Stockholder Approval.

 

Section 7.03 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that
it shall cause each of its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) _ _ solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of

 



57  furnishing nonpublic information), or take any other action to knowingly
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including
any proposal or offer to Parents stockholders), with respect to any
Competing Parent Transaction; (ii) enter into, maintain, continue or otherwise
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person in
furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer with respect
to a Competing Parent Transaction; (iii) agree to, approve, endorse, recommend
or consummate any Competing Parent Transaction; (iv) enter into any Competing
Parent Transaction Agreement; (v) take any action to approve a third party
becoming an "interested stockholder", or to approve any transaction, for
purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL; or (vi) resolve, propose or agree, or
authorize any Representative, to do any of the foregoing. Parent acknowledges
and agrees that the doing of any of the foregoing by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach by Parent of
this _Section 7.03(a)_. Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than Citrix and its Affiliates) conducted
prior to the execution of this Agreement by Parent or any of
its Representatives with respect to any Competing Parent Transaction. Parent
shall not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, release any
third party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which it or one of its Affiliates is a party in connection with
a Competing Parent Transaction; _provided_ that Parent shall be permitted to
grant a waiver of any standstill agreement, in response to a _bona fide_
unsolicited request for such waiver from the counterparty thereto, to permit
a confidential proposal for a Competing Parent Transaction to be made to the
Parent Board if the Parent Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after
consulting with outside legal counsel), that the failure to take such action
would be a breach of the Parent Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
Parent shall promptly request each Person (other than Citrix and its
Affiliates) that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement with
Parent in connection with such Persons consideration of a Competing Parent
Transaction (whether by merger, acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise),
to return (or if permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement,
destroy) all information required to be returned (or, if applicable,
destroyed) by such Person under the terms of the applicable confidentiality
agreement.

 

(b) Parent shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
after Parent attains knowledge thereof) notify Citrix, orally and in writing,
after the receipt by Parent or any of its Representatives of any proposal,
inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment thereto) with respect to a
Competing Parent Transaction, including any request for discussions or
negotiations and any request for information relating to Parent or any of its
Affiliates in connection therewith or for access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect
thereto. Such notice shall indicate the identity of the Person making such
proposal, inquiry, offer or request and a description of such proposal,
inquiry, offer or request, including the material terms and conditions (if
any) of such proposed Competing Parent Transaction, and Parent shall promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt by Parent)
provide to Citrix copies of any written materials received by Parent in
connection with any of the foregoing. Parent agrees that it shall keep
Citrix reasonably informed of the status and material details of (including
discussions with respect to or amendments or proposed amendments to) (i) any
such proposal, inquiry, offer or request; and (ii) any information requested
of or provided by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.03(c)_. Parent shall provide
Citrix with at least forty-eight (48) hours prior notice of any meeting of the
Parent Board at which the Parent Board is reasonably expected to consider any
proposal, inquiry, offer or request with respect thereto (or any lesser
advance notice otherwise provided to members of the Parent Board in respect of
such meeting). Parent agrees that it shall substantially simultaneously
provide or make available to Citrix any nonpublic information concerning
Parent that may be made available pursuant to _Section 7.03(c)_ to any other
Person in response to any such proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any
amendment thereto) unless such information has previously been provided or
made available by Parent to Citrix.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.03_ , at any
time prior to the receipt of the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, Parent may
furnish information to, and enter into discussions and negotiations with, a
Person who has made an unsolicited written, _bona fide_ proposal or offer with
respect to a Competing Parent Transaction that did not arise or result from a
breach of this _Section 7.03_ if, prior to furnishing such information and
entering into such discussions, the Parent Board has (i) determined, in its
good faith judgment (after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that such proposal or offer
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal; and,
after consulting with outside legal counsel, that the failure to furnish such
information to, or enter into such discussions with, the Person who made such
proposal or offer would be a breach of the Parent Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; (ii) provided written notice to Citrix of its intent to
furnish information or enter into discussions with such Person prior to taking
the first of any such action with respect to any given Person; and (iii)
obtained from such Person an 

 



58  Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and any related agreements shall not include any
provision granting such Person exclusive rights to negotiate with Parent or
having the effect of prohibiting Parent from satisfying its obligations under
this Agreement) and, immediately upon its execution, delivered to Citrix a
copy of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. 

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 7.03(d)_ , neither the Parent Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify, amend or fail
to make, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend the Parent
Recommendation; (ii) make any public statement inconsistent with the Parent
Recommendation; or (iii) approve or adopt, or recommend the approval or
adoption of, or publicly propose to approve or adopt, any Competing Parent
Transaction (any of the actions described in (i), (ii) or (iii), a "Change in
the Parent Recommendation"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time
prior to the receipt of the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, in response to
the receipt of an offer or proposal with respect to a Competing Parent
Transaction that did not arise or result from a breach of this _Section 7.03_
 or in response to an Intervening Event, the Parent Board determines in its
good faith judgment (after consulting with outside legal counsel), that the
failure by the Parent Board to make a Change in the Parent Recommendation
would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and with
respect to an offer or proposal, after consulting with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such offer or
proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Parent Board may, with respect
to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, make a Change in the Parent
Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Board shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Change in the Parent Recommendation
pursuant to this _Section 7.03(d)_ unless:

(i) Parent has provided written notice to Citrix advising Citrix that the
Parent Board has received a Superior Proposal or that an Intervening Event has
occurred promptly after the Parent Board determines to make a Change in the
Parent Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or Intervening
Event, stating that the Parent Board intends to make a Change in the Parent
Recommendation and describing the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal or the material facts and circumstances of such
Intervening Event; and

(ii) Citrix does not, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such notice
required by _Section 7.03(d)(i)_ (the "Notice Period"), make a written offer
or proposal to revise the terms of this Agreement (any such offer, a "Revised
Transaction Proposal") in a manner that the Parent Board determines in
its good faith judgment, after consulting with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, to be at least as
favorable to Parents stockholders as such Superior Proposal or, in the case
of an Intervening Event, after consulting with outside legal counsel, permits
the Board (consistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law) to not
make a Change in the Parent Board Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, during the Notice Period, Parent shall negotiate in good faith with
Citrix (to the extent Citrix desires to negotiate) regarding any Revised
Transaction Proposal; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any amendment to the
terms of such Superior Proposal or any material change to the facts and
circumstances of the Intervening Event during the Notice Period shall require
a new written notice from Parent describing such amendment or material change
and an additional three (3) Business Day Notice Period that satisfies this
_Section 7.03(d)(ii)_ , including with respect to Parents obligations to
negotiate in good faith with Citrix.

 

(e) Any disclosure that the Parent Board may be required to make under
applicable Law (including to the extent the Parent Board determines in its
good faith judgment, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make such disclosure would be a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law) with respect to the receipt of a proposal or offer with
respect to a Competing Parent Transaction or under Item 1012(a) of Regulation
M-A or Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act will not
constitute a violation of this _Section 7.03_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) make a
Change in the Parent Recommendation in connection with such disclosure unless
permitted by _Section 7.03(d)_ and (ii) any public statement made that
relates to a Competing Parent Transaction shall be deemed to be a Change in
the Parent Recommendation unless the Parent Board references or otherwise
reaffirms the Parent Recommendation in such public statement (it being
understood that any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of
Parent pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Change in the
Parent Recommendation). Any Change in the Parent Recommendation shall
not change the approval of the Parent Board for purposes of causing any state
takeover statute or other state Law to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



59 (f) Citrix agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that
it shall cause each of its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
nonpublic information), or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including any proposal or
offer to Parents stockholders), with respect to any Competing SpinCo
Transaction; (ii) enter into, maintain, continue or otherwise engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person in furtherance
of such inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer with respect to a Competing
SpinCo Transaction; (iii) agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or consummate
any Competing SpinCo Transaction; (iv) enter into any Competing SpinCo
Transaction Agreement; or (v) resolve, propose or agree, or authorize any
Representative to do any of the foregoing. Citrix acknowledges and agrees that
the doing of any of the foregoing by Citrix or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach by Citrix of this _Section
7.03(f)_. Citrix shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations
with any Persons (other than Parent and its Affiliates) conducted prior to the
execution of this Agreement by Citrix or any of its Representatives with
respect to any Competing SpinCo Transaction. Citrix shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Representatives to, release any third party from, or
waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which
it or one of its Affiliates is a party in connection with any Competing
SpinCo Transaction. Citrix shall promptly request each Person (other than
Parent and its Affiliates) that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement with Citrix in connection with such Persons consideration of any
Competing SpinCo Transaction (whether by merger, acquisition of stock or
assets or otherwise), to return (or if permitted by the applicable
confidentiality agreement, destroy) all information required to be returned
(or, if applicable, destroyed) by such Person under the terms of the
applicable confidentiality agreement. Citrix shall promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours after Citrix attains knowledge thereof) notify
Parent, orally and in writing, after the receipt by Citrix or any of its
Representatives of any proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment
thereto) with respect to a Competing SpinCo Transaction, including any request
for discussions or negotiations and any request for information relating to
Citrix or any of its Affiliates with respect to the SpinCo Business, or for
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Citrix or any
of its Affiliates with respect to the SpinCo Business.

 

Section 7.04 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, upon reasonable notice,
Citrix shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) afford Parent and its
authorized Representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties and
books and records of the SpinCo Business; and (ii) furnish to the authorized
Representatives of Parent such additional available information regarding the
SpinCo Business (or copies thereof), as Parent may from time to time
reasonably request; _provided_ that (x) any such access or furnishing of
information shall be conducted at Parents expense, during normal business
hours, under the supervision of Citrixs personnel and in such a manner as
not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the SpinCo
Business; (y) all requests for access pursuant to this _Section 7.04(a)_
shall be made in writing and shall be directed to and coordinated with a
person or persons designated by Citrix in writing; and (z) Parent shall not,
and shall cause its Representatives not to, contact any of the employees,
customers, distributors or suppliers of any Citrix Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Loan Agreement, the
Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, whether in person or by
telephone, mail, or other means of communication, without the prior written
authorization of Citrix (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Citrix
shall not be required to provide any access or disclose any information
to Parent or its Representatives if such disclosure would reasonably be
expected to (A) jeopardize, or result in a loss or waiver of, any attorney-
client or other legal privilege; (B) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary
duty or agreement; or (C) result in the loss of protection of any proprietary
information or Trade Secrets of any Citrix Entity. When accessing any of
Citrixs properties, Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
comply with all of Citrixs security requirements for the applicable
property; _provided_ that Citrix shall give notice to Parent of the fact that
it is withholding such access or information pursuant to _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_
or _(C)_ of this _Section 7.04(a)_ and thereafter Citrix and Parent shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause such access or
information, as applicable, to be provided, or made available, in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to jeopardize such privilege,
contravene such applicable Law, fiduciary duty or agreement, or result in any
loss of such protection of proprietary information. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall Citrix be required to
provide any information relating to any Excluded Assets or Excluded
Liabilities.

 



60 (b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, upon reasonable notice,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) afford Citrix and its
authorized Representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties and
books and records of the businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries; and (ii)
furnish to the authorized Representatives of Citrix such additional available
information regarding the businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries (or copies
thereof), as Citrix may from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ that
(x) any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at
Citrixs expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision of the
personnel of Parent or its Subsidiaries and in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the businesses of Parent
and its Subsidiaries; (y) all requests for access pursuant to this _Section
7.04(b)_ shall be made in writing and shall be directed to and coordinated
with a person or persons designated by Parent in writing; and (z) Citrix
shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, contact any of the
employees, customers, distributors or suppliers of any Parent Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, whether in person or
by telephone, mail, or other means of communication, without the prior written
authorization of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
shall not be required to provide any access or disclose any information to
Citrix or its Representatives if such disclosure would reasonably be expected
to (A) jeopardize, or result in a loss or waiver of, any attorney-client or
other legal privilege; (B) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or
agreement; or (C) result in the loss of protection of any proprietary
information or Trade Secrets of any Parent Entity;  _provided_ that the
Parent shall give notice to Citrix of the fact that it is withholding such
access or information pursuant to _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ or _(C)_ of this
_Section 7.04(b)_ and thereafter Citrix and Parent shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such access or information, as
applicable, to be provided, or made available, in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to jeopardize such privilege, contravene such
applicable Law, fiduciary duty or agreement, or result in any loss of such
protection of proprietary information. When accessing any of the properties of
Parent or its Affiliates, Citrix shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, comply with all of Parents or its Affiliates security requirements for
the applicable property.

Section 7.05 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

(a) Parent shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries (i) to maintain for a
period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time provisions in
their respective certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar
organizational documents) concerning the indemnification and exculpation
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the Transferred
Subsidiaries respective former and current officers and directors that are no
less favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Transferred Subsidiaries, as applicable,
in each case, as of the date hereof and (ii) not to amend, repeal or
otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely affect
the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as required by
Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 7.05_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each present
and former director and officer of any Transferred Subsidiary and his or her
heirs and representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.05_.

 

Section 7.06 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities
that may be or become necessary or advisable for its execution and delivery
of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement, the
Loan Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary

 



61  Agreements; (ii) cooperate fully with the other parties in promptly seeking
to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals; and (iii)
provide such other information to any Governmental Authority as such
Governmental Authority may reasonably request in connection herewith. The
applicable party hereto (or its Affiliate) making any notice or filing with
any Governmental Authority as required by this _Section 7.06_ shall pay all
applicable filing or notice fees required in connection therewith; _provided_
that Parent or Citrix, as applicable, shall reimburse the other for its
portion of all antitrust filing fees such that Parent and Citrix shall bear
the cost of such fees evenly.

(b) Each party hereto agrees to, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to,
make promptly, and no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof
unless mutually agreed otherwise by the parties, its respective filing, if
necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. Each party further agrees that it will supply as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to
the HSR Act. Each party hereto agrees to, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates to, make as promptly as practicable its respective filings and
notifications, if any, under any other applicable antitrust, competition or
trade regulation Law and to supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the applicable
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the parties undertakings pursuant to
_Section 7.06(a)-(b)_, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by
any antitrust or competition Governmental Authority or any other party so as
to enable the parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated hereby and
by the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as promptly
as practicable, and in any event prior to the Termination Date, including
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of its
assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses
to be acquired by it pursuant hereto, and the entrance into such other
arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order to avoid the entry of,
and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of materially
delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
("Antitrust Remedial Actions"); _provided_ that the effectiveness of such
Antitrust Remedial Action shall be contingent on the consummation of
the Merger; and _provided_ _further_ that (i) no Antitrust Remedial Actions
that require sales, divestitures or dispositions of any assets, properties or
businesses shall be required if such assets, properties or businesses account
for more than $40.0 million in estimated, or, if applicable, actual revenues
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and (ii) no other Antitrust
Remedial Actions shall be required if such Antitrust Remedial Actions would
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
reduction in annual revenue to Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation and the Transferred Subsidiaries) of more than $40.0
million. In addition, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, defend
through litigation on the merits through a lower court ruling any Action by
any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would prevent the Closing prior to the Termination Date. Citrix acknowledges
that, subject to the provisions of _Section 7.06(d)_ , Parent shall control
any such Action with counsel of its choosing; _provided_ that Citrix shall be
allowed to participate in such defense, at its own expense, including to
engage counsel of its choosing, and Parent and Citrix agree to cooperate and
coordinate fully with each other and use their respective reasonable best
efforts in connection therewith, and in furtherance thereof, Parent agrees to
keep Citrix reasonably and timely informed of any developments with regard to
such Action. Cooperation and coordination shall include prior, good faith
consultation with Citrix as to any substantive aspects of litigation strategy
and consideration in good faith of Citrixs views and comments. In furtherance
of Parents obligations under this _Section 7.06(c)_, Citrix shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, enter into agreements or arrangements
reasonably requested by Parent to be entered into by any of them prior to the
Closing with respect to any matters contemplated by this _Section 7.06(c)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) this _Section 7.06(c)_ shall not require
Citrix or any of its Affiliates to agree to any sale, divestiture, disposition
or other arrangement with respect to any businesses or assets other than the
SpinCo Business and (ii) the effectiveness of any sale, divestiture or
disposition or entry into such other arrangements shall be contingent on the
consummation of the Merger.

 



62 (d) Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of any
communication it or any of its Representatives receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and
permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority. None of the parties hereto shall
agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect
of any filings, investigation (including any settlement of an investigation),
litigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other parties the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Each
party hereto shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other parties hereto may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act. Each party hereto
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, provide each other with copies
of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that materials may be redacted (i) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements or applicable Law; and (ii) as necessary
to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

 

(e) Each party hereto agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
not to, enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect any
transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that might reasonably be
expected to make it more difficult, or to increase the time required, by more
than a _de minimis_ extent, to (i) obtain the expiration or termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act, or any other applicable antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Law, applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Loan Agreement, the Separation Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements; (ii) avoid the entry of, the commencement of
litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that would materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
by the Loan Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;
or (iii) obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of
Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain the FCC Consent and (ii) obtain
all approvals, authorizations, or consents and submit all notices listed on
_Schedule 4.05_ of the Citrix Disclosure Letter.

 

Section 7.07 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3 and the
parties hereto hereby adopt it as such. From and after the date of this
Agreement and until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure the Tax-Free Status of the External
Transactions, including causing each of the Separation and the Merger to
qualify, and will not knowingly take any action, cause or permit any action to
be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken,
which action or failure to act could prevent the Tax-Free Status of the
External Transactions, including preventing the Separation or the Merger from
qualifying, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Following the Effective Time, none of Citrix, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent nor any of their Affiliates shall knowingly take any
action, cause or permit any action to be taken, fail to take any action or
cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or failure to act could
cause either the Separation or the Merger to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or otherwise
prevent the parties from achieving the Tax-Free Status of the External
Transactions.

(b) Parent and Citrix shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts in order for (i) Parent to obtain the opinion of Latham and Watkins LLP
("Parent Tax Counsel"), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
dated as of the Closing Date to the effect that, on the basis of the facts
and customary representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in
such opinion and the Tax Representation Letters and on the assumption that the
conclusion in _clause (ii)(A)_ of this _Section 7.07(b)_ is correct, for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of Parent,
Merger Sub and SpinCo will be a party to the reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code ("Parent Merger Tax Opinion"); (ii)
Citrix to obtain the opinion of Skadden, Arps,

 



63  Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP ("Citrix Tax Counsel"), in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Citrix, dated as of the Closing Date, on the basis of
the facts and customary representations and assumptions set forth or referred
to in such opinion and the Tax Representation Letters, as to the Tax-Free
Status of the External Transactions, including that for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes, (A) (1) the Contribution and Distribution, taken together, will
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and each of Citrix and SpinCo will be a party to the reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, (2) the Distribution, as such, will
qualify as a distribution of the SpinCo Common Stock to Citrixs shareholders
pursuant to Section 355 of the Code, and as a transaction in which the stock
distributed thereby is "qualified property" for purposes of Sections 355(d),
355(e) and 361(c) of the Code, and (3) the Merger will not cause Section
355(e) of the Code to apply to the Distribution (the "Citrix Separation
Tax Opinion"); and (B) the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that each of Parent, Merger Sub
and SpinCo will be a party to the reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(b) _ _ of the Code (the "Citrix Merger Tax Opinion," and
together with the Citrix Separation Tax Opinion, "Citrix RMT Tax Opinions"),
and (iii) any Tax opinions required to be filed with the SEC in connection
with the filing of the Registration Statement to be timely filed.

(c) As a condition precedent to the rendering of the Parent Merger Tax
Opinion and the Citrix RMT Tax Opinions, Parent, Citrix and SpinCo, and
others, if required, shall execute and deliver to Citrix Tax Counsel and
Parent Tax Counsel the Tax Representation Letters as of (i) the Closing Date
and (ii) the date for filing any Tax opinion required to be filed with the
SEC in connection with the filing of either of the Registration Statements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the foregoing does not require that any
Person make a representation that they do not believe to be accurate and (y)
each of Citrix and Parent, respectively, shall be entitled to a reasonable
amount of time to provide the other Party with written comments to the Tax
Representation Letters in support of the Citrix Merger Tax Opinion and the
Parent Merger Tax Opinion, respectively.

(d) As of the date hereof, Parent does not know of any reason (i) why it
would not be able to deliver the Tax Representation Letters at the applicable
times set forth in _Section 7.07(c)_ ; or (ii) why Parent would not be able
to obtain the opinion contemplated by _Section 8.02(b)(i)_. As of the date
hereof, Citrix and SpinCo do not know of any reason (i) why they would not be
able to deliver the Tax Representation Letters at the applicable times set
forth in _Section 7.07(c)_ ; or (ii) why Citrix would not be able to obtain
the opinion contemplated by _Section 8.03(b)(i)_.

(e) Citrix (i) as of the date of this Agreement, does not know and has no
reason to believe, that any SpinCo Common Stock to be exchanged for Parent
Common Stock may not be Qualified SpinCo Common Stock; (ii) will use its
reasonable best efforts to prevent any SpinCo Common Stock to be exchanged for
Parent Common Stock from not being Qualified SpinCo Common Stock; and (iii)
will promptly notify Parent if, before the Effective Time, it knows or has
reason to believe that any SpinCo Common Stock to be exchanged for Parent
Common Stock may not be Qualified SpinCo Common Stock.

(f) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall not
govern Tax matters (including any administrative, procedural and related
matters thereto), which shall be exclusively governed by the Tax Matters
Agreement and the Employee Matters Agreement.

 

Section 7.08 _Control of Other Party_ __ _s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Citrix or SpinCo, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct any of the operations of Parent prior to the Closing.

or indirectly, the right to control or direct any of the operations of
Citrix, the Transferred Subsidiaries or the SpinCo Business prior to the
Closing. Prior to the Closing, each of Citrix, SpinCo, Parent and Merger Sub
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its respective operations.

Section 7.09 _Listing of Shares of Parent Common Stock_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to
official notice of issuance, and Citrix shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent with respect to such listing.

Section 7.10 _Section_ _ _ _16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto shall take all steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of SpinCo Common Stock or acquisitions of Parent Common

 



64  Stock resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
officer or director who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to SpinCo or Parent, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.11  _Confidentiality_.

(a) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of November 2015 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), between Citrix and Parent, are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing and shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and
effect until their expiration in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, upon the Closing,
the confidentiality obligations of Parent contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate in respect of that portion of the Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively relating
to the SpinCo Business. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior
to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

(b) Nothing provided to Parent or Citrix or their respective Representatives
pursuant to _Section 7.04_ shall in any way amend or diminish the parties
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. Each of Parent and Citrix
acknowledges and agrees that any Confidential Information made available to
such party or its Representatives pursuant to _Section 7.04_ or otherwise by
the other party or any of its Representatives shall be subject to the terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 7.12 _Further Actions_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all

with the other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law (other than with respect to the matters
covered in _Section 7.06_ ) to execute and deliver the Loan Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and such other documents and other papers as may be
required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance
of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, Citrix and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into definitive agreements setting
forth the terms and conditions of the Commercial Arrangements, such terms and
conditions to be on an arms length basis and mutually agreeable to the
parties. Prior to the Closing, (i) neither Citrix nor SpinCo shall terminate
or assign the Separation Agreement, amend any provision of the Separation
Agreement or any Exhibit or Schedule thereto or waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained in the Separation Agreement, in each
case without the prior written consent of Parent; and (ii) any consent,
approval, authorization or similar action to be taken by SpinCo under the
Separation Agreement shall be subject to the prior written consent of Parent

(a) Citrix agrees that, from and after the date hereof until the date that is
two (2) years after the Closing Date, or, in the case of clause (y) below,

Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of Parent, directly or
indirectly, (x) solicit for employment any of the SpinCo Employees or (y) hire
any of the SpinCo Employees listed on _Schedule 7.13(a)_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the placement of any general mass solicitation or

violation of this  _Section 7.13(a)_; and (ii) this _Section 7.13(a)_ shall
not preclude

 



65  Citrix or its Subsidiaries from soliciting or hiring any SpinCo Employee
whose employment with a Parent Entity (including a Transferred Subsidiary) has
been terminated by such Parent Entity; and  _provided_ _further_ that nothing
in this _Section 7.13(a)_ shall require Citrix or any of its Subsidiaries to

would violate applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section
7.13(a)_ shall not restrict activities between Citrix and the SpinCo Employees
prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) Parent agrees that, from and after the date hereof until the date that is
one (1) year after the Closing Date, or, in the case of  _clauses (y)_ and

from soliciting or hiring any Citrix employee whose employment with a Citrix
Entity has been terminated by such Citrix Entity; and _provided_ _further_

date that is three (3) years after the Closing Date, it shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of Parent,

the world. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit
Citrix or any Citrix Entity from (i) (x) engaging in the businesses conducted
by the Citrix Entities (excluding the SpinCo Business) as of the date hereof
including, for the avoidance of doubt, all Citrix products and services
branded in whole or in part as XenApp, XenDesktop, XenServer, XenMobile,

the total consolidated revenues of such Person from the Competitive Business
for the fiscal year ended immediately prior to such acquisition do not exceed
15% of the total consolidated revenues of such Person for such fiscal year,
and (y) if such revenues exceed 10% of the total consolidated revenues of
such Person for such fiscal year, the Citrix Entities enter into a definitive
agreement to divest such Competitive Business so acquired not later than one
hundred twenty (120) days after the closing of such acquisition.

 

Section 7.14 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, for at least one (1) year following the Effective
Time, it shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, except as
otherwise required under the Employee Matters Agreement, provide each SpinCo
Employee, while such SpinCo Employee remains employed (a "Continuing SpinCo
Employee"), with the opportunity to participate in the employee
benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries in
substantially the same manner as similarly-situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
service of each Continuing SpinCo Employee to be recognized for purposes of
eligibility to participate, levels of benefits (but not for benefit accruals
under any defined benefit pension plan) and vesting under (i) any severance
policy or program of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates and (ii) for at least one (1) year after the Effective Time, each
other compensation, retirement,

 



66  vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, but not
including any equity compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements
in which any such employee is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely
to the extent service was credited to such employee for such purposes under a
comparable employee benefit plan, program or policy of Citrix and its
Subsidiaries (each a "Citrix Plan") immediately prior to the Effective Time
and solely to the extent such credit would not result in a duplication of
benefits.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, with respect to each Parent Plan that
provides for dental, medical or vision benefits in which any Continuing
SpinCo Employee participates, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each such Parent Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable under such
Parent Plan for such employees and their eligible dependents to the same
extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical
examinations and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived
under the corresponding Citrix Plan in which such employee was a participant
immediately prior to the Effective Time but, with respect to long-term
disability and life insurance benefits and coverage, solely to the extent
permitted under the terms and conditions of Parents applicable insurance
contracts in effect as of the relevant time; _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage includes eligibility
conditions based on periods of employment, _Section 7.14(a)_ shall control;
and (ii) provide each Continuing SpinCo Employee and his or her eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in the
calendar year that, and prior to the date that, such employee commences
participation in such Parent Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment or
deductible requirements under such Parent Plan for the applicable calendar
year, to the extent that such expenses were recognized for such purposes
under the comparable Citrix Plan. Citrix shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable provide Parent or its designee with such information as Parent
reasonably requests regarding the Citrix Plans and the participation of
Continuing SpinCo Employee therein and shall otherwise provide reasonable
cooperation and assistance to Parent at Citrixs expense to the extent
reasonably necessary to allow Parent to satisfy its obligations under
_Sections 7.14(a)_ and _(b)_.

(c) From time to time, upon Parents reasonable request, prior to the
Distribution Effective Time, Citrix shall provide Parent with (i) an updated
SpinCo Employee Schedule to reflect changes to the information provided on the
SpinCo Employee Schedule, including as result of new hires or employment
terminations and (ii) an updated SpinCo Contractor Schedule. Upon Parents
written notice to Citrix delivered at least five days prior to the
Distribution Effective Time, Citrix shall cause the employment of any
individuals mutually identified by Citrix and Parent to be transferred to
Citrix or one of its Subsidiaries (other than SpinCo and its Subsidiaries)
effective prior to the Distribution Effective Time and any such transferred
employee shall not be a SpinCo Employee for purposes of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement.

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_Section 7.14_ are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties to
this Agreement and shall not create any right in any other Person, or any
right to continued employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 7.14_  shall be deemed to amend or
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to
continue or amend any particular benefit plan before or after the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any such plan may be
amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

Section 7.15 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "business combination" or other form of antitakeover Law
shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors shall use all reasonable
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.16 _Defense of Litigation_. Parent shall keep Citrix apprised in the
defense of any Action brought by stockholders of Parent or in the name of
Parent against Parent and/or its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; _provided_ that, prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall not compromise, settle, come to
an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding any Action arising or resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or

 



67  consent to the same, without the prior written consent of Citrix (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the extent (a) such Action
includes Citrix or any of its Subsidiaries, or their directors or officers as
named defendants or (b) such compromise, settlement or arrangement would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
parties to perform their respective obligations hereunder, or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby in a timely manner.

Section 7.17 _SpinCo Authorized Shares_. __Prior to the Distribution, Citrix
and SpinCo shall take all such actions necessary to amend and restate SpinCo
s certificate of incorporation, in form reasonably acceptable to Parent, such
that the authorized number of shares of SpinCo Common Stock shall exceed the
number of Shares contemplated by _Section 2.04(f)_ of this Agreement.

TERMINATION

Section 9.01  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior
to the Effective Time, as follows:

 

(a) by either Parent or Citrix, if the Closing shall not have occurred by the
date that is twelve (12) months after the date hereof (the "Initial
Termination Date"); _provided_ that if the conditions set forth in _Sections
8.01(e)_ , _8.01(f)_ and _8.01(g)_ shall not have been satisfied or waived by
the Termination Date, but all other conditions to Closing (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied, then either Parent or Citrix may extend the Termination Date to the
close of business on the date that is fifteen (15) months after the date
hereof (the "Extended Termination Date" and, together with the Initial
Termination Date, as applicable, the "Termination Date") by giving written
notice of such extension to the other party; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.01(a)_ shall not
be available to any party hereto whose action or failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement or the Separation Agreement shall have been
the primary cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such
date;

(b) by either Parent or Citrix, in the event that any Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a Governmental Order that
permanently enjoins the consummation of the Merger and such Governmental Order
shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.01(b)_ shall not
be available to any party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement has been the primary cause of the issuance of such
Governmental Order or other action;

(c) by either Parent or Citrix, if at the Parent Stockholders Meeting
(including any adjournment, continuation or postponement thereof) the
Required Parent Stockholder Vote shall not have been obtained;

(d) by Citrix, if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement (including an
obligation to consummate the Closing) shall have occurred that would, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, cause the conditions set forth
in _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.03(a)_ not to be satisfied, and such breach is
not cured, or is incapable of being cured, prior to the Termination Date;
_provided_ that Citrix shall have given at least thirty (30) days (or such
lesser time remaining prior to the Termination Date) prior written notice to
Parent of such breach; _provided_ , _further_ , that Citrix is not then in
breach of this Agreement or the Separation Agreement so as to cause any of
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_ not to be
satisfied;

(e) by Citrix, if (i) a Change in the Parent Recommendation has occurred;
(ii) Parent shall have failed to include the Parent Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement; (iii) Parent shall have failed to convene the Parent
Stockholders Meeting at least sixty (60) days prior to the Termination Date;
or (iv) Parent shall have failed to comply in all material respects with its
obligations in _Section 7.03_ (it being understood, for the avoidance of
doubt, that any failure to comply with such covenants that results in a
Competing Parent Transaction shall be deemed material); _provided_ that, in
the event of a Change in the Parent Recommendation with respect to a Competing
Parent Transaction under clause (i) of this _Section 9.01(e)_ , Citrix shall
provide written notice to Parent of its decision to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)(i)_ within thirty (30) calendar days after Citrix
has been notified by Parent in writing of such Change in the
Parent Recommendation, and if Citrix does not provide such notice within such
thirty (30) calendar day period, Citrix shall be deemed to have waived the
termination right under _Section 9.01(e)(i)_ solely with respect to such
Change in the Parent Recommendation (it being understood that Citrix shall
retain the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any other applicable
provision of this Section 9.01 and to receive any payments related thereto
under _Section 9.03_ of this Agreement);

 



70 (f) by Parent, if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of Citrix or SpinCo set forth in this Agreement or the
Separation Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the Internal
Reorganization, the Separation or the Closing) shall have occurred that would,
if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, cause the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02(a)_ not to be satisfied, and such
breach is not cured, or is incapable of being cured, prior to the Termination
Date; _provided_ that Parent shall have given at least thirty (30) days (or
such lesser time remaining prior to the Termination Date) written notice to
Citrix of such breach; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent is not then in
breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.03_ not to be satisfied; or

(g) by the written consent of the parties hereto.

Section 9.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ , written notice thereof shall be
given to the other parties hereto, specifying the provision or provisions
hereof pursuant to which such termination shall have been made, and this
Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability under
this Agreement on the part of any party hereto or their respective
Representatives; _provided_ that no such termination shall relieve any party
from liability for fraud committed prior to such termination or for any
willful and material breach prior to such termination of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that _Section 7.11_ , this _Section 9.02_
, _Section 9.03_ and  _Article X_ shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and remain in full force and effect.

Section 9.03 _Fees and Expenses_.

prior to the termination of this Agreement, a Competing Parent Transaction
shall have been publicly announced and not publicly withdrawn or otherwise
communicated to the Parent Board or management and not withdrawn; and (C) on
or prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, Parent enters into a Competing Parent Transaction Agreement or
consummates a Competing Parent Transaction (whether or not the
applicable Competing Parent Transaction is the same as the original Competing
Parent Transaction publicly announced or communicated), then (x) on the
earlier of the date Parent enters into a Competing Parent Transaction
Agreement with respect to, or consummates, a Competing Parent Transaction
with any Person (or Affiliate thereof) involved in a Competing Parent
Transaction publicly announced or communicated prior to the termination of
this Agreement or (y) on the date Parent consummates any other Competing
Parent Transaction, Parent shall pay to Citrix the Termination Fee in cash in
immediately available funds, less the amount of any Expenses reimbursed by
Parent pursuant to _Section 9.03(b)_ ; _provided_ that, solely for purposes
of this _Section 9.03(a)(ii)_ , the references to "15%" in the definition of
Competing Parent Transaction shall be deemed to refer to "50%."

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that, if this Agreement shall be terminated
pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)_ , then Parent shall reimburse Citrix and SpinCo
for all of their Expenses in cash in immediately available funds, up to a

incurring such Expenses, whether or not the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement is consummated.

 



71 (d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event that Parent shall fail to pay the Termination Fee, or
Parent shall fail to pay any Expenses, when due, the amount of such payments
shall be increased to include the out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
or accrued by or on behalf of Citrix and SpinCo (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement
of this _Section 9.03_ , together with interest on such unpaid Termination
Fee or Expenses, commencing on the date that the Termination Fee or such
Expenses became due, at a rate of interest equal to the "prime rate" as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition, in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment
(calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed). Payment of the fees and expenses described in this _Section
9.03_  shall not be in lieu of any damages incurred in the event of fraud or
willful and material breach of this Agreement.

enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this

as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Letters, the

size of Borrower and its subsidiaries since the initial closing of the JPM
Credit Agreement and to make other modifications agreed to by Borrower and

stockholders shall be held each year on a date and a time designated by the
Board of Directors. At each annual meeting directors shall be elected and any
other proper business may be transacted.

 

Section 2.3 _Quorum; Adjourned Meetings and Notice Thereof_. A majority of the
stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders, the holders of which are present in person or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business except as
otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by
these Bylaws. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the
withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum and the votes present
may continue to transact business until adjournment. If, however, such quorum
shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, a
majority of the voting stock represented in person or by proxy may adjourn the
meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
notified. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote thereat.

 

Section 2.4 _Voting_. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the
holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or
represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting,
unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes, or
the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, a different vote is
required in which case such express provision shall govern and control the
decision of such question.

Section 2.5  _Proxies_. At each meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder
having the right to vote may vote in person or may authorize another person or
persons to act for him by proxy appointed by an instrument in writing
subscribed by such stockholder and bearing  a date not more than three years prior to said meeting, unless said
instrument provides for a longer period. All proxies must be filed with the
Secretary of the corporation at the beginning of each meeting in order to be
counted in any vote at the meeting. Each stockholder shall have one vote for
each share of stock having voting power, registered in his name on the books
of the corporation on the record date set by the Board of Directors as
provided in Article V, Section 5.6 hereof. All elections shall be had and all
questions decided by a plurality vote.

 

Section 2.6 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any
purpose, or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, may be called by the President and shall be
called by the President or the Secretary at the request in writing of a
majority of the Board of Directors, or at the request in writing of
stockholders owning a majority in amount of the entire capital stock of the
corporation issued and outstanding, and entitled to vote. Such request shall
state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Business transacted at
any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated
in the notice.

Section 2.7 _Notice of Stockholder_ __ _s Meetings_. Whenever stockholders
are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of
the meeting shall be given which notice shall state the place, date and hour
of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called. The written notice of any meeting
shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less
than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting. If mailed,
notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the
corporation.

 

Section 2.8 _Maintenance and Inspection of Stockholder List_. The officer who
has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at
least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of
shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to
the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,
during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the
meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held,
which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so
specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also
be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole
time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

Section 2.9  _Stockholder Action by Written Consent Without a Meeting_.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action
required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action
so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to
those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

 



2 ARTICLE III.

 

 _DIRECTORS_

Section 3.1 _Number, Election and Tenure_. The number of directors of the
corporation shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board.
Directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders and each
director shall serve until such persons successor is elected and qualified
or until such persons death, retirement, resignation or removal.

 

Section 3.2 _Vacancies_. Vacancies on the Board of Directors by reason of
death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or
otherwise, and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors
then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
The directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election of
directors and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify,
unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an
election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. If, at
the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the
directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole
Board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (the " _Court of Chancery_ ") may, upon
application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent of
the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to
vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any
such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors
chosen by the directors then in office.

 

Section 3.3 _Powers_. The property and business of the corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. In addition to
the powers and authorities by these Bylaws expressly conferred upon them, the
Board may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful
acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation
or by these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the
stockholders.

Section 3.4  _Directors_ __ _Meetings_. The directors may hold their
meetings and have one or more offices, and keep the books of the corporation
outside of the State of Delaware.

 

Section 3.5 _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may
be held without notice at such time and place as shall from time to time be
determined by the Board.

Section 3.6 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of
Directors may be called by the President on forty-eight hours notice to each
director, either personally or by mail, facsimile, telegram or other means of
electronic transmission; special meetings shall be called by the President or
the Secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of two
directors unless the Board consists of only one director; in which case
special meetings shall be called by the President or Secretary in like
manner or on like notice on the written request of the sole director.

 



3 Section 3.7 _Quorum_. At all meetings of the Board of Directors a majority of
the authorized number of directors shall be necessary and sufficient to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the vote of a
majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum,
shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise
specifically provided by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by
these Bylaws. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of
Directors the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to
time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum
shall be present. If only one director is authorized, such sole director shall
constitute a quorum.

 

Section 3.8 _Action Without Meeting_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board
or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing
or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or
committee.

Section 3.9 _Telephonic Meetings_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, members of the Board of
Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may
participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means
of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which
all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such
participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such
meeting.

 

Section 3.10 _Committees of Directors_. The Board of Directors may, by
resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board, designate one or more
committees, each such committee to consist of one or more of the directors of
the corporation. The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate
members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at
any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member
of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not
disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may
unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the
meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such
committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors,
shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of
Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation,
and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers
which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority
in reference to amending the Certificate of Incorporation, adopting an
agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the
sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the
corporations property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a
dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending
the Bylaws of the corporation; and, unless the resolution or the Certificate
of Incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power
or authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock.

Section 3.11 _Minutes of Committee Meetings_. Each committee shall keep
regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors
when required.

 



4 Section 3.12 _Compensation of Directors_. Unless otherwise restricted by
the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the Board of Directors
shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. The directors
may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board
of Directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of
the Board of Directors or a stated salary as director. No such payment shall
preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and
receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees
may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

Section 3.13  _Indemnification_.

(a) The corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended (but in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that
such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights than said law permitted the corporation to provide prior to such
amendment), indemnify any and all persons whom it shall have power to
indemnify under the DGCL from and against any and all of the expenses,
liabilities or other matters referred to in or covered by the DGCL, and the
indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

(b) The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the
fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or
proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo
contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that
the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

(c) The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its
favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,

 



5  partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses
(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted
in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification
shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such
person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and
only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such
action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case,
such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

 

(d) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation shall be successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this
Section 3.13, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of
authorization in the specific case.

(e) Any indemnification under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 3.13
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of
the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances
because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs
(b) and (c) of this Section 3.13. Such determination shall be made (1) by a
majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit
or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) if there are no such
directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders.

 

(f) Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer or director in
defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit
or proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the
corporation as authorized in this section. Such expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms
and conditions, if any, as the board of directors deems appropriate.

(g) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.

 

(h) The Board of Directors may authorize, by a vote of a majority of a quorum
of the Board of Directors, the corporation to purchase and maintain insurance
on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as
a director, officer, employee 

 



6  or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in
any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the
corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under
this Section 3.13.

(i) For purposes of this Section 3.13, references to "the corporation" shall
include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation
(including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or
merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power
and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents,
so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall
stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 3.13 with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with
respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued.

 

(j) For purposes of this Section 3.13, references to "other enterprises" shall
include any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plans or other enterprise of which such person is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving
at the request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or
involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect
to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person
who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation" as referred to in this Section 3.13.

 

(k) For purposes of this Section 3.13, a person shall be deemed to have acted
in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe such
persons conduct was unlawful, if such persons action is based on
the records or books of account of the corporation or another enterprise, or
on information supplied to such person by the officers of the corporation or
another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal
counsel for the corporation or another enterprise or on information or
records given or reports made to the corporation or another enterprise by an
independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert
selected with reasonable care by the corporation or another enterprise. The
provisions of this Section 3.13 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to
limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c)
hereof, as the case may be.

(l) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Section 3.13 shall, unless otherwise provided when
authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

(m) The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with exclusive jurisdiction to hear
and determine all actions for advancement of expenses or indemnification

 



7  brought under this Section 3.13 or under any bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Court of Chancery
may summarily determine a corporations obligation to advance expenses
(including attorneys fees).

(n) Any amendment, repeal, or modification of this Section 3.13 shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of a person entitled to rights or
protection hereunder existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or
modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
such amendment, repeal or modification.

management, business or corporate structure, (iv) any waiver,

 



3  amendment or modification to the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws, or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the
Company by any person, (v) causing a class of securities of the Company to be
delisted from, or to cease to be authorized to be quoted on, any securities
exchange or (vi) causing a class of equity securities of the Company to become
eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the
Exchange Act;

(l) institute, solicit, assist or join any litigation, arbitration or other
proceeding against or involving the Company or any of its current or former
directors or officers (including derivative actions) in order to effect or
take any of the actions expressly prohibited by this paragraph 5; provided,
however, that for the avoidance of doubt the foregoing shall not prevent any
Restricted Person from (A) bringing litigation to enforce the provisions of
this Agreement, (B) making counterclaims with respect to any proceeding
initiated by, or on behalf of, the Company against a Restricted Person, (C)
bringing bona fide commercial disputes that do not relate to the subject
matter of this Agreement or the topics covered in the correspondence between
the Company and the Restricted Persons prior to the date hereof, or (D)
exercising statutory appraisal rights; provided, further, that the foregoing
shall also not prevent the Restricted Persons from responding to or complying
with a validly issued legal process;

 

(m) enter into any negotiations, agreements or understandings with any Third
Party to take any action that the Investors are prohibited from taking
pursuant to this paragraph 5; or

(n) make any request or submit any proposal to amend or waive the terms of
this Agreement, in each case which would reasonably be expected to result in
a public announcement of such request or proposal;

provided, that the restrictions in this paragraph 5 shall terminate
automatically upon the earliest of (i) as a non-exclusive remedy for any such
breach, upon five (5) business days prior written notice by the Investors
following a material breach of this Agreement by the Company (including,
without limitation, a failure to appoint the Investor Designee to the Board in
accordance with paragraph 1 or to the Operating Committee in accordance with
paragraph 4) if such breach has not been cured within such notice
period, provided that the Investors are not in material breach of this
Agreement at the time such notice is given, (ii) the announcement by the
Company of a definitive agreement with respect to any Extraordinary
Transaction that would result in the acquisition by any person or group of
more than 50% of the Voting Securities, (iii) the commencement of any tender
or exchange offer (by a person other than the Investors or their Affiliates)
which, if consummated, would constitute an Extraordinary Transaction that
would result in the acquisition by any person or group of more than 50% of the
Voting Securities, where the Company files a Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment
thereto), other than a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that does not
recommend that the Companys stockholders reject such tender or exchange
offer, (iv) such time as the Company issues a preliminary proxy
statement, definitive proxy statement or other proxy materials in connection
with the 2017 Annual Meeting that are inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement or (v) the adoption by the Board of any amendment to the Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company that would reasonably be expected
to substantially impair the ability of a stockholder to submit nominations for
election to the Board or stockholder proposals in connection with any future
Company Annual Meeting 

 



4  of Stockholders (any of events described in clauses (i) through (v), a "
_Company Event_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing in this paragraph 5 shall prohibit or restrict the
Investor Designee from exercising his rights and fiduciary duties as a
director of the Company or restrict his discussions solely among other members
of the Board and/or management, advisors, representatives or agents of the
Company.

6\. During the Restricted Period, the Company, the Investors and the Investor
Designee shall each refrain from making, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and its and their respective principals, directors, members,
general partners, officers and employees not to make or cause to be made any
statement or announcement including in any document or report filed with or
furnished to the SEC or through the press, media, analysts or other persons,
that constitutes an ad hominem attack on, or otherwise disparages, defames,
slanders, impugns or is reasonably likely to damage the reputation of, (a) in
the case of statements or announcements by any of the Investors: the Company
or any of its Affiliates, subsidiaries or advisors, or any of its or their
respective current or former officers, directors or employees
(including, without limitation, any statements or announcements regarding the
Companys strategy, operations, performance, products or services), and (b) in
the case of statements or announcements by the Company: the Investors and the
Investors advisors, their respective employees or any person who has served
as an employee of the Investors and the Investors advisors. The foregoing
shall not restrict the ability of any person to comply with any subpoena or
other legal process or respond to a request for information from any
governmental authority with jurisdiction over the party from whom information
is sought.

7. The Company hereby agrees that the Investor Designee may provide
confidential information of the Company to the Investors and their Affiliates
subject to, and solely in accordance with the terms of, a confidentiality
agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (which the Investors agree
to execute and deliver to the Company simultaneously with the Investors
execution and delivery of this Agreement). The Investors and the Investor
Designee hereby acknowledge that they and their Affiliates are aware that
United States securities laws may restrict any person who has material, non-
public information about a company from purchasing or selling any securities
of such company while in possession of such information. Accordingly, the
Investors shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, purchase and sell
securities of the Company only in compliance with the Companys insider
trading policy, a copy of which has been provided to the Investors.

 

8\. As used in this Agreement, the term (a) " _Affiliate_ " shall have the
meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act and shall
include Persons who become Affiliates of any Person subsequent to the date of
this Agreement; provided that "Affiliate" shall not include any person that is
a publicly held concern and is otherwise an Affiliate solely by reason of the
fact that an employee or principal of the Investor serves as a member of the
board of directors or similar governing body of such concern; (b) "
_beneficially own_ ", " _beneficially owned_ " and " _beneficial ownership_ "
shall have the meaning set forth in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5(b)(l) promulgated
under the Exchange Act and shall include any other economic exposure to
Company common stock, including through any swap or other derivative
transaction, that gives a Person the economic equivalent of ownership of
Company common stock, including, without limitation, the notional number of
shares subject to derivative agreements in the form of cash-settled swaps;
(c) " _business day_ " shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a
day on

 



5  which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is closed; (d) " _Expiration
Date_ " means the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement; provided
that, if the Investor Designee remains a director of the Company as of such
anniversary date, then the Expiration Date shall be automatically extended
until the earlier of (i) the date that the Board fails to re-nominate the
Investor Designee as a director of the Company in connection with an Annual
Meeting of Stockholders at which the Investor Designees term of office
expires or (ii) the date that the Investor Designee resigns as a director of
the Company (for the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the
Board shall have no obligation to re-nominate the Investor Designee as a
director of the Company [following the 2017 Annual Meeting]1); (e) " _Person_
" shall be interpreted broadly to include, among others, any individual,
general or limited partnership, corporation, limited liability or unlimited
liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, group, association or other
entity of any kind or structure; (f) " _Third Party_ " means any Person that
is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof, a member of the
Board, a director or officer of the Company, or legal counsel to any party to
this Agreement; and (g) " _Voting Securities_ " shall mean the shares of
common stock of the Company and any other securities of the Company entitled
to vote in the election of directors, or securities convertible into, or
exercisable or exchangeable for, such shares or other securities, whether or
not subject to the passage of time or other contingencies.

9\. Each of the Investors, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants
that (a) this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it
and is a valid and binding obligation of such Investor, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms; (b) neither it nor any of its Affiliates has or
will during the Restricted Period have, any agreement, arrangement or
understanding, written or oral, with any member of the Board (other than the
Investor Designee) pursuant to which such individual has been or will be
compensated for his or her service as a director on, or nominee for election
to, the Board; and (c) as of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Investors,
together with all of their respective Affiliates, as of the Closing of
the Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement) will collectively
beneficially own, an aggregate of [ ● ] shares of Voting Securities and (ii)
except as previously disclosed in writing to the Company prior to the
execution of this Agreement, none of the Investors nor any of their
respective Affiliates, is a party to any swap or hedging transactions or other
derivative agreements of any nature with respect to the Voting Securities.

 

10\. The Company represents and warrants that (a) this Agreement has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by it and is a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms; (b) the execution and delivery of this Agreement does not require
the approval of the stockholders of the Company; and (c) the execution and
delivery of this Agreement does not and will not violate any law, any order
of any court or other agency of government, the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, each as amended from time to time, or any provision
of any agreement or other instrument to which the Company or any of its
properties or assets is bound, or conflict with, result in a breach of or
constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any such
agreement or other instrument, or result in the creation or imposition of, or
give rise to, any material lien, charge, restriction, claim, encumbrance or
adverse penalty of any nature whatsoever pursuant to any such indenture,
agreement or other instrument.

designated.

6 11\. The Company and each of the Investors each acknowledge and agree that
money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach (or threatened
breach) of this Agreement by it and that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach hereof, (a) the non-breaching party will be entitled to seek
injunctive and other equitable relief, without proof of actual damages; (b)
the breaching party will not plead in defense thereto that there would be an
adequate remedy at law; and (c) the breaching party agrees to waive any
applicable right or requirement that a bond be posted by the non-breaching
party. Such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this
Agreement, but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or
in equity.

 

12\. This Agreement (including its exhibits) constitutes the only agreement
between the Investors and the Company with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and
discussions, whether oral or written. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No party may assign or otherwise transfer either this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without
the prior written approval of the other party. Any purported transfer
requiring consent without such consent shall be void. No amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party affected thereby,
and then only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose stated
therein. Any waiver by any party of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any other
breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of this
Agreement. The failure of a party to insist upon strict adherence to any term
of this Agreement on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or
deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to
that term or any other term of this Agreement.

13\. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by
any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held
invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain in full force and
effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The parties further
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable provision of this Agreement
with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the purposes of such invalid or unenforceable provision.

 

14\. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware. Each of the Investors and the Company (a)
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the personal jurisdiction and
venue of the federal or state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware; (b)
agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (c) agrees that it
shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or otherwise in any
court other than such courts; and (d) waives any claim of improper venue or
any claim that those courts are an inconvenient forum. The parties agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in paragraph 20 or in such other manner as
may be permitted by applicable law, shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof. Each of the

 



7  parties, after consulting or having had the opportunity to consult with
counsel, knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally waives any right that such
party may have to a trial by jury in any litigation based upon or arising out
of this Agreement or any related instrument or agreement, or any of the
transactions contemplated thereby, or any course of conduct, dealing,
statements (whether oral or written), or actions of any of them. No party
shall seek to consolidate, by counterclaim or otherwise, any action in which a
jury trial has been waived with any other action in which a jury trial cannot
be or has not been waived.

 

15\. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of the parties and is not
enforceable by any other Person.

 

16\. All notices, consents, requests, instructions, approvals and other
communications provided for herein, and all legal process in regard hereto,
will be in writing and will be deemed validly given, made or served when
delivered in person, by electronic mail, by overnight courier or two business
days after being sent by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This letter agreement shall become effective upon the appointment of the
Investor Designee to the Board of Directors (the " _Board_ ") of LogMeIn, Inc.
(the " _Company_ ") pursuant to the other letter agreement, dated as of the
date hereof, between the Company and you (the " _Cooperation Agreement_ ").
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Cooperation Agreement. Subject to the
terms of, and in accordance with, this letter agreement, you and, subject to
the restrictions in paragraph 1, your Representatives and Affiliates, may
receive certain information about the Company and its subsidiaries, divisions
and Affiliates from the Investor Designee that is confidential and
proprietary and the disclosure of which could harm the Company and its
subsidiaries. You understand and agree that disclosure of any such information
by the Investor Designee shall be subject in all cases to his fiduciary
duties to the Company and its stockholders and the Company Policies. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the
Investor Designee shall not disclose to you or your Representatives or
Affiliates (i) any information regarding the deliberations of the Board or
its committees as a whole or of individual members of the Board or its
committees or members of the Companys management (which the parties agree
shall not include factual information regarding the Company and its
subsidiaries, divisions and Affiliates), (ii) any confidential or proprietary
information of any third party in the possession of the Company and its
subsidiaries that either (x) is identified as such to the Investor Designee
by or on behalf of the Company or (y) as to which it is reasonably apparent
that the Company or any of its subsidiaries is obligated by a contractual,
legal or fiduciary obligation prohibiting disclosure or (iii) any
information that may constitute waiver of the Companys or any of its
subsidiaries attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product privilege
(both with respect to internal or external legal counsel) that is identified
as such to the Investor Designee by or on behalf of the Company.

As a condition of your being furnished such information, you agree to treat
any information, whether written or oral, concerning the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, divisions or Affiliates that is furnished to you by or on
behalf of the Investor Designee (herein collectively referred to as the "
_Confidential Information_ ") in accordance with the provisions of this
letter agreement and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions
herein set forth. The term " _Confidential Information_ " includes, without
limitation, all notes, analyses, data or other documents furnished to you or
your Affiliates or Representatives or prepared by you or your Affiliates or
Representatives to the extent such materials reflect or are based upon, in
whole or in part, the Confidential Information. The term " _Confidential
Information_ " does not include information that (a) is or becomes available
to you or the Investor Designee on a nonconfidential basis from a  source other than the Company or its Affiliates or representatives; provided
that such source is not known by you or the Investor Designee to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation to, the Company that prohibits such disclosure, (b) is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by
you or your Representatives or Affiliates in violation of this letter
agreement, or (c) has been or is independently developed by you or your
Representatives or Affiliates without the use of the Confidential Information
or in violation of the terms of this letter agreement. For purposes of this
letter agreement, the term " _Representatives_ " shall include your and your
Affiliates directors, officers, employees and attorneys.

 

1\. You hereby agree that the Confidential Information will be kept
confidential and used solely for the purpose of monitoring and
evaluating your investment in the Company; provided, however, that the
Confidential Information may be disclosed (i) to your Affiliates and any of
your Representatives who need to know such information for the sole purpose of
advising you on your investment in the Company, (ii) in accordance with
paragraph 3 of this letter agreement, or (iii) as the Company may otherwise
consent in writing. All such Affiliates and Representatives shall (A) be
informed by you of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information,
(B) agree to keep the Confidential Information strictly confidential, and (C)
be advised of the terms of this letter agreement. You agree to be responsible
for any breaches of any of the provisions of this letter agreement by any
of your Affiliates or Representatives as if they were party hereto (it being
understood that such responsibility shall be in addition to and not by way of
limitation of any right or remedy the Company may have against your Affiliates
and Representatives with respect to such breach).

2\. You hereby acknowledge that you, your Affiliates and your Representatives
are aware that the Confidential Information may contain material, non-public
information about the Company, and that the U.S. securities laws restrict any
person who has material, non-public information about a company from
purchasing or selling any securities of such company while in possession of
such information, and further acknowledge your obligations and those of your
Affiliates and Representatives under Section 7 of the Cooperation Agreement.

 

3\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this letter
agreement, in the event you or any of your Affiliates or
Representatives receive a request or are required by deposition,
interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or
similar process or pursuant to a formal request from a regulatory examiner
(any such requested or required disclosure, an " _External Demand_ ") or
otherwise pursuant to applicable law, regulation or the rules of any national
securities exchange (as determined based on advice of outside legal counsel)
to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information, agree to, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, (a) promptly notify the Company of the
existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such External Demand or other
requirement, (b) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking
legally available steps to resist or narrow such request or disclosure, and
(c) in the case of any External Demand, assist the Company, at the Companys
request and expense, in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy
to the extent available under the circumstances. In the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained or not available or that the
Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (i) you or your
Affiliates or Representatives, as the case may be, may disclose only that
portion of the Confidential Information which you or your Affiliates or
Representatives are advised by

 



2  counsel is legally required to be disclosed and to the extent you or your
Affiliates or Representatives are advised by counsel is legally required, and,
in the case of any External Demand, you or your Affiliates or Representatives
shall, at the Companys request and expense, exercise reasonable efforts to
obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
Confidential Information, and (ii) you or your Affiliates or Representatives
shall not be liable for such disclosure, unless such disclosure was caused by
or resulted from a previous disclosure by you or your Affiliates or
Representatives in violation of this letter agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, except in the case of an External Demand, you and your Affiliates
and Representatives may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to this
paragraph 3 if but only if such disclosure requirement does not arise from a
breach of paragraph 9 of the Cooperation Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is understood and agreed that there shall be no "applicable law",
"regulation" or "rule" requiring you or your Affiliates or Representatives to
disclose any Confidential Information solely by virtue of the fact that,
absent such disclosure, you or your Affiliates or Representatives would be
prohibited from purchasing, selling or engaging in derivative or other
voluntary transactions with respect to the securities of the Company or you
or your Affiliates or Representatives would be unable to file any proxy
materials in compliance with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act or the rules
promulgated thereunder.

 

4\. Upon the Companys demand, you shall either promptly (at your option) (a)
destroy the Confidential Information and any copies thereof, or (b) return to
the Company all Confidential Information and any copies thereof, and, in
either case, confirm in writing to the Company that all such material has been
destroyed or returned, as applicable, in compliance with this letter
agreement, provided that (i) you and your Affiliates and Representatives
shall be permitted to retain Confidential Information to the extent necessary
to comply with applicable law or such persons document retention policies
designed to ensure compliance with applicable law and (ii) the foregoing
shall not require the deletion of Confidential Information from computer
archives maintained in the ordinary course (provided that you and your
Affiliates and Representatives shall continue to be bound by the obligations
of confidentiality hereunder with respect to such Confidential Information for
such period of time as you and such Affiliates or Representatives retain such
Confidential Information).

 

5\. You acknowledge and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient
remedy for any breach (or threatened breach) of this letter agreement by you
or your Affiliates or Representatives and that the Company shall be entitled
to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a
remedy for any such breach (or threatened breach), without proof of damages,
and each party further agrees to waive, and use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its Affiliates to waive any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with any such remedy. Such remedies shall not be the
exclusive remedies for a breach of this letter agreement, but will be in
addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.

6\. You agree that (a) none of the Company or their respective Affiliates or
representatives shall have any liability to you or any of your Affiliates or
Representatives resulting from the selection, use or content of the
Confidential Information by you or your Affiliates or Representatives and (b)
none of the Company or their respective Affiliates or representatives makes
any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any Confidential Information. This letter agreement shall not
create any

 



3  obligation on the part of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Affiliates
or representatives to provide you or your Affiliates or Representatives with
any Confidential Information, nor shall it entitle you or your Affiliates or
Representatives (other than the Investor Designee in his capacity as a
director of the Company) to participate in any Board or committee meetings.
All Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Neither you nor any of your Affiliates or Representatives shall
by virtue of any disclosure of and/or your or their use of any Confidential
Information acquire any rights with respect thereto, all of which rights
shall remain exclusively with the Company and its subsidiaries.

7\. No failure or delay by any party or any of its representatives in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this letter agreement shall
operate as a waiver thereof, and no modification hereof shall be effective,
unless in writing and signed by the parties.

 

8\. The illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof
under the laws of any jurisdiction shall not affect its legality, validity or
enforceability under the laws of any other jurisdiction, nor the legality,
validity or enforceability of any other provision.

 

9\. This letter agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware. The parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Courts
in the State of Delaware and the United States District Court for the District
of the State of Delaware for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this letter agreement, and agree not to commence any action,
suit or proceeding related thereto except in such courts.

10. This letter agreement and the Cooperation Agreement (including the
exhibits thereto) contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether written or oral. This
letter agreement may be amended only by an agreement in writing executed by
the parties hereto.

 

11\. This letter agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute the
same agreement. One or more counterparts of this letter agreement may be
delivered by telecopier or pdf electronic transmission, with the intention
that they shall have the same effect as an original counterpart hereof.

 

12\. Except as otherwise set forth herein, this letter agreement shall
terminate three (3) years from the date on which the Investor Designee ceases
to be a director of the Company; provided that you and your Affiliates shall
maintain in accordance with the confidentiality obligations set forth herein
any Confidential Information constituting trade secrets for such longer time
as such information constitutes a trade secret of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries under applicable law; and provided further that any liability for
breach of this letter agreement prior to such termination shall survive such
termination.
