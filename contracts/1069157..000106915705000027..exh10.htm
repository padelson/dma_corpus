 "Average Share Price" shall mean the volume weighted average of the closing

the Effective Time.

 

 "Stock Portion" shall mean the number of shares of EWBC Common Stock
issuable in the Merger derived as follows:

 

 

     *   |  

If  the Average Share Price is less than $29.00, then the Stock Portion

either  60% or 70% of the Merger Consideration by $29.00, with the
determination  of the Stock Portion percentage to be provided by the
Principal  Shareholder concurrently in the writing to be delivered to EWBC on

its securities portfolio on the date hereof.

 

 

(ii) EWBC shall set aside cash from the Cash Portion and the Stock Portion

EWBC shall deliver to U. S. Stock Transfer Corporation (the "Exchange Agent")
the remaining Stock Portion and Cash Portion. Each share of UNB Common Stock
(except for Dissenters' Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and Per Share Stock Consideration.

 

 

(iii) At the Effective Time, each share of UNB Common Stock shall be
converted into, and become exchangeable for, the Per Share Merger
Consideration and the holders of certificates formerly representing shares of
UNB Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as UNB shareholders. Except
as provided above, until such certificates are surrendered for exchange, the
certificates of each holder shall, after the Effective Time, represent for
all purposes only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

 

(iv) If, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective
Time, the outstanding shares of EWBC Common Stock shall, through a
reclassification, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or reverse

different number or kind of shares or securities, appropriate adjustment will
be made to the Stock Portion.

 

 

(b) _Stock Transfer Books and Exchange_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of UNB shall be closed as to holders of UNB Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of UNB Common Stock
by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized on the stock
transfer books of UNB or the Surviving Bank. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates are properly presented in accordance with Article 3 of this
Agreement to the Exchange Agent, such certificates shall be canceled and
exchanged for certificates representing the number of whole shares of EWBC
Common Stock and a check representing the amount of cash into which UNB
Common Stock represented thereby was converted in the Merger, plus any
payment for a fractional share of EWBC Common Stock. 

 

 

(c) _Calculations_. Any calculation of a portion of a share of EWBC Common
Stock shall be rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share, and any cash
payment shall be rounded to the nearest cent. For purposes of this Section
3.02, the shares of EWBC Common Stock issued for UNB Common Stock as
consideration in the Merger shall be deemed to be "approximately equal" to
the Stock Portion if such number is within 1,000 shares of EWBC Common Stock
of such amount.

 

 

SECTION 3.03 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fractional shares of EWBC Common Stock and no certificates or
scrip therefore, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued
in the Merger; instead, EWBC shall pay to each holder of UNB Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of EWBC Common Stock (after
taking into account all certificates of UNB Common Stock delivered by such
holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such
fraction by the Average Share Price. No holder will be entitled to dividends,
voting rights or any other rights as a shareholder in respect of any
fractional share of EWBC Common Stock.

 

 

SECTION 3.04 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. No later than the Effective Time, EWBC shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, the Stock Portion and the Cash Portion of the
Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall not be
entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to EWBC
Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall
receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed
with respect to such shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto.

 

 

(b) _Exchange of Certificates and Cash_. Each holder of a certificate
formerly representing UNB Common Stock (other than Dissenters' Shares or
Treasury Shares) who surrenders or has surrendered such certificate (or
customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of
such certificate), together with duly executed transmittal materials, to the
Exchange Agent shall, upon acceptance thereof, be entitled to a certificate
representing EWBC Common Stock and cash into which the shares of UNB Common
Stock shall have been converted pursuant hereto, as well as cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of EWBC Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such UNB certificate
upon compliance with such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as
the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal practices. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.04, each certificate representing UNB Common Stock shall be deemed
from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive cash
and EWBC Common Stock upon such surrender. EWBC shall not be obligated to
deliver the consideration to which any former holder of UNB Common Stock is
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders his
certificate or certificates representing such shares of UNB Common Stock
for exchange as provided herein. If any certificate for shares of UNB Common
Stock, or any check representing cash and/or declared but unpaid dividends,
is to be issued in a name other than that in which a certificate surrendered
for exchange is issued, the certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and the person requesting
such exchange shall affix any requisite stock transfer tax stamps to the
certificate surrendered or provide funds for their purchase or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such taxes are not payable.

 

 

(c) _Affiliates_. Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person
constituting an "affiliate" of EWBC for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act, shall not be exchanged for certificates representing whole
shares of EWBC Common Stock until EWBC has received a written agreement from
such person.

 

 

(d) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange
Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of UNB Common
Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

 

(e) _Voting and Dividends_. Former shareholders of record of UNB shall not
be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of EWBC
shareholders until such holders have exchanged their certificates
representing UNB Common Stock for certificates representing EWBC Common Stock
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Until surrendered for
exchange in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.04, each
certificate previously representing shares of UNB Common Stock (other than
Dissenters' Shares and Treasury Shares) shall from and after the Effective
Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive shares of EWBC
Common Stock, cash and cash in lieu of fractional shares, as set forth in
this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after
the Effective Time with respect to EWBC Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered certificate of UNB Common Stock with respect to the shares of
EWBC Common Stock represented thereby, until the holder of such certificate
of UNB Common Stock shall surrender such certificate. Subject to the effect
of applicable laws, following surrender of any such certificates of UNB
Common Stock for which shares of EWBC Common Stock are to be issued, there
shall be paid to the holder of the certificates without interest, (i) the
amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of EWBC Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.03 and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of EWBC
Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable
with respect to such whole shares of EWBC Common Stock. 

 

 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. EWBC or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of UNB Common Stock such amounts as EWBC or
the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by EWBC or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of UNB Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by EWBC or
the Exchange Agent.

 

 

SECTION 3.05 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event EWBC or UNB changes
(or establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of
EWBC Common Stock or UNB Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization
or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding EWBC Common Stock or
UNB Common Stock, as the case may be, and the record date therefore shall be
prior to the Effective Date, the Stock Portion and Per Share Stock
Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted. If, between the date hereof
and the Effective Time, EWBC shall merge, be acquired or consolidate with, by
or into any other corporation (a "Business Combination") and the terms
thereof shall provide that EWBC Common Stock shall be converted into or
exchanged for the shares of any other corporation or entity, then provision
shall be made as part of the terms of such Business Combination so that
shareholders of UNB who would be entitled to receive shares of EWBC Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of
each share of EWBC Common Stock issuable to such shareholders as provided
herein, the same kind and amount of securities or assets as shall be
distributable upon such Business Combination with respect to one share of
EWBC Common Stock (provided that nothing herein shall be construed so as to
release the acquiring entity in any such Business Combination from
its obligations under this Agreement as the successor to EWBC).

 

 

SECTION 3.06 _Dissenters ' Rights_.

 

 

(a) Any Dissenting Shareholder who shall be entitled to be paid the value of
such shareholder's shares of UNB Common Stock, as provided in 12 U.S.C.
Section 214a, shall not be entitled to the Merger Consideration in respect
thereof provided for under Section 3.02 unless and until such Dissenting
Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such Dissenting Shareholder's right to dissent from the Merger under
the National Bank Act, and shall be entitled to receive only the payment
provided for by 12

 

 Section U.S.C. 214a with respect to such Dissenters' Shares.

 

 

(b) If any Dissenting Shareholder shall fail to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to dissent, each share of UNB Common
Stock of such Dissenting Shareholder shall be converted at EWBC's discretion
into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration or the Per Share
Stock Consideration to be necessary or appropriate to preserve the status of
the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would
constitute such a default. No power of attorney or similar authorization

Schedule 5.03(k) also sets forth a true and complete list of all third party

(m) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

 

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements
covering current or former employees, including officers, of UNB and current
or former directors, consultants and other service providers of UNB
including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA, and deferred compensation, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans
(the "Benefit Plans"), are set forth in UNB Disclosure Schedule 5.03(m). True
and complete copies of all Benefit Plans and all amendments thereto and all
documents related thereto have been provided or made available to EWBC,
including but not limited to (i) the Form 5500 for each Benefit Plan (if
applicable) for each of the three most recent plan years for which such forms
are required to have been filed, (ii) the most recent determination letter
from the IRS (if applicable) for such Benefit Plan, (iii) a copy of the most
recent summary plan description required for such Benefit Plan under ERISA
(if applicable), (iv) a copy of the trust instruments(s), insurance
contract(s) and other funding agreement(s) forming a part of any Benefit
Plan, and (v) the latest financial statements of the Benefit Plan (if
applicable).

 

 

(ii) All Benefits Plans have been operated and administered in accordance
with their terms and applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA and
the Code. Except as set forth on UNB Disclosure Schedule 5.03(m)(ii), each
Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA ("Pension Plan") and which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code does so qualify, and UNB has
received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to such qualification covering all tax law changes with respect
to which Internal Revenue Service determination letters can be issued, and no
circumstances have occurred that are likely to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter or the loss of the qualification of such
Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. There is no pending or
threatened litigation relating to any of the Benefits Plans. Neither UNB nor
any ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) has engaged in a transaction, taken
any action or failed to take any action or to meet any requirement with
respect to any Benefit Plan or Pension Plan that, assuming the taxable period
of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject UNB to a tax
or penalty imposed by any of Sections 4971, 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4978,
4979, 4980, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E, 4980F, or 4980G, of the Code or Sections 409
or 502(i) of ERISA.

 

 

(iii) No liability under of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by UNB with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-
employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently
or formerly maintained by it, or the single-employer plan of any entity which
is considered one employer with UNB under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section
414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"), and UNB is not aware of any condition
that presents a significant risk to UNB or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring
any liability thereunder. Neither UNB nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever
participated in any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37)
of ERISA. UNB has not incurred, and does it not expect to incur, any
withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA
Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section
4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived,
has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate
within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or will be required to
be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Benefit
Plan have been timely made. All contributions to each Benefit Plan in respect
of all current and prior plan years have been accrued in accordance with GAAP
and are reflected in UNB's financial statements. Neither any Pension Plan nor
any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA, and neither UNB nor any ERISA Affiliate has an
outstanding funding waiver. UNB has not provided, nor is it required to
provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an
ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

 

 

(v) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last
day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in the Pension Plan's most recent actuarial
valuation and on a termination basis), did not exceed the lesser of the
actuarial value or the then current value of the assets of such Pension Plan,
and there has been no material change in the financial condition of such
Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year.

 

 

(vi) UNB has no obligations to provide any current or former employee,
officer, director, consultant or other service provider health, disability or
life benefits beyond his or her retirement or other termination of service
under any Benefit Plan, other than healthcare continuation coverage mandated
by applicable law. UNB may amend or terminate any Benefit Plan at any time
without incurring any liability thereunder.

 

 

(vii) Except as set forth on UNB Disclosure Schedule 5.03(m)(vii), none of
the execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either
alone or in combination with any other event, (A) entitle any current or
former employee, officer, director, consultant or other service provider of
UNB to severance pay or any other payment or benefit, or any increase in
severance pay or any other payment or benefit upon any termination of
employment or other relationship after the date hereof, (B) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
the Benefit Plans, (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default
under, any of the Benefit Plans or (D) result in any payment that would be a
"parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as those terms are defined
in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to whether such payment is
reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in
the future. UNB Disclosure Schedule 5.03(m)(vii) categorizes any such
exceptions according to the categories above and sets forth the amounts
of any such payments to the persons listed thereon.

 

 

(viii) No Benefit Plan that is subject to section 409A of the Code fails to
meet any requirement of section 409A of the Code that would result in any
Benefit Plan participant having liability for additional interest or the 20%
addition to tax under such section of the Code.

 

 

(n) _Labor Matters_. UNB is not a party to nor bound by any collective
bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding with a
labor union or labor organization, nor is it the subject of a proceeding
asserting that it has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning
of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel UNB to bargain with
any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there
any strike or other labor dispute involving it or, to UNB's knowledge,
threatened, nor is UNB aware of any activity involving its employees seeking
to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational
activity.

result in liability to UNB arising out of any Environmental Law; (iii)

biphenyls, prior manufacturing operations, dry-cleaning, or automotive
services) involving UNB, any currently or formerly owned or operated
property, or any UNB Loan Property, that could reasonably be expected to
result in any claims, liability or investigations against UNB, result in any
restrictions on the ownership, use, or transfer of any property pursuant to
any Environmental Law, or adversely affect the value of any UNB Loan Property
and (viii) UNB has made available to EWBC copies of all environmental
reports, studies, sampling data, correspondence, filings and other

and existing and in full force and effect, and no party thereto is in default
and no notice of a claim of default by any party has been delivered to UNB or
is now pending, and there does not exist any event that with notice or the
passing of time, or both, would constitute a default or excuse performance by
any party thereto, provided that with respect to matters relating to any
party other than UNB, the foregoing representation is based on the knowledge

respects performed all the obligations required to be performed by it and is
not in default in any material respect under any contract, agreement,
arrangement or commitment relating to any of the foregoing.

of its Subsidiaries are not in compliance with any of the statutes,

(q) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

 

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements

Subsidiaries and current or former directors, consultants and other service
providers of EWBC and its Subsidiaries including, but not limited to,
"employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, and
deferred compensation, stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation
rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans (the "EWBC Benefits Plans")
have been operated and administered in accordance with their terms and
applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code. Except as
set forth on EWBC Disclosure Schedule 5.05(q), each EWBC Benefit Plan that is
a Pension Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code does so qualify, and EWBC and its Subsidiaries, where applicable, have
received favorable determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to such qualification covering all tax law changes with respect
to which Internal Revenue Service determination letters can be issued, and no
circumstances have occurred that are likely to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter or the loss of the qualification of such
Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. There is no pending or
threatened litigation relating to any of the EWBC Benefits Plans. Neither
EWBC, its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate of EWBC has engaged in
a transaction, taken any action or failed to take any action or to meet
any requirement with respect to any EWBC Benefit Plan that, assuming the
taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could
subject EWBC or its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by any of
Sections 4971, 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4978, 4979, 4980, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E,
4980F, or 4980G, of the Code or Sections 409 or 502(i) of ERISA.

 

 

(ii) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by EWBC or its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or
terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15)
of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by it, or the single-employer plan
of any entity which is considered one employer with EWBC under Section 4001
of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate of EWBC"), and EWBC
is not aware of any condition that presents a significant risk to EWBC, its
Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate of EWBC of incurring any liability
thereunder. Neither EWBC, its Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate of EWBC
has ever participated in any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA. EWBC and its Subsidiaries have not incurred, nor do
they expect to incur, any withdrawal liability with respect to a
multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate of EWBC).

 

 

(iii) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any EWBC
Benefit Plan have been timely made. All contributions to each EWBC Benefit
Plan in respect of all current and prior plan years have been accrued in
accordance with GAAP and are reflected in EWBC and its Subsidiaries'
financial statements. Neither any EWBC Benefit Plan that is a Pension Plan
nor any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate of EWBC has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning
of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, and neither EWBC, its
Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate of EWBC has an outstanding funding
waiver. Neither EWBC nor any of its Subsidiaries have provided, nor are they
required to provide, security to any EWBC Benefit Plan that is a Pension Plan
or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code.

 

 

(iv) Under each EWBC Benefit Plan that is a Pension Plan which is a single-
employer plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to
the date hereof, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in the Pension
Plan's most recent actuarial valuation and on a termination basis), did not
exceed the lesser of the actuarial value or the then current value of the
assets of such Pension Plan, and there has been no material change in the
financial condition of such Pension Plan since the last day of the most
recent plan year.

 

 

(v) Neither EWBC nor any of its Subsidiaries have obligations to provide any
of their current or former employees, officers, directors, consultants or
other service providers health, disability or life benefits beyond his or her
retirement or other termination of service under any EWBC Benefit Plan, other
than healthcare continuation coverage mandated by applicable law.

 

 

(r) _Labor Matters_. Neither EWBC nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement
or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor are any of
them the subject of a proceeding asserting that they have committed an unfair
labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or
seeking to compel EWBC or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike
or other labor dispute involving it or, to EWBC's and EWB's knowledge,
threatened, nor is either aware of any activity involving its employees

organizational activity.

the applicable period specified in 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code;

 

 

(P) Neither EWBC nor any of its Subsidiaries have engaged in a "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4; and

 

 

(Q) as of the date hereof, neither EWBC nor any of its Subsidiaries have
reason to believe that any conditions exist or will exist that might prevent
or impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

 

(t) _Risk Management Instruments_. Neither EWBC nor any of its Subsidiaries
are parties to or have they agreed to enter Derivatives Contracts or own
securities that (i) are referred to generically as "structured notes," "high
risk mortgage derivatives," "capped floating rate notes" or "capped floating
rate mortgage derivatives" nor (ii) are likely to have changes in value as a
result of interest or exchange rate changes that significantly exceed normal
changes in value attributable to interest or exchange rate changes, except
for those Derivatives Contracts and other instruments legally purchased or
entered into in the ordinary course of business, consistent with safe and
sound banking practices and regulatory guidance. All of such Derivatives
Contracts or other instruments, are legal, valid and binding obligations of
EWBC or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, enforceable in accordance with
their terms (except as enforcement may be limited by general principles of
equity whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity and by
bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and
remedies generally), and are in full force and effect. EWBC and its
Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of their
material obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to
perform have accrued; and, to EWBC's and its Subsidiaries' knowledge, there
are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such
by any party thereunder which have had or could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on EWBC or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(u) _Books and Records_. The books and records of EWBC and its Subsidiaries
have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in all material respects,
and there are no material inaccuracies or discrepancies of any kind contained
or reflected therein, and they fairly present the financial position of EWBC
and its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(v) _Allowance For Loan Losses_. EWB's ALL is, and shall be as of the
Effective Date, in compliance with EWB's existing methodology for determining
the adequacy of its ALL as well as the standards established by applicable
Governmental Authorities and the Financial Accounting Standards Board and is
and shall be adequate under all such standards.

 

 

(w) _Trust Business_. EWB does not have trust powers.

 

 

(x) _Real Property_.

 

 

(i) None of the real property or premises owned on the date hereof, in whole
or in part by EWBC or its Subsidiaries and the real property or premises
leased in whole or in part by EWBC or its Subsidiaries have been condemned or
otherwise taken by any public authority and no condemnation or taking is
threatened or contemplated and none thereof is subject to any claim, contract
or law which might affect its use or value for the purposes now made of it.
None of the premises or properties of EWBC or its Subsidiaries are subject to
any current or potential interests of third parties or other restrictions or
limitations that would impair or be inconsistent in any material respect with
the current use of such property by EWBC or its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be.

 

 

(ii) Each of the leases referred to in Section 5.05(x)(i) is valid and
existing and in full force and effect, and no party thereto is in default and
no notice of a claim of default by any party has been delivered to EWBC or
its Subsidiaries or is now pending, and there does not exist any event that
with notice or the passing of time, or both, would constitute a default or
excuse performance by any party thereto, provided that with respect to
matters relating to any party other than EWBC and its Subsidiaries, the
foregoing representation is based on the knowledge of EWBC and the knowledge
of EWB.

 

 

(y) _Title_. EWBC and its Subsidiaries have good title to their properties
and assets (other than (i) property as to which EWBC or its Subsidiaries is
lessee and (ii) real estate owned as a result of foreclosure, transfer in
lieu of foreclosure or other transfer in satisfaction of a debtor's
obligation previously contracted) except (1) statutory Liens not yet
delinquent which are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings, and Liens for taxes not yet due, (2) pledges of assets in the
ordinary course of business to secure public deposits, (3) for those assets
and properties disposed of for fair value in the ordinary course of business
since the date of EWB's call report dated as of and for the quarter ended
March 31, 2005 and (4) defects and irregularities of title and encumbrances
that do not materially impair the use thereof for the purposes for which they
are held.

 

 

(z) _Intellectual Property_. EWBC and its Subsidiaries own or possess valid
and binding licenses and other rights to use (without payment) all material
trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, inventions and
processes used in their respective businesses; and neither EWBC nor any of
its Subsidiaries have received notice of conflict with respect thereto that
asserts a right of others. EWBC and its Subsidiaries have in all material
respects performed all the obligations required to be performed by them and
are not in default in any material respect under any contract, agreement,
arrangement or commitment relating to any of the foregoing.

SECTION 6.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of EWBC, EWB, UNB and the
Principal Shareholder agrees to use their reasonable best efforts in good
faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under
applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as
practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Article VII hereof, and shall cooperate fully with the other parties
hereto to that end.

 

 

SECTION 6.02 _Private Placement and SEC Form S-3 Registration_. The EWBC
Common Stock to be exchanged for the UNB Common Stock shall be
issued pursuant to Regulation D and Rule 506 of the Securities Act. As
expeditiously as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event
within thirty (30) days after the Effective Time, EWBC shall:

 

 

(a) Prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement under the
Securities Act covering the resale of the EWBC Common Stock issued pursuant
to the Agreement and the Merger hereunder (the "Registration Statement") and
use its best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become and
remain effective for two years from the Effective Time and shall use its best
efforts to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC in preparing and
filing such Registration Statement;

 

 

(b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective
amendments to the Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep the
Registration Statement effective for a period of not less than one year from
the date of issuance of the EWB Common covered by such Registration
Statement;

 

 

(c) Make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal of any order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement at the earliest
practicable time;

 

 

(d) On or prior to the date on which the Registration Statement is declared
effective, use its best efforts to register or qualify the EWBC Common Stock
covered by such Registration Statement under all applicable state laws;

 

 

(e) Use its reasonable best efforts to list, on the Nasdaq the shares of
EWBC Common Stock to be issued to the Shareholders in the Merger.

 

 All of the costs and expenses of each registration hereunder will be borne
by EWBC, including all registration and filing fees, the fees and expenses of
EWBC's counsel and accountants.

 

 

SECTION 6.03 _Press Releases_. EWBC, UNB and the Principal
Shareholder shall consult with each other before issuing any press release
with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statements without the prior consent of
the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however,
that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after
such consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue
such press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice of
outside counsel be required by law or the rules or regulations of Nasdaq.
EWBC and UNB shall cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and
make appropriate management available at presentations related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by the
other party.

 

 

SECTION 6.04 _Access; Information_.

 

 

(a) UNB agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford EWBC and EWBC's
officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives such access during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without
limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties
and personnel and to such other information as EWBC may reasonably request
and, during such period, it shall furnish promptly to EWBC all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as EWBC may reasonably
request.

 

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.04(a), prior to the
Effective Time, EWBC and its respective representatives shall have the right
to conduct a review to determine (i) that the assets, books, records and
operations of UNB are in satisfactory condition and will not in a material
way adversely impact EWBC after consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties and the
satisfaction of the conditions to closing as provided hereunder.

 

 

(c) UNB agrees that, subject to applicable laws, it shall cooperate in good
faith with EWBC on mutually agreed operating issues which the parties agree
have priority. 

 

 

(d) EWBC agrees that, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford UNB and its
authorized representatives such access to EWBC's books and records as UNB may
reasonably request.

 

 

(e) Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause its representatives
not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.04 (as well
as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with
the entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to
the requirements of law, each party shall keep confidential, and shall cause
its representatives to keep confidential, all information and documents
obtained pursuant to this Section 6.04 (as well as any other information
obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the entering into of
this Agreement) unless such information (i) was already known to such party,
(ii) becomes available to such party from other sources not known by such
party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is disclosed with
the prior written approval of the party to which such information pertains or
(iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable from publicly available sources. In
the event that this Agreement is terminated or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall otherwise fail to be consummated, (A) each party
shall promptly cause all copies of documents or extracts thereof containing
information and data as to another party hereto to be returned to the party
which furnished the same; (B) neither UNB or the Principal Shareholder, on
the one hand, nor EWBC or EWB, on the other hand, shall, and each of the
parties shall cause its respective representatives not to, use any
confidential information to solicit customers of the other party; and (C) for
one year after such termination, neither UNB or the Principal Shareholder, on
the one hand, nor EWBC or EWB, on the other hand, shall, and each of the
parties shall cause its respective representatives not to, solicit the
services of any employee of such other party for purposes of engaging them as
an employee, agent, consultant or independent contractor of such
soliciting party, provided, however, that neither party will be barred from
retaining the services, in any capacity, of any current employee of the other
party in the event such employee approaches such party with the intent of
securing employment with such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein shall prevent the parties hereto from any general advertising or
recruitment activities not directed specifically at the employees of the
other party hereto. No investigation by any party of the business and affairs
of any other party shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the
conditions to any party's obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 6.05 _Affiliate Letter and Investor Letter_.
Principal Shareholder shall deliver to EWBC, no later than 20 days prior to
the Effective Date, (i) the Investor Letter, and (ii) as an "affiliate" of
UNB within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the
Securities Act or SEC Accounting Releases 130 and 135, an affiliate letter,
substantially in the form of _Exhibit F_ hereto (the "Affiliate Letter").

 

 

SECTION 6.06 _Acquisition Proposals_. Principal Shareholder agrees not to
and UNB agrees that their officers or directors shall not, and
Principal Shareholder and UNB agree they shall direct and use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their employees, agents and representatives
not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or otherwise encourage any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction
involving, or any purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of UNB
or more than 10% of the outstanding equity securities, of UNB (any such
proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition
Proposal"). Principal Shareholder and UNB further agree that neither
Principal Shareholder nor UNB nor any of their officers and directors shall,
and that they shall direct and use their reasonable best efforts to cause
their employees, agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or
attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal. UNB agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposals. UNB agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals referred to in the
foregoing sentence of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.06. UNB
agrees that it will notify EWBC promptly, but in no event later than the
second succeeding Business Day, if any such inquiries, proposals or offers
are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, any
of its representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name
of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or
offer.

 

 

SECTION 6.07 _Certain Policies_. Prior to the Effective Date, UNB shall,
consistent with GAAP and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or
change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real
estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and
levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with
that of EWBC. 

 

 

SECTION 6.08 _Regulatory Applications_.

 

 

(a) Each of EWBC and the UNB shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, or cause to be filed, all
documentation, to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third parties and/or Governmental
Authorities in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and any initial filings with
Governmental Authorities (other than the Registration Statement) shall be
made by EWBC as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution hereof
but, provided that UNB has cooperated as described above, in no event later
than 45 days after the date hereof. Each of EWBC and UNB shall have the
right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult
with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, with respect to all material written
information submitted to any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  In exercising the foregoing right, each of such parties agrees to
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that
it shall consult with the other parties hereto with respect to the obtaining
of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and/or Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party shall keep the
other parties apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby (including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received
by EWBC or UNB, as the case may be, from any third party and/or Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement).

 

 

(b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other parties with all
information known to it (which knowledge shall be deemed to include knowledge
which could be acquired after reasonable due inquiry) concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, advisory directors, officers and shareholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such other
parties to any third party or Governmental Authority.

 

 

SECTION 6.09 _Indemnification by EWBC_.

 

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, EWBC or EWB shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each present and former director and officer of UNB (each, an
"Indemnified Party") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or any related agreement, but excluding any
Costs arising out of any violation or alleged violation of the Exchange Act
or the rules and regulations thereunder) to the same extent as directors or
officers under the EWB Articles and the EWB By-Laws, as in effect on the date
hereof; provided that any determination required to be made with respect to
whether an officer's or director's conduct complies with the standards set
forth in the EWB Articles or the EWB By-Laws shall be made by independent
counsel selected by EWBC and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;
and provided, further, that in the absence of judicial precedent to the
contrary, such counsel, in making such determination, shall presume such
officer's or director's conduct complied with such standard and EWBC shall
have the burden to demonstrate that such officer's or director's conduct
failed to comply with such standard.

 

 For a period of one year from the Effective Time, EWBC shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that portion of director's and
officer's liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former
officers and directors (determined as of the Effective Time) of UNB (as
opposed to the portion that serves to reimburse UNB) with respect to claims
against such directors and officers arising from facts or events which
occurred before the Effective Time, which insurance shall contain at least
the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by UNB; provided _,_
however, that if EWBC is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called
for by this Section 6.09(a) without exceeding the aggregate $200,000 limit on
Transaction Expenses, EWBC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available; provided, further, that
officers and directors of UNB may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to EWBC's insurance carrier for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance.

 

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.09(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify EWBC thereof; provided
that the failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of EWBC under
Section 6.09(a) unless and to the extent that EWBC is actually prejudiced as
a result of such failure. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) EWBC shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and EWBC
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal expenses or other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof _, _ provided, however _,_ that any
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel to represent such
Indemnified Party if (A) the Indemnified Party and EWBC shall have so
mutually agreed; (B) EWBC has failed within a reasonable time to retain
counsel; (C) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there
may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition
to those available to EWBC; or (D) the named parties in any such proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party, on the
one hand, and EWBC or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, and
representation of both sets of parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them,
and in any such events the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall
be paid by EWBC; (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of
any such matter and (iii) EWBC shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, further, that EWBC
shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when
a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of
such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law.

 

 

(c) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, EWBC and EWB
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Principal Shareholder from and
against all Costs incurred by the Principal Shareholder resulting from or
arising out of any inaccuracy in or any breach of any representation,
warranty, or covenant of EWBC or its Subsidiaries contained in Section 5.05
of this Agreement. 

 

 

(d) Promptly after receipt by the Principal Shareholder of notice of any
demand, claim or circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would give rise
to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action,
proceeding or investigation that may result in the incurrence of such Costs,
the Principal Shareholder shall promptly provide EWBC notice of such demand
or claim; provided that the failure so to notify shall not affect the
obligations of EWBC under Section 6.09(c) unless and to the extent that EWBC
is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (i) EWBC shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and EWBC shall not be liable to the Principal Shareholder for
any legal expenses or other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by the Principal Shareholder in connection with the defense thereof
_,_ provided, however _,_  that the Principal Shareholder shall have the
right to employ counsel to represent the Principal Shareholder if (A) the
Principal Shareholder and EWBC shall have so mutually agreed; (B) EWBC has
failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel; (C) the Principal
Shareholder shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to
EWBC; or (D) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Principal Shareholder, on the one hand,
and EWBC, on the other hand, and representation of both sets of parties by
the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between them, and in any such events the fees and expenses of such
separate counsel shall be paid by EWBC; (ii) the Principal Shareholder will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) EWBC shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; provided,
further, that EWBC shall not have any obligation hereunder to the Principal
Shareholder if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final, that
the indemnification of the Principal Shareholder in the manner contemplated
hereby is prohibited by applicable law.

 

 

(e) If EWBC or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with
or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of EWBC shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.09.

 

 

SECTION 6.10 _Indemnification by Principal Shareholder_.

 

 

(a) Principal Shareholder shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless EWBC and
EWB (and their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and
assigns) from and against all Costs incurred by EWBC or EWB resulting from or
arising out of any inaccuracy in or any breach of any representation or
warranty of the Principal Shareholder contained in Section 5.04 of this
Agreement.

 

 

(b) Promptly after receipt by EWBC of notice of any demand, claim or
circumstances which, with the lapse of time, would give rise to a claim or
the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or
investigation that may result in the incurrence of such Costs, EWBC shall
promptly provide the Principal Shareholder notice of such demand or claim;
provided that the failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of
the Principal Shareholder under Section 6.10(a) unless and to the extent that
the Principal Shareholder is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.
In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Principal
Shareholder shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the
Principal Shareholder shall not be liable to EWBC for any legal expenses or
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by the Principal
Shareholder in connection with the defense thereof _,_ provided, however _,_
that EWBC shall have the right to employ counsel to represent EWBC if (A)
EWBC and the Principal Shareholder shall have so mutually agreed; (B) EWBC
has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel; (C) EWBC shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that
are different from or in addition to those available to the Principal
Shareholder; or (D) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any
impleaded parties) include both EWBC, on the one hand, and the Principal
Shareholder, on the other hand, and representation of both sets of parties by
the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between them, and in any such events the fees and expenses of such
separate counsel shall be paid by the Principal Shareholder; (ii) EWBC will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) the Principal
Shareholder shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed; provided, further, that the Principal Shareholder shall not have any
obligation hereunder to EWBC if and when a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final,
that the indemnification of EWBC in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable law.

 

 

SECTION 6.11 _Benefit Plans_.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, UNB shall take all action necessary to
terminate any and all 401(k) Plans UNB maintains and any other Benefit Plan
that EWB may specify.

 

 

(b) EWB agrees that as of and following the Effective Time, the employees of
UNB as of the Effective Time who are offered and who accept employment with
EWBC or EWB (the "Former UNB Employees") shall be eligible to participate in
EWBC's or EWB's employee benefit plans in which the similarly situated
employees of EWBC or EWB participate, to the same extent as such similarly
situated employees of EWBC or EWB participate.

 

 

(c) With respect to each employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement maintained by EWBC or EWB for the benefit of current employees of
EWBC or EWB (each such plan, program, policy or arrangement, an "EWB Plan"),
EWBC and EWB agrees that for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting (but not for benefit accrual purposes), service with
UNB shall be treated as service with EWBC or with EWB; provided, however,
that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits. To the extent permitted by any
insurer of an EWB Plan, EWB shall cause such EWB Plan to waive (i) any pre-
existing condition restriction that did not apply under the terms of any
analogous Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any
waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would
otherwise be applicable to a Former UNB Employee on or after the Effective
Time to the extent such Former UNB Employee had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under an analogous Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time and shall cause such EWB Plan to give each Former UNB Employee
credit for amounts paid under any analogous Benefit Plan for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though
such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
EWB Plan.

 

 

SECTION 6.12 _Future Employment_.

 

 

(a) EWB shall have the right but not the obligation to offer employment
immediately following the Effective Time to any and all persons who are
expected to be officers and employees of UNB immediately before the Effective
Time. UNB will provide EWBC and EWB with information regarding such persons'
current employment arrangements with UNB and will otherwise assist EWBC and
EWB in making such offers.

 

 

(b) UNB shall establish an employee severance plan (the "New Plan") that
is acceptable to EWB for UNB employees whose positions are eliminated
and who do not accept other mutually agreeable employment with EWB. The New
Plan shall replace and be in lieu of any existing employee severance policies
of UNB. All severance payments under the New Plan shall provide for the
execution of a severance agreement satisfactory to EWB as a condition to
receipt of payments, which shall provide for (i) release of claims, (ii)
confidentiality of information, and (iii) no solicitation of EWB customers or
employees for a period of one year after the Effective Time.

 

 

SECTION 6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of UNB and
EWBC shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance
known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together
with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any
Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein.

 

 

SECTION 6.14 _Human Resources Issues_. UNB agrees to cooperate with
EWB with respect to any formal meetings or interviews with one or more
employees called or arranged by UNB and held for the purpose of discussing
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or their effect on such
employees, with EWB given the opportunity to participate in such meetings or
interviews. This section is not intended to apply to casual conversations
about the transaction or informal meetings initiated by employees, or to
prohibit discussion in general, but rather to allow EWB a role in the formal
presentation of the transaction to employees, and an opportunity to
participate in the significant, formal meetings at which the transaction is
explained and discussed.

 

 

SECTION 6.15 _Assistance with Third-Party Agreements_.

 

 

(a) UNB shall cooperate with and use all commercially reasonable efforts to
assist EWB in (i) gaining access to and obtaining any required consents from
all of its third-party vendors, landlords of all of their leased properties
and other parties to material agreements, promptly after the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) obtaining the cooperation of such third parties in a
smooth transition in accordance with EWB's timetable at or after the
Effective Time. UNB shall cooperate with EWB in minimizing the extent to
which any contracts will continue in effect following the Effective Time, in
addition to complying with the prohibition of Section 4.01(l) hereof.

 

 

(b) Without limiting Section 6.15(a), UNB shall use all reasonable efforts
to provide data processing and other processing support to assist EWB in
performing all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful conversion
of UNB data and other files and records to EWB's production environment at

UNB shall:

 

 

(i) cooperate with EWB to establish a mutually agreeable project plan to

contractors continue to support both the conversion effort and its needs
until the conversion can be established;

outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts requested by EWB for
use in planning the conversion, as soon as reasonably practicable;

 

 

(iv) provide reasonable access to personnel at corporate headquarters, data
and other processing centers, all branches and, with the consent of outside
contractors, at outside contractors, to enable the conversion effort to be
completed on schedule; and

 

 

(v) to the extent reasonably practicable, give notice of termination,
conditioned upon the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, of
the contracts of outside data and other processing contractors or other
third-party vendors when directed to do so by EWB.

 

 

(vi) EWB agrees that all actions taken pursuant to this Section 6.15 shall
be taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption to the customary
business activities of UNB.

 

 

SECTION 6.16 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after
the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement or to vest EWBC or EWB with full title to
all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of UNB,
the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take
all necessary or appropriate action.

 

 

SECTION 6.17 _Pre-Closing Adjustments_. At or before the Effective Time,
as determined by UNB and EWBC, UNB shall make such accounting entries
or adjustments, including additions to its ALL and charge-offs of loans as
EWBC shall direct as a result of its on-going review of UNB (including its
review of the information provided to it pursuant to Sections 6.04 and 6.14)
or in order to implement its plans following the Effective Time or to reflect
expenses and costs related to the Merger; provided, however, that unless the
adjustment would otherwise be required by applicable law, rule or regulation,
or by regulatory accounting principles and GAAP applied on a basis consistent
with the financial statements of UNB, (a) UNB shall not be required to take
such actions more than one day prior to the Effective Time or prior to the
time EWBC agrees in writing that all of the conditions to its obligation to
close as set forth in Section 7.03 have been satisfied or waived and each of
the approvals in Section 7.01(b) have been received, and (b) no such
adjustment shall (i) require any filing with any Governmental Authority, (ii)
violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to EWBC, (iii) otherwise
materially disadvantage UNB if the Merger was not consummated or (iv)
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy
any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of this
Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach,
violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. 

 

 

SECTION 6.18 _Tax Treatment of the Merger_. The parties intend
the Agreement to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for all U.S. federal
income tax purposes. Each party will (and EWBC will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) both before and after the Effective Time (i) use reasonable
efforts to cause the Agreement to so qualify; and (ii) refrain from taking
any action that would reasonably be expected to cause the Agreement to fail
to so qualify. 

 

 

SECTION 6.19 _Limit on Stock Offerings_. EWBC shall not issue shares
of EWBC Common Stock for a period of ninety (90) days following the Effective
Time, except (i) as may be required by regulatory authorities or as may be
anticipated to be needed to meet regulatory capital adequacy guidelines to be
considered "well capitalized" or EWBC\'s internal minimum capital guidelines,
(ii) upon exercise of stock options or warrants, outstanding prior to the
Effective Time, to purchase EWBC Common Stock, or (iii) in the case of
employees and directors, the issuance of stock or the issuance of stock upon
exercise of stock options, consistent with past practices.

the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, shall have been
obtained and shall remain in full force and effect and all statutory waiting

contain any conditions, restrictions or requirements which the board of
directors of EWBC reasonably determines in good faith would (i) following the

hereby to such a degree that EWBC would not have entered into this Agreement
had such conditions, restrictions or requirements been known at the date
hereof.

 

 

(c) _No Injunction; No Litigation_. No Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
entered any statute, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, injunction or other

(d) _Tax Opinion_. UNB and EWBC shall have received the opinion of Manatt,

reasonably satisfactory to UNB and EWBC, to the effect that, on the basis of
facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion, which are
assumed in the opinion to be consistent with the state of facts existing at
the Effective Time, the Merger more likely than not will be treated for
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code. In rendering its opinion, Manatt, Phelps and Phillips, LLP, may require
and rely upon representations contained in letters from EWBC, EWB, UNB or the
Principal Shareholder and/or their officers or principal shareholders as are

similar qualifications set forth in such representations and warranties, will
have or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on

respects, each of its covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
and EWBC shall have received a certificate, dated the Effective Date, signed

delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying such fraction by $________. No holder will be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights as a shareholder in respect of
any fractional share of EWBC Common Stock. 

 

 (c) _Dissenters ' Shares_. Any shares of UNB Common Stock that are
Dissenters' Shares shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive EWBC Common Stock or cash hereunder unless and until such shares have

such shares shall be converted into cash or EWBC Common Stock.

 

 (d) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Any shares of UNB Common Stock held
by EWBC (or any of its Subsidiaries) or by UNB, other than those held in a
fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted, shall be
canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no per share cash
consideration or per share stock consideration shall be paid or issued in
exchange therefore.

 

 (e) _Effect on EWB Common Stock_. Each share of EWB Common Stock, issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an
issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Bank, and shall
not be affected by the Merger.
