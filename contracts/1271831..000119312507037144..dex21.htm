 AGREEMENT OF MERGER

This Agreement of Merger, dated as of February 15, 2007 (this "Agreement"), is
among Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Parent"), Rock Acquisition Corp., a Maryland corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Fieldstone
Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"). Capitalized
terms used but not defined elsewhere herein have the meanings assigned to them
in Section 8.15.

The Board of Managers of Parent and the respective Boards of Directors of
Merger Sub and the Company desire to enter into a transaction whereby Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), pursuant to which
each issued and outstanding share of the Companys common stock, par value
$0.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), not owned directly or indirectly by
the Company will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

In furtherance thereof, the Board of Managers of Parent and the respective
Boards of Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have determined
that entering into this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the Merger, are advisable.
The Board of Directors of the Company has recommended that its stockholders
approve this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including, without limitation, the Merger.

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter
into this Agreement, Parent and the Companys directors each are entering into
a Voting Agreement (the "Voting Agreement") with respect to the voting of
Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_.

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with, and to prescribe certain
conditions to, the Merger.

In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be
legally bound, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Maryland General
Corporation Law (the "MGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time and the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by
the Laws of the State of Maryland, and the separate corporate existence of the
Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,
shall continue unaffected by the Merger except as otherwise provided herein.

Section 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall occur
as promptly as practicable after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article 6, and in any event no later than 10:00 a.m., local
time, on the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article 6, other than conditions which by their nature
are to be satisfied at Closing (but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
such conditions), or such other time and date as Parent and the Company shall
agree in writing, unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated
pursuant to its terms (the actual time and date of the Closing is referred to
as the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Hunton and
Williams LLP, 951 East Byrd Street, Riverfront PlazaEast Tower, Richmond, VA
23219 or such other place as Parent and the Company shall agree in writing.

 

Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the parties hereto shall (a)
file articles of merger in the form required by the MGCL (the "Articles of
Merger") with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of
Maryland (the "SDAT"), and (b) duly make all other filings and recordings
required by the MGCL and other laws in order to effectuate the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at the time when the Articles of    Merger have been duly filed with, and accepted for record by, the SDAT or at
such later time as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company in writing
and specified in the Articles of Merger (the date and time that the Merger
becomes effective is referred to as the "Effective Time").

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and Section 3-114 of the MGCL.

Section 1.5. _Charter_. At the Effective Time, the charter of the Company
shall be amended to be identical to the charter of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall be the charter of the
Surviving Corporation (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall
be "Fieldstone Investment Corporation"), until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law.

Section 1.6. _Bylaws_. As of the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company
shall be amended to be identical to Merger Subs bylaws, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
Law.

Section 1.7. _Officers and Directors_. The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The
Company will take all necessary corporate action to cause the directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

Section 1.8. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, pursuant to
this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital
stock of Merger Sub:

(a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled pursuant to Section
1.8(c) below, the "Excluded Shares") shall be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to $5.53, without interest (the
"Merger Consideration"), payable to the holder thereof in accordance with
Sections 2.2 and 2.6; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Merger Consideration
shall be reduced to $5.33, without interest, in the event that the Rule 11
Comprise Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, dated as of February 14,
2007, by and among the Bass Parties, the Fieldstone Parties and KPMG LLP (each
as defined therein), is not performed in all material respects in accordance
with its terms prior to the Closing Date.

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented any shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly or indirectly by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be made or
delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which
shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.



 

2 Section 1.9. _Company Equity Awards_.

(a) All awards granting restricted shares of Company Common Stock from the
Company (collectively, "Company Restricted Shares") shall vest immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and, as of the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
1.8(a).

(b) All outstanding options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock from the
Company (collectively, "Company Stock Options") heretofore granted under any
Company Stock Plan shall become exercisable and vested immediately prior to
the Effective Time and cease to represent, as of the Effective Time, a right
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, in
settlement and cancellation thereof, into the right to receive, at the
Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment by the Surviving Corporation of an
amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the per share Merger
Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option, _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock which the holder of such Company Stock Option
could have purchased had such Company Stock Option been exercised in full by
the holder thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any dividend
equivalent payments accumulated under and payable in connection with vesting
of Company Stock Options shall automatically become fully vested, and the
accumulated dividend equivalent payments becoming so vested shall be payable
in cash in accordance with Section 1.9(d).

(c) No Person shall have any right under the Company Stock Plans or under any
other plan, program, agreement or arrangement with respect to equity interests
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or for the issuance or grant of
any right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive benefits measured by
the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock (including restricted
stock units, performance stock awards, deferred stock units and
dividend equivalents), at and after the Effective Time (except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Section 1.9 or Article 2).

(d) Subject to Section 2.7, as soon as administratively possible after the
Effective Time and not later than three Business Days after the Closing Date
(unless additional time is required to process payments under the Companys
payroll systems), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each
holder of Company Stock Options the cash payments specified in this Section
1.9. The Companys payroll processor shall be instructed to promptly pay the
holders of Company Stock Options the amounts they are entitled to receive
hereunder. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payments
contemplated by this Section 1.9.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the
Company and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, as applicable, shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.9, including (i) the vesting of
Company Restricted Shares as described in Section 1.9(a), and (ii) the
conversion of each Company Stock Option into the right to receive an amount
in cash as described in Section 1.9(b).

Section 1.10. _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time: (a) the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number of shares or different class, in each case, by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination, or
exchange of shares; (b) a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other
securities of the Company shall be declared with a record date within such
period; or (c) any similar event shall have occurred, then in each instance
referred to in the preceding clauses (a) through (c) the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock (and Company Stock Options) the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

ARTICLE 2

CONVERSION OF SHARES

Section 2.1.  _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate, and enter into an agreement with, such bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the
"Paying Agent"). Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent as of the
Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, cash sufficient to effect the payment of the Merger  



 

3  Consideration to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(a)
and this Article 2 (the "Exchange Fund").

Section 2.2. _Payment Procedures_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than three Business Days, after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time: (a) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that payment of the Merger Consideration
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such a form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify);
and (b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as Parent
may appoint, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably
require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Merger
Consideration. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Certificate is registered, then it shall be a condition to the payment of such
Merger Consideration that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall have (A) paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or (B) established to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that any such Taxes either have been paid or
are not payable.

Section 2.3. _Undistributed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the funds
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.1 that remains
undistributed to holders of Certificates on the date that is one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee, and any
holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2
shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8(a) and this Article
2. Any portion of the funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
Section 2.1 that remains unclaimed by holders of Certificates on the date that
is five years after the Effective Time or such earlier date immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.4. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective directors,
officers, employees and representatives shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Section 2.5. _Investment of Merger Consideration_. The Paying Agent shall
invest the funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.1 as
directed by Parent on a daily basis in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-2 or P-2
or better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively (or money market funds rated Aaa or better);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such gain or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to Section 1.8(a) and this
Article 2. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts remaining to be paid under Section 1.8(a) and this Article 2
shall promptly be paid to Parent.

Section 2.6. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.



 

4 Section 2.7. _Withholding Rights._ The Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or a Company Equity Award such amount that any of them is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any
provision of any other Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld (i) such amounts shall be paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, and (ii) the amounts so deducted and withheld shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Award in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, and the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall provide to the holders of such securities
written notice of the amounts so deducted or withheld.

Section 2.8. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
all deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, all other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation all right, title and interest in, to and under all of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Section 2.9. _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter
on the records of the Company. At or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason shall, subject to compliance with the provisions of
this Article 2 by the holder thereof, represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby.

Section 2.10. _Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 3-202(c)(1) of
the MGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Company Common
Stock in connection with the Merger.

ARTICLE 3

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 3.1. _Organization and Qualification_. Except as set forth in _Section
3.1_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization and has full corporate or other power and
authority to own, operate and lease the properties owned or used by it and
to carry on its business as and where such is now being conducted, except
where the failure to be so standing, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation, in each jurisdiction wherein the character of the properties
owned or leased by it, or the nature of its business, makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The copies of the charter
and bylaws of the Company, including any amendments thereto, that have been
made available by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement
are correct and complete copies of such instruments as presently in effect. 

Section 3.2. _Capitalization_.

(a) As of January 31, 2007 (the "Capitalization Date"), the authorized capital
stock of the Company consisted entirely of: (i) 90,000,000 shares of Company
Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 46,878,644 shares of
Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding (including the Company
Restricted Shares); and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, none of which were issued and outstanding. All issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of the Capitalization Date,
there were (x) Company Stock Options  



 

5  representing in the aggregate the right to acquire 857,600 shares of Company
Common Stock, (y) Company Restricted Shares relating to, in the
aggregate, 133,750 shares of Company Common Stock under the Company Stock
Plans, and (z) awards of performance shares which, by their terms, have a
performance period that extends beyond the Effective Date ("Company
Performance Shares") relating to, in the aggregate, 78,600 shares of Company
Common Stock. The Company has entered into a termination and waiver agreement
with each recipient of an award pursuant to which such Company Performance
Shares are issuable and, in accordance with the terms of such termination and
waiver agreements, each such award and the related Company Performance Shares
shall have terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and no Company
Performance Shares shall be entitled to receive any consideration in
connection with the Merger. _Section 3.2(a)_ to the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list, as of the Capitalization
Date, of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to Company
Stock Options, the number of unvested Company Restricted Shares or other
rights to purchase or receive Company Common Stock, or benefits based on the
value of Company Common Stock, granted under the Company Stock Plans, the
Employee Benefit Plans or otherwise, the dates of grant, the recipients
thereof and the exercise prices thereof. No bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which holders of capital stock of the Company may vote ("Company Voting Debt")
are issued or outstanding. There are no outstanding obligations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth above, no shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company have been issued or reserved for issuance or
are outstanding, other than the shares of Company Common Stock reserved for
issuance under the Company Stock Plans. Except as set forth in _Section
3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no options,
warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock
rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance units, commitments,
Contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound: (A)
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell,
or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock
or other equity interests in, or any security convertible or exercisable for
or exchangeable into any capital stock of or other equity interest in, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Voting Debt; (B) obligating
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into
any such option, warrant, call, right, security, unit, commitment, Contract,
arrangement or undertaking; or (C) giving any Person the right to receive any
economic benefit or right similar to or derived from the economic benefits
and rights occurring to holders of capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests of its
Subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances and
other security interests of any nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"). A
correct and complete list of all of the Companys Subsidiaries, together with
the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary and the
percentage of each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock or other equity
interests owned by the Company or another of its Subsidiaries, is set forth in
_Section 3.2(b)-1_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule. A correct and complete
list of all corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies,
associations and other entities (excluding the Companys Subsidiaries) in
which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company owns any joint venture,
partnership, strategic alliance or similar interest, together with the
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each such entity and the
percentage of each such entitys outstanding capital stock or other equity
interests owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is set forth in 
_Section 3.2(b)-2_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except for its
interest in the Subsidiaries, joint venture or similar entities as set forth
in _Section 3.2(b)-2_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does
not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock interest, equity
membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other
equity interest in any Person. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is obligated to make any contribution to the capital of, make any loan to or
guarantee the debts of any joint venture or similar entity (excluding the
Companys wholly-owned Subsidiaries).

(c) Parent has prior to the date of this Agreement received a correct and
complete copy of each Company Stock Plan.

Section 3.3. _Authorization_. The Company has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, subject, in the case of the
consummation of the Merger, to the approval and adoption of this Agreement by
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding

by the  



 

6  Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no

executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally
binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in

of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to
general equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").

no Subsidiary of the Company or Securitization Trust is required to file any
registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule, form, statement or

Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company SEC Reports, as of their
respective dates (and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Except as set
forth in _Section 3.5(a)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule, all of the
Company SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (and as of the date of any
amendment to the respective Company SEC Report), complied as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of

Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), as the case may be.

(b) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Global
Market. Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2)

Disclosure Schedule, each of the financial statements (including the related
notes and schedules thereto) of the Company included in the Company SEC
Reports, as of their respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to
the respective Company SEC Report), complied as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP")
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods and the dates involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position and consolidated
results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or for the respective periods
set forth therein, subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, to the absence of notes and normal year-end adjustments that have
not been and are not expected to be material in amount or effect.

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and except for liabilities disclosed or reserved or reflected in a
balance sheet (including the notes thereto) included in the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement and liabilities incurred on
behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have no liabilities, absolute or contingent,
other than liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice after September 30, 2006, that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(e) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer and former
principal financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all
certifications required under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 with respect to the Company SEC Reports. (For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002.) 

(f) The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of internal
control over financial reporting, to the Companys auditors and the audit
committee of the Companys Board of Directors (A) all significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. Except as set forth in _Section
3.5(f)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule, since the Applicable Date, no
material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters, and no concerns from Company employees
regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, have been received by
the Company. Except as  



 

8  set forth in _Section 3.5(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence
of a violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Companys chief legal officer, audit committee (or other
committee designated for the purpose) of the Board of Directors or the Board
of Directors pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any Company policy contemplating such
reporting, including in instances not required by those rules.

(g) The Company has designed disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer.

(h) The date of each Company Stock Option that is reflected in the Companys
books and records is the actual date of grant thereof (as determined under
GAAP). All Company Stock Options were granted with an exercise price at least
equal to the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on the date of
grant of such Company Stock Option and no Company Stock Option has been
amended to reduce the exercise price from that in effect on the date of grant
(except pursuant to non-discretionary antidilution provisions governing such
Company Stock Option). The financial statements of the Company included in
the Company SEC Reports fairly reflect in all material respects amounts
required to be shown as expense in connection with the grant and/or amendment
of any Company Stock Option.

Section 3.6. _Proxy Statement_. None of the information contained or
incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement will, on the date on which
it is first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company

to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; _provided_ that the Company makes no
representation regarding information provided in writing by Parent or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement will
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act.

exempt from, the provisions of the Maryland Business Combinations Act that
relate to the Company.

director or officer, or any similar action, except, in the case of this
subsection (c): (i) to the extent required under the terms of any agreements,
trusts, plans, funds or other arrangements disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement; (ii) to the extent required
by applicable Law; (iii) for increases (other than in equity-based
compensation) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice; or (iv) as contemplated or otherwise permitted by this Agreement.

businesses or assets or (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, pending or
threatened against any of their respective officers or directors (in

Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set forth in _Section 3.9_
to the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses or assets is subject to any

Company. The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that, for all purposes of
this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of antitrust Laws on such partys ability to
execute, deliver, or perform its obligations under the Agreement or to
consummate the Merger as a result of the enactment, promulgation,
application, or threatened or actual judicial or administrative investigation
or litigation order, or enforcement of, any antitrust Law with respect to the
consummation of the Merger.

Section 3.10. _Permits; Compliance with Laws_. Except as set forth in _Section
3.10_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries
hold all material permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions,
Orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities that are necessary for the
operation of their respective material businesses as now being conducted

any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened. Except as set forth in _Section 3.10_ to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries have not received any notices of
noncompliance with respect to, the Company Permits and any Laws, except for

have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the knowledge of the
Company, and except as set forth in _Section 3.10_ to the Company Disclosure
Schedule and except for ordinary regulatory examinations relating to the
origination, mortgage lending and servicing activities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to the

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to pay for favorable treatment for
business secured or to pay for special concessions already obtained for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in each case referred to in
clauses (a) through (f), where such acts, individually or in the aggregate,

Effect on the Company.

Section 3.11. _Tax Matters_.

Except as set forth in _Section 3.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule:



 

10 (a) The most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement reflect a reserve or accrual
determined in accordance with GAAP for liabilities or expenses for all
material Taxes due and payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries as a group
for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such
financial statements. The Company and its Subsidiaries (as a group) have
established on their books and records in accordance with GAAP (which may, but
are not required to, be reflected only on the books and records of the
Company) reserves or accrued liabilities or expenses for the payment of all
Taxes for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is liable but are not
yet due and payable.

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed (taking into account any extension of time within which
to file), and all such Tax Returns were, at the time filed, and are correct
and complete in all material respects. The Company has provided Parent with
access to complete and accurate copies of all such Tax Returns for which the
statute of limitations is still open.

(c) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has duly withheld, collected and
timely paid all material Taxes that it was required to withhold, collect and
pay relating to amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, stockholder or other Person (other than those that are being
contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings, are set forth in 
_Section 3.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and for which appropriate
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP).

(d) No unpaid Tax deficiency has been asserted against or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No Tax audit or other administrative
proceeding or court proceedings are presently pending or threatened with
regard to any material Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No
claim has been made in writing by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to Tax or required to
file a Tax Return in such jurisdiction. There are no outstanding waivers or
comparable consents that have been given by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries regarding the application of the statute of limitations with
respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns. There are no Liens on any of the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that arose in connection with any Taxes,
other than Liens for Taxes that are not yet due and payable.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested or received
a Tax ruling, private letter ruling, technical advice memorandum,
competent authority relief or similar agreement or entered into a closing
agreement or contract with any taxing authority that, in each case, remains
outstanding or effective. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to a Tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or similar agreement
(except such agreements as are solely between or among the Company and its
Subsidiaries) pursuant to which it could have an obligation to make a material
payment to any Person in respect of Taxes. The Company and its Subsidiaries
do not have any material liability for the Taxes of any Person other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries (A) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), (B) as a
transferee or successor or (C) by contract or otherwise.

(f) The Company has not been a member of an Affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated tax return except for groups for which it was the
parent corporation. None of the Companys Subsidiaries has ever been a member
of an Affiliated group of corporations that filed a consolidated tax return
except for groups of which the Company was the parent corporation.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is participating or has
participated in a reportable or listed transaction within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations section 1.6011-4 or section 6707A(c) of the Code. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries have disclosed on their federal income
Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could reasonably be expected to
give rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the
meaning of section 6662 of the Code.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been the "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of section 355
of the Code) with respect to a transaction described in section 355 of the
Code.



 

11 (i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include in
income any amount from an adjustment pursuant to section 481 of the Code and
the regulations thereunder or any similar provision of Law.

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have made any payments,
are obligated to make any payments, or are parties to an agreement that would
reasonably be expected to obligate them to make any payments that will not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

(k) For each year, beginning with the short taxable year ended December 31,
2003 (the "Initial REIT Year") and through the taxable year ended December
31, 2006, the Company has been subject to taxation as a real estate investment
trust (a "REIT") within the meaning of section 856 of the Code and has
satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years. From January
1, 2007, through the date hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
operated in such a manner as to permit the Company to continue to qualify as
and be taxed as a REIT, and the Company and such Subsidiaries intend to
continue to operate in such a manner through the Effective Time.

(l) Each Subsidiary of the Company that files Tax Returns as a partnership or
is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes has been properly
classified as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not
as an association taxable as a corporation or a "publicly traded partnership"
within the meaning of section 7704(b) of the Code. Each Subsidiary of the
Company that is a corporation has been, in and after the Initial REIT Year,
properly classified as a qualified REIT subsidiary under section 856(i)
of the Code or as a taxable REIT subsidiary under section 856(l) of the Code.

(m) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of
which would reasonably be expected to be subject to rules similar to section
1374 of the Code.

(n) With respect to each Subsidiary that is intended to be a "taxable
mortgage pool" within the meaning of Section 7701(i) of the Code, (i) such
entity has at all times since its formation qualified as a "taxable mortgage
pool" within the meaning of section 7701(i) of the Code, (ii) no election
under section 860D(b) has been made with respect to such Subsidiary, and (iii)
such Subsidiary has at all times qualified as a "qualified REIT subsidiary,"
within the meaning of section 856(i) of the Code, of the Company.

(o) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company does not have any earnings
and profits accumulated in any "non-REIT year" (within the meaning of section
857 of the Code) by the Company or any other corporation.

(p) The Company has incurred no material liability for any Taxes, which have
not previously been paid, under section 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code or
Treasury Regulation section 1.337(d)-7, including, without limitation, any
Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in section 857(b)(6) of
the Code and the excise tax on redetermined rents, redetermined deductions,
and excess interest under section 857(b)(7) of the Code; and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for
Taxes that have not been previously paid other than in the ordinary course of
business and other than transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with
the sale of property.

Section 3.12. _Environmental Matters_.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable Laws and Orders relating to pollution, protection of the
environment or human health, occupational safety and health or sanitation,
including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, as amended, and all other applicable Laws and Orders relating
to emissions, spills, discharges, generation, storage, leaks, injection,
leaching, seepage, releases or threatened releases of Hazardous Substances
into the environment (including ambient air, surface water, ground water, land
surface or subsurface strata) or otherwise relating to the manufacture,
processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or
handling of Hazardous Substances, together with any plan, notice or demand
letter issued, entered, promulgated or approved thereunder (collectively,
"Environmental Laws"), except for instances of noncompliance where neither
the costs to comply nor the failure to comply, individually or in the
aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a  



 

12  Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of (i) any material violation
of an Environmental Law or (ii) the institution of any claim, action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry by any Governmental Entity or other
Person alleging that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be in material
violation of or materially liable under any Environmental Law.

(b) Except as has not had and would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, there are no liabilities
of or relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, arising under or
relating to any Environmental Law or any Hazardous Substance.

Section 3.13. _Intellectual Property_.

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have good title to or, with respect to
items not owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries, sufficient rights to
use all Intellectual Property Rights that are owned or licensed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or utilized by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the conduct of their respective businesses (all of the
foregoing items are hereinafter referred to as the "Company Intellectual
Property"). _Section 3.13_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an
accurate list, as of the date of this Agreement, of (i) all material Company
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
(ii) all agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
and pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries obtains the right
to use any material Company Intellectual Property. To conduct the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries requires any material Intellectual Property Rights
that the Company and its Subsidiaries do not already own or license. The
Company has no knowledge of any infringement or misappropriation by others of
Intellectual Property Rights owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
The conduct of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries does not
infringe on or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Rights of others,
except where such infringement or misappropriation, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(b) No claims with respect to Company Intellectual Property are pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened by any Person (i) to the effect that
the manufacture, sale or use of any product, process or service as now used or
offered or proposed for use or sale by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
infringes on any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person, (ii) against the
use by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Company Intellectual
Property or (iii) challenging the ownership, validity, enforceability or
effectiveness of any Company Intellectual Property, except where such claims,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(c) The Company has taken reasonable measures in accordance with normal
industry practice to protect the confidentiality of all Trade Secrets that are
owned, used or held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no such Trade Secret material to the business or
operation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been used, disclosed
or otherwise misappropriated by any person except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(d) The Company has not granted any licenses to use, or any covenants not to
sue under, any of its material Company Intellectual Property to any third
party, other than those non-exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course
of business described in _Section 3.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(e) The material IT Assets owned by the Company operate and perform in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for the performance of their businesses. To the knowledge
of the Company, no person has gained unauthorized access to the IT Assets,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. The Company has used commercially reasonable efforts to
implement reasonable backup and disaster recovery plans consistent with the
Companys business needs.

(f) The Company has implemented such commercially reasonable systems
safeguards, information as well as retention and disposal and other policies
and procedures as are necessary in order to comply with the
information safeguard requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, to
the extent applicable to the  



 

13  Company, and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto,
including the rules relating to the safeguarding of information.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the following
meanings:

"Intellectual Property Rights" means all (i) trademarks, service marks, brand
names, certification marks, collective marks, d/b/as, Internet domain names,
logos, symbols, trade dress, trade names, and other indicia of origin, all
applications and registrations for the foregoing, and all goodwill associated

of authorship, whether copyrightable or not (including without limitation
databases and other compilations of information), copyrights therein and
thereto, and registrations and applications therefor, and all renewals,
extensions, restorations and reversions thereof; and (v) all other similar
intellectual property or proprietary rights.

"IT Assets" means computers, computer software, firmware, middleware,
servers, workstations, routers, hubs, switches, data communications lines, and
all other information technology equipment, and all associated documentation.

Section 3.14. _Employee Benefits_.

(a) _Section 3.14(a)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct
and complete list of all "employee benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(3)
of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), and all other material employee benefit or executive compensation
Contracts, arrangements, perquisite programs or payroll practices that are
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to contribute, for current or former
employees or directors (or dependents or beneficiaries thereof) of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Employee Benefit Plans").

(b) No Employee Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan. During the last five
years, none of the Company, its current or former Subsidiaries or any current
or former ERISA Affiliate has (i) withdrawn from any Multiemployer Plan in a
complete or partial withdrawal under circumstances in which any withdrawal
liability was not satisfied in full or (ii) engaged in a transaction that is
subject to Section 4069 of ERISA. During the last five years, none of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries is or has ever been a party to any multiple
employer plan, as that term is defined in Section 413(c) of the Code or a
multiple employer welfare arrangement as that term is defined in Section 3(40)
of ERISA.

(c) No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. None of the Employee Benefit Plans or any
other plan, fund or program ever maintained or contributed to by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate during the past six years that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA has been terminated so as to subject, directly
or indirectly, any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
liability, contingent or otherwise, or the imposition of any Lien under Title
IV of ERISA.

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have reserved the right to amend,
terminate or modify at any time all Employee Benefit Plans, except as limited
by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement or contract with an
individual or to the extent applicable Law would prohibit the Company or any
Subsidiary from so reserving or exercising such right.

(e) Either the Internal Revenue Service has issued a currently effective
favorable determination letter with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan
that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401 of
the Code, and each trust maintained pursuant thereto has been determined to be
exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code by the IRS
or each such "qualified plan" is entitled to rely on an opinion letter issued
by the Internal Revenue Service. Each such Employee Benefit Plan has been
timely  



 

14  amended since the date of the latest favorable determination letter in
accordance with all applicable Laws. Nothing has occurred with respect to
the operation of any such Employee Benefit Plan that is reasonably likely to
cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any
material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code.

(f) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the officers or directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could
subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any material tax or penalty on
prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975 or to any liability under
Section 502 of ERISA.

(g) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, there are no claims (except claims for benefits payable in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and proceedings with
respect to qualified domestic relations orders), suits or proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or involving any
Employee Benefit Plan, asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any
Employee Benefit Plan or asserting any claims against any administrator,
fiduciary or sponsor thereof. Except as, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened investigations by any Governmental Entity involving
any Employee Benefit Plans.

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 3.14(h)_ to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, all Employee Benefit Plans have been established, maintained and
administered in accordance with their terms and with all provisions of
applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, except for instances of
noncompliance where neither the costs to comply nor the failure to comply,
individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. All contributions or premiums
required to be made with respect to an Employee Benefit Plan, whether by law
or pursuant to the terms of the plan or any contract that funds the benefits
due thereunder, have been made when due. With respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan the liabilities of which have been disclosed on the Companys financial
statements as included in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, no event has occurred since the date of such disclosure that
has resulted in a material increase in such liabilities.

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 3.14(i)_ to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) will: (i) increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Employee Benefit Plan; (ii) result in any acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits; (iii) limit or prohibit
the ability to amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan; (iv) require the
funding of any trust or other funding vehicle; or (v) renew or extend the term
of any agreement in respect of compensation for an employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that would create any liability to the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Affiliates after consummation of the Merger.

(j) Except as set forth in _Section 3.14(j)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to a
Contract (including this Agreement) that under any circumstances could
obligate it to make payments (either before or after the Closing Date) that
will not be deductible because of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code.
_Section 3.14(j)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each Employee
Benefit Plan that provides for a payment upon a change in control and/or any
subsequent employment termination (including any agreement that provides for
the cash-out or acceleration of options or restricted stock and any "gross-up"
payments with respect to any of the foregoing), but excluding severance plans
that are generally applicable to employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

(k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided written
communications to any group of its current or former employees or any of its
directors of any intention or commitment to establish or implement any
additional material Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit
arrangement or to amend or modify, in any material respect, any existing
Employee Benefit Plan.



 

15 (l) No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to the Law of any jurisdiction other
than the United States. 

Section 3.15. _Employee Matters_.

attempts relating to labor unions, labor organizations or works councils
occurring with respect to any employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(c) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company: (i)

threatened before the National Labor Relations Board or any other Governmental
Entity; (ii) there are no labor strikes, slowdowns, stoppages, walkouts,
lockouts or disputes pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) there are

arising out of or under any labor agreement, collective bargaining agreement,

employment opportunity, age and disability discrimination, immigration
control, employee classification, information privacy and security, payment
and withholding of taxes and continuation coverage with respect to group
health plans. Since December 31, 2003, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has effectuated (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN Act")) affecting any site
of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of
employment or facility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) a "mass
layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act); or (iii) such other transaction,

Statement"). Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the Company and

preparation of the Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide to the Company
any information regarding Parent or Merger Sub that is necessary to include in
the Proxy Statement. The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement

the Exchange Act. Subject to Parents and Merger Subs compliance with this
Section 5.2(a) and Section 5.4, the Company shall use its commercially

to its stockholders as promptly as practicable after its filing with the SEC.
The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide
Parent with copies of all written comments, and advise Parent of all oral
comments, with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. If, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to the Company,
or any of its Subsidiaries, officers or directors, should be discovered by
Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, then the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by
Law, the Company shall promptly file with the SEC and disseminate to its
stockholders an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall (i) provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and (ii) include in such document or response all reasonable
comments of a substantive nature that Parent proposes. On the date of their

written notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders on a date
reasonably acceptable to Parent (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Requisite Stockholder Vote with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take all lawful action to
solicit the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Company Requisite
Stockholder Vote. The Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend
approval and adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company to
the effect set forth in Section 3.7 (the "Company Recommendation"), and the
Board of Directors of the Company shall not withdraw, modify or qualify (or
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify or publicly announce that it is
considering withdrawing, modifying or qualifying) in any manner adverse to
Parent such recommendation or take any action or make any statement in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such
recommendation, including a recommendation by the Companys Board of Directors
of an Acquisition Proposal (collectively, a "Change in Company
Recommendation"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors of the
Company may make a Change in the Company Recommendation in accordance with,
and subject to the limitations set forth in, Section 5.5.

Section 5.3. _Access and Information_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable notice, afford Parent and its
counsel, accountants, consultants and other authorized representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the employees, properties,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_
, that such investigation shall not affect the representations and warranties
made by the Company in this Agreement, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not require the Company to permit any inspection or disclose
any information that in the reasonable judgment of the Company, after
providing notice to Parent, would result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties in violation of the terms of any agreements between
the Company or its Subsidiaries and such third parties. Without limitation of
the foregoing, the Company shall cause its officers and employees to (x)
furnish such financial and operating data and other information as may be
reasonably requested by Parent from time to time and (y) respond to such
reasonable inquiries as may be made by Parent from time to time. Prior to
their filing, the Company shall furnish as promptly  



 

30  as practicable to Parent a copy of each registration statement, prospectus,
report, form and other document (if any) that will be filed by it or any of
its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws, The NASDAQ Global Market or
the MGCL. All of the requirements of this Section 5.3 shall be subject to (i)
any prohibitions or limitations of applicable Law, (ii) the terms of any
Contract entered into prior to the date hereof to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to the extent disclosure thereof to Parent would
reasonably be expected to violate the terms of such Contract (it being agreed
that the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause such information
to be provided in a manner that does not cause such violation or prohibition),
(iii) any restrictions which the Company reasonably believes are necessary to
preserve the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (iv) the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly (i) provide Parent
with copies of all monthly and other interim financial statements as the same
become available and (ii) notify Parent of any changes in the tax basis of
the Companys stock in Fieldstone Mortgage Company. The Company shall provide
Parent with prompt written notice of any material change in the business or
affairs of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including notice of any
requests for repurchase or indemnity under any Investor Agreements, Servicing
Agreements or subservicing agreements, and of any complaints, investigations
or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated)
by Governmental Entities, or the institution or, to its knowledge, the threat
of material litigation (including all litigation relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby), and the Company shall keep Parent informed of such
events. Parent shall provide the Company with prompt written notice of the
institution or, to its knowledge, the threat of litigation relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.4. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Parent and the Company
anticipate that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are exempt
from the filing requirements of the HSR Act. In the event the parties
determine that such exemption does not apply to the transactions contemplated
herein, appropriate HSR Act filings shall be made in accordance with this
Section 5.4. Other than as it relates to any HSR Act filings, the foregoing
shall not limit the obligations of either the Company or the Parent under
this Section 5.4.

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate with and assist the other
party, and shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to) use all of
their commercially reasonable efforts, to promptly (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents, and (ii) obtain and maintain
all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations required to be obtained from any other Person, including any
Governmental Entity, that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby in the most expeditious
manner practicable, but in any event before the Termination Date. Except as
otherwise expressly contemplated hereby, each of the Company and Parent shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, take any action or knowingly
omit to take any action within its reasonable control where such action or
omission would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in (A) any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 6 not being satisfied prior to
the Termination Date or (B) a material delay in the satisfaction of
such conditions. Neither Parent nor the Company will directly or indirectly
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or other Regulatory Laws or enter
into any agreement with a Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the prior written
consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld in
light of closing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or before
the Termination Date.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
shall (i) make any required filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act, apply for early termination thereunder and make appropriate
filings under all other applicable Regulatory Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement (but in no event shall such Notification and Report Form be
filed more than 10 days after the date that the parties determine that a
filing under the HSR Act is required with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act and any other applicable Regulatory Laws and (iii) take all
other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other applicable
Regulatory Laws as soon as practicable.



 

31 (c) In connection with this Section 5.4, the parties hereto shall (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing,
submission, investigation or inquiry, (ii) promptly inform the other party of
any communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Entity and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, in each case, regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each shall consult the other on, any filing made with, or written
materials to be submitted to, the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental
Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, any other
Person, in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(iv) consult with each other in advance of any meeting, discussion, telephone
call or conference with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person,
and to the extent not expressly prohibited by the DOJ, the FTC or any
other Governmental Entity or Person, give the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences, in each case,
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereto may,
as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.4 as "Outside
Counsel Only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4,
materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing
in this Agreement will require or obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to
(and in no event shall any representation, warranty or covenant of
Parent contained in this Agreement be breached or deemed breached as a result
of the failure of Parent to take any of the following actions) (i) agree to or
otherwise become subject to any limitations on (A) the right of Parent
effectively to control or operate its business (including the business of the
Company) or assets (including the assets of the Company), (B) the right of
Parent to consummate the Merger, or (C) the right of Parent to exercise full
rights of ownership of its business (including the business of the Company)
or assets (including the assets of the Company), (ii) agree or be required to
sell or otherwise dispose of, hold (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise), or divest itself of all or any portion of the business, assets or
operations of Parent or any of its Affiliates or the business of the Company
or any of the assets of the Company, or (iii) otherwise take any steps to
avoid or eliminate any impediment that may be asserted under any Law
governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices.

Section 5.5. _Acquisition Proposals_. 

(a) Until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1
(and the payments, if any, required to be made in connection with such
termination pursuant to Section 7.2(b) have been made) and subject to
applicable public disclosure requirements of (i) The NASDAQ Global Market and
(ii) applicable securities Laws, the Company shall not, and shall not
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and its
Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees, consultants, representatives and
other agents, including investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors (collectively, the "Representatives"), not to, directly or
indirectly, (1) solicit or initiate the making of, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (including,
without limitation, taking any action to make the provisions of any
"moratorium", "control share acquisition", "fair price",
"affiliate transaction", "business combination" or other antitakeover laws
and regulations of any state, including, without limitation, the provisions of
subtitle 7 of Title 3 of the MGCL inapplicable to any transactions
contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal), (2) participate in any way in
discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any non-public

response to an unsolicited, _bonafide_ and written Acquisition Proposal that

the Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has solicited
such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise violated any of the provisions of this

recognized financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (C) a majority of the

information to, such Person, the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms no less restrictive upon such

of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Representatives of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has violated any of the provisions of
this Section 5.5, (B) the Company provides Parent with written notice
indicating that the Board of Directors of the Company, acting in good faith,
believes that the Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal, (C) during the three Business Day period after the Company
provides Parent with the written notice described in clause (B) above, the

faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) in an effort to

the Acquisition Proposal would not constitute a Superior Proposal, (D)
notwithstanding the negotiations and adjustments pursuant to clause (C) above
but after taking into account the results of such negotiations and
adjustments, the Board of Directors of the Company makes the determination
necessary for such Acquisition Proposal to constitute a Superior Proposal at
least three Business Days after the Company provides Parent with the written
notice referred to in clause (B) above, (E) notwithstanding the negotiations
and adjustments pursuant to clause (C) above but after taking into account
the results of such negotiations and adjustments, at least three Business Days
after the Company provides Parent with the written notice referred to in

any right that it may have to contest the amount so payable.

(b) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section
5.5(a), within one Business Day of the receipt thereof, the Company shall
provide Parent with written notice of (i) any request for information, any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal, discussions or negotiations
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the material terms and
conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal,

status and general progress (including amendments or proposed amendments to
any material terms) of any such request or Acquisition Proposal and keep
Parent informed as to the material details of any information requested of
or provided by the Company and as to the material details of all discussions
or negotiations. Without limiting the Companys obligations under Section
5.5(a), the Company shall provide Parent with notice at least one Business Day
prior to (or such lesser notice, which may be none, as is provided to the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company) any meeting of the Board of
Directors of the Company at which the Board of Directors is reasonably
expected to discuss or consider any Acquisition Proposal.

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease all
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Person other than Parent and its

of its Subsidiaries) to return or destroy all nonpublic information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 shall prohibit the Company
from complying with Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such Rules shall
in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

(e) Any violation of this Section 5.5 by the Companys Subsidiaries or the
Representatives of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by the Company, whether or not such Subsidiaries or
Representative is authorized to act and whether or not such Subsidiaries or
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company.

Section 5.6. _Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance_.

(a) Parent shall cause all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including, but not limited to, any acts or omissions in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby)
now existing in favor of any current and former officers, directors and
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any Person prior to
the Effective Time serving at the request of any such party as a director,
officer, employee fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership,
trust or other enterprise, as provided in the respective certificates or
articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents)
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Persons"), to
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms for a period of six years after the Effective Time. Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an
aggregate period of not less than six years from the Effective Time,
the Indemnified Persons an insurance policy that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, but not limited to,
any acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby) (the "DandO Insurance") on the same
terms as the Companys existing policy or, if such insurance coverage is
unavailable, coverage that is on terms no less favorable to such directors and
officers;  _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance
in excess of 250% of the last annual premium that the Company paid prior to
the date of this Agreement, and if the annual premium of such insurance
coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy
with respect to the applicable insurance coverage with the greatest coverage
 



 

34  available for a cost not exceeding such amount. In lieu of Parent causing
the Surviving Corporation to maintain the policies as described above, Parent
may elect to cause the Company to purchase immediately prior to the Effective
Time a six-year "tail" pre-paid policy on terms and conditions not materially
less favorable than the current directors and officers liability
insurance policies (but not, in any event, to exceed in cost the present
value of the aggregate amount required to be paid for the DandO Insurance
pursuant to the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence), such policy to
be effective as of the Effective Time.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to possess sufficient assets
in order for the Surviving Corporation to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 5.6, _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the Surviving
Corporation is unable to fulfill its obligations hereunder, Parent shall
assume such obligations. The provisions of this Section 5.6 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger for a period of six years and are expressly
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and representatives; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any claim or claims for
indemnification set forth in this Section 5.6 are asserted or made within such
six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or
claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims. If Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or assets
to any other Person, then, in each such case, (A) to the extent necessary, a
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section
5.6 and (B) prompt notice thereof shall be provided to the Indemnified
Persons.

Section 5.7. _Public Announcements_.

(a) Neither Parent nor the Company shall issue any press release or otherwise
make any public statement with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written consent of the other, unless Parent or the Company
(as the case may be) determines that the issuance of such press release or
the making of such other public statement is required by applicable Law or by
the requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market or any national securities
exchange on which the Company Common Stock is then listed.

(b) Parent and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
establish a mutually acceptable process intended to ensure that before any
Merger Communication of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
"participants" (as defined in Item 4 of Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act) is
(i) disseminated to any investor, analyst, member of the media, employee,
client, customer or other third party or otherwise made accessible on the
website of Parent, the Company or any such participant, as applicable (whether
in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), or (ii)
utilized by any officer, senior manager, key employee or advisor of Parent,
the Company or any such participant, as applicable, as a script in discussions
or meetings with any such third parties, the other party and its counsel have
a reasonable opportunity to review any such Merger Communication for purposes
of, among other things, determining whether that communication constitutes
"soliciting material" that is required to be filed by Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule
14a-12(b) of the Exchange Act, as applicable. As part of any such process,
Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, shall (or shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such participant to) give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the other
such party or parties and their counsel on any such Merger Communication. For
purposes of the foregoing, the term "Merger Communication" shall mean, with
respect to any Person, any document or other written communication prepared
by or on behalf of that Person, or any document or other material or
information posted or made accessible on the website of that Person (whether
in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), that is
related to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, if
reviewed by a holder of the Company Common Stock, would reasonably be deemed
to constitute a "solicitation" of "proxies" (in each case, as defined in Rule
14a-1 of the Exchange Act) in favor of the Merger.

Section 5.8.  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions that are required to cause any dispositions of Company
Common Stock (and derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article 1 by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act. 



 

35 Section 5.9. _State Takeover Laws_. If any "moratorium", "control
share acquisition", "fair price", "affiliate transaction", "business
combination" or similar Law shall become applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, then the Company and the Board of Directors of the
Company shall use their respective best efforts to grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or
similar Law on the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.10. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt written notice to the Company,
and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt
written notice to Parent, of: (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any
event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which such party is aware and that
would be reasonably likely to cause: (i) any representation or warranty made
by such party in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect (or any representation or warranty made by such party in this
Agreement that is qualified by materiality or refers to material adverse
effect to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect); or (ii) any covenant
or agreement made by such party in this Agreement not to be complied with or
satisfied in all material respects; or (b) any change or event affecting such
party that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
such party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available under this Agreement to the party receiving such notice; and
_provided_   _further_ that no party shall have the right not to close the
Merger or the right to terminate this Agreement as a result of the delivery
of, or failure to deliver, such a notice by another party hereto if the
underlying breach would not result in such party having such rights under the
terms of Articles 6 and 7 hereof.

Section 5.11. _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
against the Company or its officers or directors relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall not agree to any compromise
or settlement of such litigation without Parents consent, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld.

Section 5.12.  _Confidentiality_. Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges
and confirms that (a) the Company and Parent have entered into a
Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 14, 2006 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), (b) all information provided by each party hereto to the other
party hereto pursuant to this Agreement is subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and (c) the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and conditions.

cause each member of the Board of Directors of the Company to execute and
deliver a letter, which shall not be revoked or amended prior to the Effective
Time, effectuating his or her resignation as a director of the Company
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall obtain the resignations of such directors of its
Subsidiaries as Parent shall request with reasonable advance notice.

Section 5.14. _Employee Matters_.

similarly situated employees employed by Parent or its Affiliates in the
medical benefit plans and 401(k) plans sponsored or maintained by Parent or
its Affiliates, as applicable (the "Parent Plans").

(b) For purposes of vesting and eligibility (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual) under each Parent Plan in which Continuing Employees become eligible
to participate after the Closing Date, such participating Continuing Employee
will be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors) to the same extent as such

service under any similar plan, except to the extent such credit would result
in a duplication of benefits or is prohibited under applicable Law.

Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date, and (2) provide each Continuing Employee
who participates in such Parent Welfare Plans with credit for any co-payments

Section 8.4. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Voting Agreement and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all prior understandings, agreements or representations, by or among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.

Section 8.5. _Assignment; Binding Effect_. No party hereto may assign this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written approval of the
other parties hereto, and any attempted assignment without such prior written

that Merger Sub may assign its rights hereunder to a direct or indirect

Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.

Section 8.6. _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific
Performance; Jurisdiction_.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF MARYLAND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.



 

43 (c) The parties agree that money damages or any other remedy at law would not
be a sufficient or adequate remedy for any breach or violation of, or default
under, this Agreement by them and that, in addition to all other available
remedies, each party shall be entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, to an injunction restraining such actual or threatened breach, violation
or default and to any other equitable relief, including specific performance,
without bond or other security being required.

(d) The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be brought in any federal court located in the State of Maryland or in the
Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The
parties hereto further agree that, in the event that any suit, action or
proceeding is brought in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, the parties
shall jointly request that the case be assigned to that courts business and

Section 8.7. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, then all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 8.8. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the rights of the
Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration and except for

or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further agree that the
rights of third party beneficiaries shall not arise unless and until the
Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
Section 8.3 without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons (other than the parties hereto) may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.
