                                   ARTICLE I

                                  THE MERGER
                                  ----------

               SECTION 1.01   The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the
                              ----------
conditions set forth in Article VII, and in accordance with the URBCA, at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02), Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"), provided however, that
                                ---------------------
in the event that the provisions of this Section 1.01 would preclude the Merger
from qualifying as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of section
368(a) of the Code, then the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub,
the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease, the Merger Sub
shall continue as the Surviving Corporation and the terms of this Agreement
shall be adjusted accordingly.

               SECTION 1.02   Effective Time; Closing. As promptly as

practicable following the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (or such other date as may be agreed by each
of the parties hereto), the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Utah. The term "Effective Time" means the date and time of such filing
                         --------------
(or such later time as may be agreed by each of the parties hereto and specified
in the Articles of Merger). Immediately prior to the filing of the Certificate
of Merger, a closing (the "Closing") will be held
                           -------

                                       2

at the offices of Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP,
155 Constitution Drive, Menlo Park, California 94025 (or such other place as the
parties may agree). The date on which the Closing shall occur is referred to
herein as the "Closing Date."
               ------------

               SECTION 1.03   Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
                              --------------------
effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the
URBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at
the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties
of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

               SECTION 1.04   Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.
                              ---------------------------------

               (a)  At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of
Merger Sub, attached hereto as Exhibit B, shall be the Articles of Incorporation
                               ---------
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and
such Articles of Incorporation.

               (b)  At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, attached hereto as Exhibit C,
                                                                   ---------
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and
such Bylaws.

               SECTION 1.05   Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger
                              ----------------------
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

               SECTION 2.03   Exchange of Certificates.
                              ------------------------

               (a)  Exchange Procedures. From and after the Effective Time,
                    -------------------
Boston EquiServe or another bank or trust company to be designated by Parent
shall act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in effecting the exchange of
                                  --------------
the applicable Parent Shares for certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Stock ("Company Share
                                                                 -------------
Certificates") and which were converted into the right to receive the applicable
------------
Parent Shares pursuant to Section 2.01. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall mail to each record holder
of Company Share Certificates a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of
                                                            ---------
Transmittal") in a form approved by Parent and the Company and instructions for
-----------
use in surrendering such Company Share Certificates and receiving Parent Shares
pursuant to Section 2.01 therefor. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than 20 business days following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be deposited in trust with the Exchange Agent the Parent Shares (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(e)) and the aggregate
Pro Rata Cash Distribution.

          Upon the surrender of each Company Share Certificate for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed Letter of Transmittal
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent:

                         (i)  the holder of such Company Share Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Parent Shares (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(e)) and the payment
of the Pro Rata Cash Distribution and, upon any payment of Contingent Deferred
Merger Consideration, such holder's Pro Rata Contingent Distribution; and

                         (ii) the Company Share Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled.

                         In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
applicable Parent Shares, Pro Rata Cash Distribution and Pro Rata Contingent
Distribution may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the
Company Share Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Company Share
Certificate representing such shares of Company Stock is presented to Parent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
evidence that (i) the shares are transferable and (ii) any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.

                         Until surrendered as contemplated by this Article II,
each Company Share Certificate shall, subject to appraisal rights under Utah Law
and Section 2.06, be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon surrender the applicable Parent Shares and Pro
Rata Cash Distribution with respect to the shares of Company Stock formerly
represented thereby to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(e), and any Pro
Rata Contingent Distribution payable to such holder pursuant to Section 2.02.

                    (b)  Escrow Fund.  Prior to or simultaneously with the
                         -----------
Closing, the Stockholders' Representative and Parent shall enter into an escrow
agreement (the "Escrow

                                       7

Agreement") with an escrow agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to
---------
the Stockholders' Representative (the "Escrow Agent") substantially in the form
                                       ------------
of Exhibit C hereto. Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, at the
    --------
Closing, Parent shall deposit one or more certificates representing, in the
aggregate, the Escrow Shares otherwise issuable into an escrow account, which
account is to be managed by the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Account"). In
                                                   --------------
connection with such deposit of the Escrow Shares with the Escrow Agreement and
as of the Effective Time, each holder of Company Stock will be deemed to have
received and deposited with the Escrow Agent each stockholder's pro rata
interest in the Escrow Shares as determined as of the Closing by reference to
such stockholder's ownership of shares of Common Stock (plus any additional
shares as may be issued upon any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization
effected by Parent after the Effective Time with respect to shares constituting
the Escrow Account), without any act of any stockholder. Distributions of any
Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account shall be governed by the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement (any Escrow Shares in the Escrow Account
being referred to as the "Escrow Fund"). The adoption of this Agreement and the
                          -----------
approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders shall constitute approval of
the Escrow Agreement and of all the arrangements relating thereto, including
without limitation the placement of the Escrow Shares in escrow and the
appointment of the Stockholders' Representative. No portion of the Escrow Fund
shall be contributed in respect of any Company Options or any warrant or other
security exercisable or convertible into Company Common Stock. No Parent Shares
contributed to the Escrow Fund shall be unvested or subject to any right of
repurchase, risk of forfeiture or other condition in favor of the Surviving
Corporation.

               (c)  Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Shares.  No
                    -------------------------------------------------------
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with
respect to Parent Shares comprising part of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Share Certificate with respect to the Parent Shares
represented thereby until the holder of such Company Share Certificate shall
surrender such Company Share Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.03.

               (d)  No Further Rights in Company Stock.  All Parent Shares
                    ----------------------------------
issued upon conversion of shares of Company Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof (and any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.03(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Stock.

               (e)  No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing
                    --------------------
fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Company Share Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Each holder of a fractional share interest shall be paid an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such
fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all
fractional share interests then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled
by the average of the closing sales price of a Parent Share as reported on the
Nasdaq National Market for each of the five consecutive trading days ending on
the trading day immediately preceding the Closing.

               (f)  No Liability.  Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
                    ------------
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any such shares of
Company Stock (or

                                       8
<PAGE>

dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash properly and legally
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

               (g)  Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
                    ------------------
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Stock such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

               (h)  Market Standoff. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
                    ---------------
contained in this Agreement, no Parent Shares (or certificates therefor) shall
be issued in exchange for any Company Stock Certificates to any Stockholder and
no Pro Rata Cash Distribution or Pro Rata Contingent Distribution shall be paid
to any Stockholder until such Stockholder shall have delivered to Parent and the
Company a duly executed Voting Agreement.

               (i)  Lost Certificates.  If any Company Share Certificate shall
                    -----------------
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Company Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Company Share Certificate, Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Share Certificate, the applicable Parent Shares (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(e)) to which such
person is entitled pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

               (j)  Return of Parent Shares.  Promptly following the end of the
                    -----------------------
fourth full calendar month after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
return to the Surviving Corporation all of the remaining Parent Shares and the
Exchange Agent's duties shall terminate. Thereafter, upon the surrender of a
Company Share Certificate to the Surviving Corporation and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Surviving Corporation, and subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws, the holder of such
Company Share Certificate shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor,
the applicable Parent Shares (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.03(e)) and Pro Rata Cash Distribution, without any interest thereon,
and in addition, shall be entitled to receive such holder's Pro Rata Contingent
Distribution to the extent any such distributions have been paid prior to such
surrender, without interest thereon, or are paid thereafter.

               SECTION 2.04   Stock Transfer Books.  At the Effective Time, the
                              --------------------
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
certificates representing shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Company Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law.

               SECTION 2.05   Company Options.  At the Effective Time, all
                              ---------------
options to purchase Common Stock issued by the Company pursuant to its stock
option plans or otherwise ("Company Options") whether vested or unvested, shall
                            ---------------
be assumed by Parent. Immediately after the Effective Time, each Company Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to
constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as is equal to the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the unexercised portion of such option
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole number). The
exercise price per share of each such assumed Company Option shall be equal to
the exercise price of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by the Company Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).
The term, vesting schedule, status as an "incentive stock option" under Section
422 of the Code, if applicable, and all of the other terms of the Company
Options shall otherwise remain unchanged. It is the intention of the parties
that the Options so assumed by Parent qualify following the Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such
Company Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective
Time. Within 30 calendar days after the Effective Time, Parent will issue to
each person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of a
Company Option, a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option by
Parent. Within 90 calendar days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms)
which will register the shares of Parent Shares subject to assumed Company
Options to the extent permitted by Federal securities laws and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such
options remain outstanding.

               SECTION 2.06   Dissenting Shares.

               (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who have exercised and
perfected appraisal rights for such shares of Company Stock in accordance with
the URBCA (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
                              -----------------
represent the right to receive the applicable Parent Shares (or cash in lieu of
fraction shares ). Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock held by them in
accordance with the URBCA, unless and until such stockholders fail to perfect or
withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under the URBCA. All
Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock under the URBCA shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective
Time, the right to receive the applicable Parent Shares (or cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(e)), without any interest thereon,
upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.03, including the provision
of the Escrow Shares pursuant to Section 2.03(b) of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock.

               (b)  The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other related

                                       10
<PAGE>

instruments served pursuant to the URBCA and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to participate in and be consulted regarding all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the URBCA. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

                                  ARTICLE III
                                  -----------

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY
                 ---------------------------------------------

          The disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger
Sub concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure

--------
lettered paragraphs contained in this Article III.  The Company has used its
good faith efforts to provide conspicuous cross-references for each description
of an exception that may relate to more than one representation contained in
Article III.  If through oversight the Company has failed to cross-reference
properly, disclosure with respect to a specific section shall be deemed to be
disclosures with respect to other applicable sections.  Except as set forth in
the Company Disclosure Schedule, which provides an exception to or otherwise
qualifies in reasonable detail and with specific Section references, the
representations or warranties of the Company specifically referred to therein,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Utah and has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing or to have such corporate power and authority have not had, and
could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed
and in good standing that have not had, and could not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change in or effect on the
      -------------------------------
business of the Company that is materially adverse to the business, operations,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company taken as a whole,
except for any such changes or effects resulting from or in connection with (a)
any changes in general economic conditions, (b) any decline in the manner in
which businesses such as the Company are valued or any adverse changes in the

forth in Section 3.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Section 3.04(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all agreements that provide the Company
repurchase options to which any of such shares is subject.

               (b)  The Company has reserved (i) 1,500,000 shares of Company

whether such Company Option has been designated an "incentive stock options" as
defined in Section 422 of the Code. No Company Option will by its term require

acceleration of vesting in favor of any optionee under any Company Option;
(viii) any additional benefits for any optionee under any Company Option; or
(ix) the inability of Parent after the Effective Time to exercise any right or
benefit held by Company prior to the Effective Time with respect to any Company
Option assumed by Parent, including, without limitation, the right to repurchase
an optionee's unvested shares on termination of such optionee's employment. The
assumption by Parent of Company Options in accordance with Section 2.04
hereunder will not (x) give the optionees additional benefits which they did not
have under their options prior to such assumption (after taking into account the
existing provisions of the options, such as their respective exercise prices and
vesting schedules) or (xi) constitute a breach of a stock option plan of Company
or any agreement entered into pursuant to such plan.

which they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Stock. There
are no contractual obligations of the Company to provide funds to, or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) to any
other Person. The holders of Company Options have been or will be given, or

Each of the Company and each Subsidiary has performed all obligations required
to be performed by it under each Plan, and is not in any respect in default
under or in violation of, and has no knowledge of any default or violation by
any party to, any Plan. No action, claim or proceeding is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims
for benefits in the ordinary course) and no fact or event exists that could give
rise to any such action, claim or proceeding. Neither the Company nor any Person
that is a member of the same controlled group as the Company or under common
control with the Company within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code (each an
"ERISA Affiliate") is subject to any penalty or tax with respect to any Plan
 ---------------

the Plan for which determination letters are currently available that the Plan
is so qualified and each trust established in connection with any Plan that is
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and
no fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination letter or
letters from the IRS to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Plan
or the exempt status of any such trust.

               (g)  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any
liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than
liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in
the ordinary course), including, without limitation, any liability in connection
with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject

Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists that could give rise to any
such liability.

               (h)  All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made
or accrued with respect to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates.
All such contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no
such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Entity and

interest in and to all the Company Proprietary Rights (as defined in Section
3.14(b) below) free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, claims, rights of use
and restrictions whatsoever. Any of the Company Proprietary Rights (as defined
in Section 3.14(b) below) which require the execution and filing with an
appropriate governmental agency, including without limitation the Patent and
Trademark Office, have been so indicated in Section 3.14(a)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Any of the Company Proprietary Rights owned at any time by
any predecessor of Company or by any former employer of any employee or officer
of Company (collectively, "Former Owners") have been assigned in full to Company
by a presently valid and enforceable instrument. There are no outstanding
options, licenses or agreements of any kind relating to the Company Proprietary
Rights (other than for distribution of standard object code products in the
ordinary course of business) nor is Company a party to any options, licenses or
agreements of any kind with respect to the Proprietary Rights of any other
Person or entity which relates to the business of Company as conducted or as
proposed to be conducted.

                    (ii)    The Company Proprietary Rights do not infringe upon
or conflict with any Proprietary Rights of any other Person, firm, corporation
or other entity. There is not pending or threatened any claim or litigation
contesting the right of Company to engage in its business or employ any of the
Company Proprietary Rights. No Former Owner owns or controls Proprietary Rights
that such Former Owner could exercise to prevent Company from exploiting the
Company Proprietary Rights that were assigned from such Former Owner to Company.
Company has taken reasonable security measures to protect the secrecy,
confidentiality, and value of all Company Proprietary Rights. Company has only
disclosed Company Proprietary Rights to third parties subject to valid, binding
and enforceable non-disclosure agreements that protect such disclosed Company
Proprietary Rights at least as much as Company protects Company Proprietary
Rights, and in no case permits less than reasonable protection. Company has not
disclosed any software source code to any third parties.

                    (iii)   Any employee, consultant or other Person who, either
alone or in concert with others, developed, invented, discovered, derived,
programmed or designed any of the Company Proprietary Rights or any part
thereof, or who has knowledge of or access to information relating to it, has
been put on notice that the Company Proprietary Rights are proprietary to
Company and not to be divulged or misused, and has assigned or licensed all of
his or her rights relating to the Company Proprietary Rights to Company. No
employee of Company is in violation of any material term of any employment
contract, confidentiality, proprietary information or inventions agreement, or
any other contract or agreement relating to the

                                       22
<PAGE>

relationship of any such employee with Company or any previous employer, and all
such contracts or agreements with employees are in full force and effect and are
valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their respective provisions.
The employees of Company are not obligated under any contract (including
licenses, covenants, or commitments of any nature) or other agreement, or
subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative agency
that would conflict with their obligation to use their best efforts to promote
the interests of Company or that would conflict with the business of Company as
conducted or as proposed to be conducted.

                    (iv)    There are no material contracts, commitments,
leases, permits, and other instruments (written or oral) binding upon Company
with respect to the Company Proprietary Rights except the contracts listed on
Section 3.14(a)(iv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Company has delivered to
Parent true and complete copies of all such items and any amendments thereto.
All of such contracts, commitments, leases, permits and instruments are in full
force and effect and are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their
respective provisions, and Company is not in material default nor has there
occurred an event or condition which, with the passage of time or giving of
notice (or both), would constitute a material default with respect to the
payment or performance of any obligation thereunder; and no claim of such a
material default has been asserted and there is no basis or alleged basis upon
which such a claim could be made. Company has not received any notice or notices
claiming any such material default or indicating the desire or intention of any
other party thereto to amend, modify, rescind or terminate the same.

plan or other circumstance that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

               SECTION 3.32 No Misstatements. No representation or warranty made

by Parent and Merger Sub through the exercise of their respective best efforts
and for so long as Parent and Merger Sub continue to exercise such best efforts,
the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(e) unless

nature, cannot be cured); or

                              ---------------------
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void, there shall be no liability under this Agreement on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective officers or

--------  -------
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for the
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set

the Effective Time for a period of twelve (12) months. The Representations and
Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub do not survive the Effective Time and shall
terminate as of the Effective Time. Neither the period of survival nor the
liability of a party hereto with respect to such party's representations and
warranties shall be reduced by any investigation made at any time (whether
before or after the Effective Time) by or on behalf of another party hereto or
by any actual, implied or constructive knowledge or notice of any facts or
circumstances that any party may have as a result of any such investigation or
otherwise. If written notice of a claim has been given prior to the expiration
of the applicable representations and warranties by a party hereto to another
party hereto, then the relevant representations and warranties shall survive as
to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved.

Stockholders, jointly and severally, for any and all Liabilities, losses,
damages of any kind, diminution in value, claims, costs, expenses, fines, fees,
deficiencies, interest, awards, judgments, amounts paid in settlement and

fees and expenses and other costs of defending, investigating or settling
claims) actually suffered or incurred by them (including, without limitation, in
connection with any action brought or otherwise initiated by any of them)
(hereinafter, a "Loss"), arising out of or resulting from:
                 ----

                    (i)   the breach of any representation or warranty (without
giving effect to any qualification as to materiality (or similar qualifications)
contained therein) made by the Company or such Stockholder in the Acquisition
Documents;

                    (ii)  the breach of any covenant or agreement made by the
Company or such Stockholder in the Acquisition Documents;

                    (iii) Losses from breach of contract or other claims made by
any party alleging to have had a contractual or other right to acquire the
Company's capital stock or assets; or

                    (iv)  the value of any tax deduction lost by the Company by
virtue of the application of Section 280G of the Code.

               (b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, except with respect to claims based on fraud:

<PAGE>

                    (i)  the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in Section 9.02(a) that
may be recovered from the Stockholders shall not exceed 10% of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration; and

                    (ii) no indemnification payment by the Stockholders with
respect to any indemnifiable Loss otherwise payable under Section 9.02(a) and
arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in Section 9.02(a) shall
be payable until such time as all such indemnifiable Losses shall aggregate to
more than $250,000, after which time the Stockholders shall be liable in full
for all indemnifiable Losses in excess of $250,000, provided, however, that the
limitations set forth above in each of clauses (i) and (ii) shall not be
operative with respect to Losses arising from breaches of any of the Company
Basic Representations. As used herein, Company Basic Representations shall mean
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.04 and 3.05.

               SECTION 9.03   Indemnification Procedures.
                              --------------------------
               (a)  For purposes of this Section 9.03, a party against which
indemnification may be sought is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party" and the
                                                     -----------------
party which may be entitled to indemnification is referred to as the
"Indemnified Party".
 -----------------

               (c)  The obligations and Liabilities of Indemnifying Parties
under this Article IX with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third
party which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this Article IX
("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and contingent upon the following
  ------------------
additional terms and conditions: if an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of
any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give all Indemnifying Parties
notice of such Third Party Claim within 90 days of the receipt by the
Indemnified Party of such notice; provided, however, that the failure to provide
                                  --------  -------
such notice shall not release an Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this Article IX except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure. The notice of claim shall describe in
reasonable detail the facts known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such
indemnification claim, and the amount or good faith estimate of the amount
arising therefrom.

               (d)  If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that
may result from such Third Party Claim (and in the case where a Parent
Indemnified Party is the Indemnified Party, (i) Parent has reasonably determined
that losses which may be incurred as a result of the Third Party Claim do not
exceed individually, or when aggregated with all other losses subject to
indemnification under Section 9.02, the maximum aggregate amount of
indemnifiable losses set forth in such Section, (ii) the Third Party Claim
involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable
remedy, (iii) settlement of or an adverse judgement with respect to the Third
Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgement of Parent, likely to establish a
precedential custom or practice adverse to the continuing business interests of
Parent or to increase the Tax liability of Parent or the Company), then the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such
Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice (such counsel
to be reasonably acceptable to Parent) if it gives notice of its intention to do
so to the Indemnified Party within ten days of the receipt of such notice from
the Indemnified Party; provided, however, if there exists or is reasonably
                       --------  -------
likely to exist a conflict of

                                       48
<PAGE>

interest that would make it inappropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified
Party, in its reasonable discretion, for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to retain its own counsel, in each jurisdiction for which the
Indemnified Party determines counsel is required, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right
to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided
above, the Indemnifying Party shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party,
at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials
and information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying
Party. Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly,
conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make
available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all
such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Party's
possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No such Third Party Claim may be
settled by any party conducting the defense against such claim without the prior
written consent of the other party; provided, however, if the Stockholders are
                                    --------  -------
the Indemnifying Parties and are not entitled to assume the defense against such
Third Party Claim pursuant to this paragraph, the Parent Indemnified Party shall
have the right to consent to the entry of any judgement or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem
appropriate (and Parent need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the
Stockholders or the Stockholders' Representative in connection therewith).

               SECTION 9.04   Stockholders' Representative. GMS Capital
                              ----------------------------

and with respect to any actions to be taken by the Stockholders' Representative
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Stockholders shall be bound
by all actions taken by the Stockholders' Representative in its capacity
thereof, except for any action that conflicts with the limitation set forth in
the final sentence of this Section 9.04. The Stockholders' Representative shall
promptly, and in any event within five business days, provide written notice to
the Stockholders of any action taken on their behalf by the Stockholders'
Representative pursuant to the authority delegated to the Stockholders'
Representative under this Section 9.04. The Stockholders' Representative shall
at all times act in his or her capacity as Stockholders' Representative in a
manner that the Stockholders' Representative believes to be in the best interest
of the Stockholders. Neither the Stockholders' Representative nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to any Person for any
error of judgment, or any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken, under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except in the case of the Stockholders'
Representative's gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The
Stockholders' Representative may consult with legal counsel, independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it

                                       49
<PAGE>

in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. The
Stockholders' Representative shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire
as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions
of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. As to any matters not expressly
provided for in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholders'
Representative shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any
action. Each Stockholder severally shall indemnify and hold harmless and
reimburse the Stockholders' Representative from and against such Stockholder's
ratable share of any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses suffered or incurred by the Stockholders' Representative arising out of
or resulting from any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders'
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, other than such
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses arising out of or
resulting from the Stockholders' Representative's gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the
Escrow Agreement, (a) the Stockholders' Representative is not authorized to, and
shall not, accept on behalf of any Stockholder any merger consideration to which
such Stockholder is entitled under this Agreement and (b) the Stockholders'
Representative shall not in any manner exercise, or seek to exercise, any voting
power whatsoever with respect to shares of capital stock of the Company or
Parent now or hereafter owned of record or beneficially by any Stockholder
unless the Stockholders' Representative is expressly authorized to do so in a
writing signed by such Stockholder. In all matters relating to this Article IX,
the Stockholders' Representative shall be the only party entitled to assert the
rights of the Stockholders, and the Stockholders' Representative shall perform
all of the obligations of the Stockholders hereunder. Parent shall be entitled
to rely on all statements, representations and decisions of the Stockholders'
Representative.

                                 Schedule 6.12

                        REGISTRATION RIGHTS PROVISIONS


1.  The Parent shall:

          (a)  Furnish to each holder of Parent Shares registered under this
Agreement (a "Holder") such numbers of copies of a prospectus, in conformity
with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as they
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Parent
Shares owned by them (the "Registrable Shares").

          (b)  Use its best efforts to register and qualify the securities
covered by the registration statement under such Blue Sky or other securities
laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by any holder;
provided that the Parent shall not be required in connection therewith or as a
--------
condition thereto to qualify to do business, subject itself to taxation or to
file a general consent to service of process in any such state or jurisdiction.

          (c)  Notify each holder of Registrable Shares covered by the
registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act")
of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in
the registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances then existing, and at the request of such Holder, prepare and
furnish to such Holder a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an
amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter
delivered to purchasers of such Registrable Shares, such prospectus shall not
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances then existing.

          (d)  Cause all Registrable Shares registered to be listed on each
securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Parent are then
listed.

          (e)  Provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Shares
registered hereunder and a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Shares, in each
case not later than the effective date of the registration.


          (f)  Maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for a
period of at least one (1) year.

     2.  Furnish Information.  It shall be a condition precedent to the
         -------------------
obligations of the Parent to take any action pursuant to this attachment with
respect to the Registrable Shares of any selling Holder that such Holder shall
furnish to the Parent such information regarding itself, the Registrable Shares
held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall
be required by the Securities Act to effect the registration of such Holder's
Registrable Shares.
<PAGE>

     3.  Expenses of Registration.  The Parent shall bear and pay all costs and
         ------------------------
expenses including, without limitation, all registration filing fees, printing
expenses, fees and expenses incurred in connection with complying with state
securities or blue sky laws (other than those which by law must be paid by the
selling shareholders), fees of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. and fees of transfer agents and registrars relating to such offering
incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications except (a)
any underwriters' or brokers' commissions or discounts applicable to the
Registrable Shares to be sold by any Holder; (b) Blue Sky or state securities
laws fees which by law must be paid by selling Holder rather than the Parent,
(c) all fees or expenses expressly applicable to securities being sold by the
holder of Registrable Shares, and (d) fees or expenses of such Holder's
individual counsel (the Parent being responsible to pay the reasonable fees of
one counsel for the Holders).

     4.  Indemnification.  In the event any Registrable Shares are included in a
         ---------------
registration statement under this Agreement:

         (a)  To the extent permitted by law, the Parent will indemnify and hold
harmless each Holder, if joining in a registration, and each of its directors,
officers and controlling persons and each underwriter within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")
(each, an "indemnified person") against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, to which they may become subject under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any other statute, at common law or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based on any untrue or alleged untrue statements of
any material fact contained in the registration statement, including any
preliminary prospectus or final prospectus, or any amendments or supplements
thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading or arise out of any violation by the
Parent of any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act applicable to the Parent and relating to action or inaction
required of the Parent in connection with any the registration; and will
reimburse each such indemnified person for any reasonable legal or other
expenses incurred by them in connection with defending any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action; provided that the indemnity agreement contained in
this Section shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the
consent of the Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) nor shall the Parent be liable in any such case for any such loss,
claim, damage, liability, action or expenses to the extent that they arise out
of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission made in connection with the registration statement,
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto,
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished for use in
connection with the registration by any such indemnified person.

         (b)  To the extent permitted by law, each Holder, if joining in a
registration, will indemnify and hold harmless the Parent, each of its
directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement and
each person, if any, who controls the Parent within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities joint or several, to which the Parent or any such director, officer
or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, any other statute, at common
<PAGE>

law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the registration
statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus, or any
amendments or supplements thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in
each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that the registration
statement, preliminary or final prospectus, or amendments or supplements
thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
by such Holder expressly for use in connection with the registration; and such
Holder will reimburse any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by the
Parent or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section shall not apply
to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action if such settlement is effected without the consent of such Holder (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

         (c)  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified
party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it
shall wish, to assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel
satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the
defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified
party under this Section 6.6 for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected,
provided, however, that, if the defendants in any such action include both the
--------  -------
indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnifying party shall
have reasonably concluded that (i) there may be reasonable defenses available to
the indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available
to the indemnifying party or (ii) the interests of the indemnified party
reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying
party, the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate counsel
and to assume such legal defenses and otherwise to participate in the defense of
such action, with the reasonable and actual expenses and fees of such separate
counsel and other expenses related to such participation to be reimbursed by the
indemnifying party as incurred. The failure to deliver written notice to the
indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such
action shall not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the
indemnified party under this Section 6.6 except to the extent (and only to the
extent) of any actual prejudice suffered by the indemnifying party.

         (d)  If the indemnification provided for in this Section is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with
respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to therein,
then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party
hereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
party as a result of such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection
with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim,
damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. This
relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall
<PAGE>

be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified
party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.


         (e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions
on indemnification and contribution contained in an underwriting agreement
entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict
with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement
shall control.

         (f)  The obligations of the Parent and Holders under this Section shall
survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Shares in a registration
statement under this Agreement, and otherwise. No indemnifying party, in the
defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

     5.  Reports Under Securities Law.  Until two years following the Effective
         ----------------------------
Time, the Parent shall:

         (a)  file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Parent under the Exchange Act (at any time after it
has become subject to such reporting requirements); and


         (b)  furnish to each Holder upon request a written statement by the
Parent that it has compiled with the reporting requirements of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to such
reporting requirements), a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of
the Parent, and such other reports and documents so filed by the Parent as may
be reasonably requested in availing the Holder of any rule or regulation of the
SEC permitting the selling of any such securities without registration.

     6.  Stop Notice.  Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice (a
         -----------
"Stop Notice") from the Parent that the Board of Directors of the Parent has
determined, in its good faith reasonable judgment, that the disposition of the
Shares pursuant to the registration statement would materially interfere with,
or require the premature disclosure of, any financing, acquisition or
reorganization involving the Parent or any of its subsidiaries, or otherwise
would require premature disclosure of any other material nonpublic information
as to which the Parent has a good faith, bona fide business purpose for
maintaining its confidentiality (the "Board of Directors' Determination"), such
Holder will immediately discontinue disposition of the Shares pursuant to the
registration statement until such Holder's receipt of a copy of a supplemented
or amended prospectus or written notice from the Parent that the reason for the
Board of Directors' `Determination has lapsed and, if so directed by the Parent,
such Holder shall deliver to the Parent (at the expense of the Parent) or
destroy (and deliver to the Parent a certificate of destruction) all copies in
its possession, of the prospectus covering the Shares current at the time of
receipt of the Stop Notice; provided, however, that any restriction on trading
                            --------  -------
resulting from a Board of Directors' Determination shall be limited to a maximum
of thirty (30) consecutive days
<PAGE>

and ninety (90) days in any 12-month period; and, provided further, that the
period set forth in Section 1 of this attachment shall be extended by one day
for each day that a Stop Notice remains in effect.

     7.  Assignment of Registration Rights.  The right to cause the Company to
         ---------------------------------
register Registrable Shares pursuant to this Agreement may be assigned by any
Holder to a transferee or assignee of Registrable Shares; provided such transfer
is permitted under applicable securities laws.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Company has registered Registrable Shares pursuant to a registration
statement which has been declared effective by the Commission and, thereafter, a
Holder purports to assign all or a portion of the Registrable Shares to any
other person, the assignee shall have the right to cause the registration
statement to be amended or supplemented to name such assignee as a selling
shareholder so long as (i) the filing of a supplement or post-effective
amendment is permitted by applicable law for such purpose and (ii) all costs and
expenses to the Company, including without limitation legal and accounting
expenses, incurred to so amend such registration statement shall be paid by the
assignee requesting such amendment (or shared on a pro rata basis to the extent
more than one assignee requests such amendment).
