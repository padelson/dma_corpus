## 7.3 _Title Defects_.

  

### (a) Buyer must deliver to the Company in writing at least three business
days prior to the Closing Date (the "Notification Deadline") a written notice
specifying each alleged defect associated with the Ownership Interests in the
Oil and Gas Properties that it asserts constitutes a violation of the
representations set forth in Section 4.21 (a "Title Defect"), a description
of each such Title Defect and Buyers proposed Title Defect Value for such
Title Defect. If such notice is not timely submitted, Buyer will be deemed to
have waived any basis for an adjustment based on a violation of the
representations set forth in Section 4.21, as well as waived its basis for
any claim or other assertion of rights or damages based on a breach of such
representations.

  

### (b) Buyer may request an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price at any
time on or before the Notification Deadline, if the adjustment is based on a
Title Defect. A notice requesting an adjustment must be made in accordance
with Section 7.3(a).  If Buyer gives notice under subsection (a) above, the
parties will meet and use their best efforts to agree on the validity of the
claim and, if applicable, the amount of the adjustment, using the following
criteria:

  

#### (i) If the claim is based on the Company owning a different net revenue
interest than that shown on _Exhibit "A"_ , then the adjustment will be the
absolute value of the number determined by the following formula:

        

Adjustment = A x (1-[B/C])

  

A = Allocated Value for the affected Ownership Interest

  

B = Correct net revenue interest for the affected Ownership Interest

  

C = Net revenue interest for the affected Ownership Interest as shown on
_Exhibit "A"_

  

#### (ii) If the claim is based on an obligation or burden that is
liquidated, the adjustment will be the sum necessary to remove the obligation
or burden from the affected Ownership Interest.

  

#### (iii) If the claim is based on an obligation or burden that is not
liquidated, but can be estimated with reasonable certainty, the adjustment
will be the sum necessary to compensate Buyer for the adverse economic effect
on the affected Property.

  

### (c) If the amount of the adjustment for each Title Defect cannot be
determined based on the above criteria, and if Buyer, Seller and the Company
cannot otherwise agree on the amount of an adjustment or the parties are
unable to agree upon whether a Title Defect exists, subject to the provisions
of Section 7.3(d) below, the Parties shall agree to resolve the dispute under
the arbitration provisions in this Agreement.

  

### (d) No adjustment to the Base Purchase Price for Title Defects shall be
made unless and until the aggregate value of all Title Defects (herein called
the "Aggregate Title Defect Value") exceeds one percent (1%) of the Base
Purchase Price, and once the deductible is exceeded, only the value of all
Title Defects in excess of such deductible shall be considered in applying
this Section 7.3.

  

### (e) For purposes of this section, the costs to cure a Title Defect under
Section 7.3(b) above shall not be counted towards the Aggregate Title Defect
Value.

  

### (f) Seller may, at its sole option, notify Buyer on or before the Closing
that it elects to cure some or all of the Title Defects. No price adjustment
will be made for Title Defects that Seller elects to cure. If any Title
Defect is not cured prior to Closing, an adjustment to the Base Purchase
Price will be calculated under the criteria set forth in this section, but
only if the net amount of all adjustments based on the Title Defects exceeds
the Aggregate Title Defect Value.

  

### (g) If, prior to the Closing, any portion of the Oil and Gas Properties
or related equipment is destroyed or impaired by fire or other casualty,
Buyer may elect:

  

#### (i) to treat such destruction or impairment as a Title Defect in
accordance with this Section 7.3, or

  

#### (ii) to purchase the Membership Interests notwithstanding any such
destruction (without adjustment to the Purchase Price therefor), in which
case, Seller shall, at the Closing, pay to Buyer all sums paid to the Company
or Seller

        

#### by third-parties (including insurance proceeds relating thereto) and
assign to Buyer all sums to which Seller is entitled, as the case may be, by
reason of the destruction of such Oil and Gas Properties or related equipment
and shall assign, transfer and set over unto the Company or Buyer all of the
right, title and interest of Seller in and to any unpaid awards or other
payments from third-parties arising out of the destruction of such Oil and
Gas Properties or related equipment.

  

### (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.3, the
adjustments attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any Oil and
Gas Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such particular Oil and
Gas Property.

  

### (i) All Title Defects not raised within the time period provided in
paragraph (b) above shall be waived by Buyer for all purposes, including but
not limited to Article XII.

  

## 7.4 _Environmental Defects_.

  

### (a) Buyer shall have the right to conduct an environmental assessment of
the Oil and Gas Properties during the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and ending at the close of business on the Notification Deadline.
The confidentiality obligations of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
be applicable to all information acquired by Buyer in the course of
its environmental assessment. During normal business hours and after
providing the Company and Seller reasonable prior notice of any such
activities, Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted to enter upon
the Oil and Gas Properties and all buildings and improvements thereon,
inspect the same, review files and generally conduct such
tests, examinations, and investigations as are consistent with the American
Society for Testing and Materials standard Phase I environmental audit and
which have been approved by Company in writing.  Seller will have the right
to (i) witness such investigation and (ii) promptly receive a copy of all
results, analyses and reviews.

  

### (b) Buyer will notify Seller on or before the Notification Deadline of
(i) the existence of any environmental condition on the Oil and Gas
Properties that Buyer reasonably believes constitutes a breach of the
Companys representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.22
("Environmental Defect"), and (ii) the estimated cost to remediate or
cure such condition on each individual Oil and Gas Property, determined
utilizing the most cost effective and appropriate method of cure or
remediation available under the circumstances. With respect to any
Environmental Defect:

  

#### (i) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to undertake
such remedial action as may be required Environmental Law as currently
applied to cure by such Environmental Defect by sending written notice of its
binding commitment to effectuate such cure and the details and timing of such
curative action, and if such commitment is reasonably satisfactory to Buyer,
the Base Purchase Price would not be reduced on account of such Environmental
Defect

        

#### (ii) Buyer and Seller may also, upon their mutual agreement, set the
costs to cure the Environmental Defect and the Base Purchase Price shall be
reduced by such agreed costs while Buyer shall be responsible for any cure;
and

  

#### (iii) If, within fifteen (15) days following the notice of an
Environmental Defect as to any Oil and Gas Property, Buyer and Seller cannot
reach mutual agreement as contemplated in Section 7.4(b)(i) or (ii) above on
either the value of an Environmental Defect or whether an Environmental
Defect exists, the Parties agree to resolve the dispute under the arbitration
provisions in this Agreement.

  

### (c) No adjustment to the Base Purchase Price for Environmental Defects
shall be made unless and until the aggregate value of all Environmental
Defects (herein called the "Aggregate Environmental Defect Value") exceeds
one percent (1%) of the Base Purchase Price, and once the deductible is
exceeded, only the value of all Environmental Defects in excess of such
deductible shall be considered in applying this Section 7.4.

  

### (d) For purposes of this section, the costs to cure an Environmental
Defect determined under Section 7.4(b)(i) and (ii) above shall not be counted
towards the Aggregate Environmental Defect Value.

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.4, the
adjustments attributable to the effects of all Environmental Defects upon any
Oil and Gas Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such particular
Oil and Gas Property.

  

### (f) All Environmental Defects not raised within the time period provided
in paragraph (b) above shall be waived by Buyer for all purposes, including
but not limited to Article XII.

  

## 7.5 _Gas Imbalances_.  Within 120 days after the Closing Date, Seller and
Buyer shall, based upon data available at that time, determine (a) the total
amount of overproduction of gas attributable to and accounted for under the
name of the Company and related to the Oil and Gas Properties (e.g., volumes
of gas taken from the Leases, or on lands unitized therewith, by the Company
in excess of those volumes which the Company would be entitled to receive)
and (b) the total amount of underproduction of gas attributable to and
accounted for under the name of the Company and related to the Oil and Gas
Properties (e.g., volumes of gas not taken from the Leases, or on lands
unitized therewith, despite the Companys Ownership Interest in and right to
receive such volumes). If the total amount of overproduction (as
so determined) exceeds the total amount of underproduction (as so determined)
the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward in an amount equal to
US$5.72 per Mcf times such excess. If the total amount of underproduction (as
so determined) exceeds the total amount of overproduction (as so determined)
the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward in an amount equal to
US$5.72 per Mcf times such excess. The amount of any upward adjustment shall
be paid by Buyer to Seller, or the amount of any downward adjustment shall be
paid by Seller to Buyer, within five days after determination thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, only imbalances subject to legally enforceable
rights of recovery will be subject to the determination hereunder.

        

## 7.6 _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, the Company, FOC
and Seller shall afford to Buyers officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other representatives access, from the date hereof until the Closing
Date, to all of the properties, books, contracts, commitments, files and
records of the Company and, to the extent that they pertain to the Oil and
Gas Properties, FOC, as well as to the Companys, Sellers and FOCs officers
and employees (to the extent that any of FOCs officers and employees are
responsible for matters pertaining to the Company or its assets and
properties) and, during such period, the Company shall furnish to Buyer (a) a
copy of each material report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period and (b) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Buyer may
reasonably request. Buyer agrees that it will not, and will cause its
respective representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to
this Section 7.6 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall apply with respect to the information furnished thereunder and
hereunder, and any other activities contemplated thereby. Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and the Seller from and
against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, demands, assessments,
losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, settlements, penalties, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), of any nature
whatsoever asserted against or suffered by the Company or the Seller relating
to, resulting from or arising out of the conduct of Buyer or its
representatives in the course of any examinations or inspections made by
Buyer or its representatives under this Section 7.6, except to the extent of
gross negligence or wilfull misconduct on the part of Company, or any of its
employees, agents or Affiliates.

  

## 7.7 _Regulatory Approvals_. Each Party hereto shall cooperate and use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices,
petitions, filings and other documents, and use all commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain (and will cooperate with each other in obtaining) any

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or the taking of any
action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.

  

## 7.8 _Agreement to Defend_. In the event any claim, action,
suit, investigation or other proceeding by any governmental body or other

and use their commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond
thereto.

  

## 7.9 _Other Actions_.  Except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither
the Company, the Seller nor Buyer shall, nor permit any of its Affiliates to,
take or agree or commit to take any action that is reasonably likely to
result in any of its respective representations or warranties hereunder being
untrue in any material respect or in any of the conditions to the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in Article VIII not being
satisfied.  Each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth in this Agreement.

  

## 7.10 _LIMITATION AND DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF THE COMPANY AND SELLER_.  THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS

        

## AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY AND SELLER CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE

# **ARTICLE XI**

  

# **TERMINATION**

contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

  

### (a) by mutual written consent of the Company, Seller and Buyer;

  

### (b) by any of the Company, Seller or Buyer if any Governmental Entity
shall have issued any Injunction or taken any other action permanently

have become final and nonappealable;

  

### (c) (i) by Seller in the event of a material breach by the Buyer of one
or more provisions of this Agreement, in particular the representations and
warranties in Article VI above and (ii) by Buyer in the event of a material
breach by either the Seller or the Company of one or more provisions of this
Agreement, in particular the representations and warranties in Articles IV
and V above;

  

### (d) by Seller or Buyer if the total amount of uncured and unwaived Title
Defects and/or Environmental Defects exceeds 10% of the Base Purchase Price;

        

## 11.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  

### (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to
Section 11.1(c)(i) above or if all other Closing conditions have been
satisfied (other than those that can only be satisfied at Closing), except
that the condition in Section 8.1(f) has not been satisfied, Seller shall be
entitled to retain the Deposit, together with any interest earned thereon.
This shall be in the nature of liquidated damages for Buyers breach, and not
a penalty. If the Closing does not occur by July 31, 2007 or is terminated as
a result of a breach by Buyer as contemplated by Section 11.1(c)(i) above or
if the failure to close is the result of the condition in Section 8.1(f) not
being satisfied as contemplated above, the Sellers retention of the Deposit
is Sellers sole remedy against the Buyer. However, if this Agreement
does not close on the date specified above or is terminated due the
negligence, fault or willful failure of the Seller or for the reasons
described in Section 11.1(a), (b), (c)(ii), or (d), the Deposit, together
with any interest earned thereon shall be delivered to Buyer.

  

### (b) In the event of termination of this Agreement by any party hereto as
provided in Section 11.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any Party hereto
except (i) under the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) with respect to this
Section 11.2, the second and third sentences of Section 7.6, and Section
14.10, and (iii) to the extent that such termination results from the willful
breach by a Party hereto of any of its representations and warranties or of
any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

  

# **ARTICLE XII**

  

# **INDEMNIFICATION**

  

## 12.1 _Seller and FOC Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 12.4 hereof, the Seller and FOC hereby jointly and severally agree
to indemnify and hold Buyer and each of its Affiliates, and the
officers, directors, employees and agents thereof, harmless from and against
any and all claims, judgments, causes of action, liabilities, obligations,
guarantees, damages, losses, deficiencies, costs, penalties, interest and
expenses, including without limitation, cost of investigation and defense,
and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, net of any collected insurance
proceeds (collectively, "Losses"), arising out of, based upon, attributable
to or resulting from any, breach of a representation, warranty, agreement or
covenant of the Company or Seller contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or
"Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein).

  

## 12.2 _Buyer Indemnification_. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and
hold Seller, the Company, each of their respective Affiliates and each of
their respective officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from and
against any and all Losses arising out of, based upon, attributable to or
resulting from any breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or
covenant on the part of Buyer contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement
(without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Material
Adverse Effect" set forth therein).

        

## 12.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

  

### (a) If any third party asserts any claim against a Party to this
Agreement which, if successful, would entitle the Party to indemnification
under this Article XII (the "Indemnified Party"), it shall give notice of
such claim to the Party from whom it intends to seek indemnification (the
"Indemnifying Party") and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
assume the defense and, subject to Section 12.3(b), settlement of such claim
at its expense by representatives of its own choosing acceptable to the
Indemnified Party (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld). The
failure of the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party of such
claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that the
Indemnifying Party may have with respect to such claim, except to the extent
that the defense is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of such claim at its
expense (which expense shall not be deemed to be a Loss), in which case the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in providing information to and consulting
with the Indemnified Party about the claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails or
does not assume the defense of any such claim within 20 days after written
notice of such claim has been given by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party may defend against or, subject to
Section 12.3(b), settle such claim with counsel of its own choosing at the
expense (to the extent reasonable under the circumstances) of the
Indemnifying Party.

  

### (b) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a claim
involving the asserted liability of the Indemnified Party under this Article
XII, no settlement of such claim shall be made by the Indemnified Party
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of such a claim, (i) no settlement thereof may be
effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Partys consent
unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any
violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claim that
may be made against the Indemnified Party, (B) the sole relief provided is
monetary damages that have been paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and
(C) the settlement includes, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by
the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, from all
liability in respect of such claim, and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have
no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement thereof effected
without its consent.

  

## 12.4 _Limits on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:

  

### (a) Seller shall not have any obligation to provide indemnification for
Losses arising out of breaches of representations and warranties, unless the
amount of all such Losses pursuant to Section 12.1 exceeds US$250,000 (the
"Basket Amount"). The maximum aggregate amount for which Seller may be liable
under this Article XII for breaches of representations and warranties shall
be limited to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Base Purchase Price. This
paragraph (a) shall not apply to Losses suffered by a Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to Sections 4.3, 4.4 (but at only as to the last sentence thereof),
4.8, 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, 4.13, 4.25, 5.4, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8.

        

### (b) Buyer shall not have any obligation to provide indemnification for
Losses pursuant to Section 12.2 arising out of or related to breaches of
representations and warranties unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses
pursuant to such Section exceeds the Basket Amount in which case Buyer shall
be only liable to Seller for the amount of such Losses that exceed the Basket
Amount. The maximum aggregate amount for which Buyer may be liable under this
Article XII shall be limited to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Base
Purchase Price.

  

### (c) Except for the representations and warranties of (i) the Company in
Sections 4.21 and 4.22, the exclusive remedies for which are provided in
Sections 7.3 and 7.4, respectively, (ii) Seller contained in Section 5.6,
which shall survive indefinitely, and Section 4.25, which shall survive until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the respective
representations of the Company, Seller and Buyer contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing for a period of one year, and thereafter none of
the Company, Seller or Buyer shall have any liability whatsoever (whether
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise) with respect to such representation
or warranty. This Section 12.4(c) shall have no effect upon any other
obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement, whether to be
performed before, at or after the Closing, which shall survive until
fulfilled or the expiration in accordance with their terms.

  

### (d) Any payments made to Seller, the Company or the Buyer pursuant to
this Article XII shall constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and shall be treated as such by the Buyer and Seller on their Tax
Returns.

  

### (e) An Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Article XII for
Losses resulting from any event relating to a breach of a representation or
warranty if the Indemnifying Party can establish that the Indemnified Party
had actual knowledge on or before the Closing Date of such event.

  

### (f) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Article XII, Seller
hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer and each of its Affiliates
(including the Company), and the officers, directors, employees and agents
thereof, harmless from and against any and all Losses arising from any
litigation (i) which arises out of actions, conduct or events which occur
prior to the Effective Date or (ii) that was not disclosed to Buyer and which
arises out of actions, conduct or events that occurred between the Effective
Date and the Closing Date. This indemnity shall be subject to the procedures
of Section 12.3, and shall survive indefinitely.

  

# **ARTICLE XIII**

  

# **TAXES**

  

## 13.1 _Sales and Use Taxes; Property Taxes_. The Purchase Price, as adjusted
herein, is exclusive of any sales taxes and other transfer taxes in
connection with the sale of the Membership Interests. Buyer shall bear the
cost of all applicable sales taxes, real property transfer taxes, and filing
and recording fees payable as a result of the transfer of the Membership
Interests. If at any time after the Closing, Seller or any Affiliate shall
become liable for taxes or

        

## fees for which Buyer is responsible under this paragraph, Buyer shall
promptly reimburse Seller or such Affiliate for such taxes and fees,
including any penalties and interest thereon. Buyer shall defend, indemnify
and hold Seller harmless with respect to the payment of any such taxes and
fees, including any interest or penalties assessed thereon.

  

## 13.2 _Tax Proceedings_.  In the event Seller receives notice of any
payments due, claim, adjustment or other proceeding relating to Real or
Personal Property Taxes for the year in which the Effective Date occurs,
Seller shall notify Buyer in writing within 30 days of receiving notice
thereof. As to any such taxes Buyer shall, at Buyers expense, control or
settle the contest of such examination, claim, adjustment, or other
proceeding, and shall indemnify Seller against all losses, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities, claims, demands, penalties, fines,
assessments, settlements, and any related expenses in connection therewith.
If, on execution of this Agreement, Seller or the Company is actively
disputing any Real or Personal Property Tax assessments involving the Oil and
Gas Properties for the year in which the Effective Date occurs, Seller shall
fully inform Buyer of the basis for, and status of, the dispute and shall
permit Buyer to direct and/or participate in the dispute to the full extent
permitted by law.

  

## 13.3 _Real and Personal Property Taxes_. All ad valorem taxes, real
property taxes and personal property taxes ("Real and Personal Property
Taxes") for the year in which the Effective Date occurs shall be apportioned
as of the Effective Date between Seller and Buyer. Seller shall be liable
for the portion of such Real and Personal Property Taxes based upon the
number of days in the year occurring prior to the Effective Date, and
Buyer shall be liable for the portion of such taxes based upon the number of
days in the year occurring on and after the Effective Date. At least 5 days
prior to Closing, Seller will provide Buyer with the amount of Real and
Personal Property Taxes paid by Seller with respect to the year which
includes the Effective Date and the amount of such Taxes allocable to
Buyer, which amount shall be deducted from the Purchase Price at Closing.

  

## 13.4 _Property Tax Reporting_. Company has, or will have, filed any
such renditions, reports, or returns required to be filed with respect to
Real and Personal Property Taxes before Closing.  Buyer shall file all
reports and returns required to be filed or submitted after Closing that are
incident to Real and Personal Property Taxes assessed for the year in which
the Effective Date occurs but that are not submitted by Seller prior to the
Closing Date.  Buyer shall pay any assessed Real and Personal Property Taxes
assessed after Closing and shall invoice Seller for its allocable share of
such taxes, if any, pursuant to Section 13.3 above, which invoice shall be
paid promptly by Seller.

  

## 13.5 _Production Taxes_.  All Production Taxes (including deductions,
credits or refunds pertaining thereto) attributable to the ownership or
operation of, or production and revenue from, the Oil and Gas Properties
prior to the Effective Date are Sellers responsibility, and shall be
allocated to and paid by Seller. All Production Taxes (including deductions,
credits or refunds pertaining thereto) attributable to the ownership or
operation of, or production and revenue from, the Oil and Gas Properties on
and after the Effective Date are the responsibility of Buyer, and shall be
allocated to and paid by Buyer. Production Taxes will be allocated by the
Parties so that the Party which is entitled to the revenue from production
shall bear the burden of the Production Tax in respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any excess Production Tax credits

        

## available to the Company or Seller, but unused as of Closing shall accrue
to the Company or Buyer to the extent permitted by applicable law.

  

## 13.6 Income Taxes. Seller shall be responsible for Income Taxes imposed on
Seller to the extent they relate to any period, whether before, on, or after
the Effective Date, and all items of deduction, credit, loss or gain or
refund pertaining to Income Taxes imposed on Seller shall remain and belong
to Seller, no matter when received, assessed or paid. Buyer shall be
responsible for Income Taxes imposed on Buyer to the extent they relate to
any period, whether before, on, or after the Effective Date, and all items of
deduction, credit, loss or gain or refund pertaining to Income Taxes imposed
on Buyer shall remain and belong to Buyer, no matter when received, assessed
or paid.

  

## 13.7 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The allocation of the Purchase Price
in accordance with Exhibit A-2 is intended to comply with the allocation
method required by Section 1060 of the Code.  Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate to comply with all substantive and procedural requirements of
Section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including without
limitation the filing by Buyer and Seller of IRS Form 8594 with their federal
income tax returns for the taxable year in which the Closing occurs. Buyer
and Seller agree that neither will take, nor will they permit any Affiliate
to take, a position for income tax purposes that is inconsistent with the
allocation of the Purchase Price.

  

# **ARTICLE XIV**

  

# **GENERAL**

  

## 14.1 _Governing Law; Choice of Forum_. This Agreement shall be governed
and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to the conflict of law principles thereof. Any dispute arising
hereunder shall be brought, if at all, in the state or federal courts located
in Delaware. Each party agrees not to assert any argument of inconvenient
forum in response to the filing of an action in any such court.

  

## 14.2 _Amendments_.  This Agreement may only be amended by an instrument in
writing executed by Company, Buyer and Seller.

  

## 14.3 _Waivers_. The observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively) by the party entitled to enforce such term, but such waiver
shall be effective only if it is in a writing signed by the party entitled to
enforce such term and against which such waiver is to be asserted.  Unless
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no delay or omission on the
part of any party in exercising any right or privilege under this Agreement
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any
party of any right or privilege under this Agreement operate as a waiver of
any other right or privilege under this Agreement nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right or privilege preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or privilege under this
Agreement.

  

## 14.4 _Notices_. Any notice or other communications required or permitted
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sufficiently given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given

        

## upon receipt) if sent by overnight mail, registered mail or certified
mail, postage prepaid, or by hand, to the parties at the following addresses
(or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice):

## 14.5 _Successors and Assigns, Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.
Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be
assigned without the written consent of the other parties, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that Buyer may make an assignment
of its rights hereunder to its financing source for collateral security
purposes. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement, and no Person shall be deemed a third party beneficiary under
or by reason of this Agreement.

  

## 14.6 _Severability_.  If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be
declared judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall
not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this
Agreement, it being the intent and agreement of the parties that this
Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the extent
necessary to render it valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its
intent or, if such modification is not possible, by substituting therefor
another provision that is valid, legal and enforceable and that achieves the
same objective.

  

## 14.7 _Entire Agreement_.  This Agreement (including the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and the documents and
instruments executed and delivered in connection herewith) constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings,
whether written or oral, among the parties or any of them with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and there are no representations, understandings or
agreements relating to

        

## the subject matter hereof that are not fully expressed in this Agreement
and the documents and instruments executed and delivered in connection
herewith. All Exhibits and Schedules attached to this Agreement are expressly
made a part of, and incorporated by reference into, this Agreement.

  

## 14.8 _Schedules_.  Nothing in the Schedules is intended to broaden the
scope of any representation or warranty contained in the Agreement or to
create any covenant unless clearly specified to the contrary herein. Any
disclosure on one Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed on all Schedules
and under the Agreement. Inclusion of any item in the Schedules (a) shall be
deemed to be disclosure of such item on all Schedules and under
the Agreement, (b) does not represent a determination that such item is
material nor shall it be deemed to establish a standard of materiality, (c)
does not represent a determination that such item did not arise in the
ordinary course of business, (d) does not represent a determination that the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement require the consent of third
parties and (e) shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission to any
third party concerning such item. The Schedules include descriptions of
instruments or brief summaries of certain aspects of the Company and its
business and operations.  The descriptions and brief summaries are not
necessarily complete and are provided in the Schedules to identify documents
or other materials previously delivered or made available.

  

## 14.9 _Remedies_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that
(i) the provisions of this Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect
the proper and legitimate interests of the other parties hereto, and (ii) the
other parties hereto would be irreparably damaged in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties hereto shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement by
other parties hereto without the necessity of proving actual damages upon
posting of a suitable bond, and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof and thereof, which rights shall be cumulative and in
addition to any other remedy to which the parties hereto may be entitled
hereunder or at law or equity.

  

## 14.10 _Expenses_. The Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, shall bear their respective expenses (including, without limitation,
fees and disbursements of counsel, accountants and other experts) incurred in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, each of the other documents and instruments
executed in connection with or contemplated by this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  

## 14.11 _Release of Information; Confidentiality_. The parties shall
cooperate with each other in releasing information concerning this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. No press releases or other public
announcements concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be made by any party without prior consultation with and written
consent of each other party, except for any legally required communication by
any party and then only with prior consultation and at least 12 hours notice
together with copies of all drafts of the proposed text, prior to the time
the communication is made public.

  

## 14.12 _Certain Construction Rules_. The article and section headings and
the table of contents contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall in no way

        

## define, limit, extend or describe the scope or intent of any provisions of
this Agreement.  Whenever the context may require, any pronoun used in this
Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter
forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs shall include the
plural and vice versa. In addition, as used in this Agreement, unless
otherwise provided to the contrary, (a) all references to days, months or
years shall be deemed references to calendar days, months or years and (b)
any reference to a "Section," "Article," or "Schedule" shall be deemed to
refer to a section or article of this Agreement or an Exhibit or Schedule
attached to this Agreement. The words "hereof", "herein", and "hereunder" and
words of similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be
deemed to be exclusive.

  

## 14.13 _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed (including by
facsimile transmission) in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one
instrument binding on all the parties, notwithstanding that all the parties
are not signatories to the original or the same counterpart.
