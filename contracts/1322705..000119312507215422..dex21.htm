AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION, dated as of October 7, 2007
(this " _Agreement_ "), by and among Spansion Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Parent_ "), Atlantic Star Merger Sub Ltd., an Israeli company and a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Saifun
Semiconductors Ltd., an Israeli company (the " _Company_ ").

_RECITALS_

A. The Parent and the Company intend to enter into a transaction whereby
Merger Sub will merge (the " _Merger_ ") with and into the Company by way of a
court approved arrangement between the Company and its shareholders and
creditors, in accordance with Sections 350 and 351 of the Companies Law
5759-1999 of the State of Israel (together with the regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _Companies Law_ "), following which Merger Sub will cease
to exist and the Company will become a wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in
Section 8.7(h)) of the Parent, and the Company Shares (as defined in Section
1.3(b)) will be exchanged for the shares of Parent Common Stock (as defined
in Section 3.2), all in accordance with this Agreement and the Companies Law.

B. The board of directors of the Company by the unanimous vote of those
present (except for Dr. Eitan, who abstained on matters in which he may have a
personal interest): (i) determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Cash
Distribution (as defined in Section 5.12(a)) (collectively, the "
_Transactions_ "), are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and
its shareholders, and that, considering the financial position of the
merging companies, no reasonable concern exists that the Surviving Company
will be unable to fulfill the obligations of the Company to its creditors
existing as of immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) approved this Agreement,
the Merger and the other Transactions; and (iii) determined to recommend to
the shareholders of the Company the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and
the other Transactions.

C. The board of directors of each of the Parent and Merger Sub has approved
this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, and the board of
directors of Merger Sub has determined that, considering the financial
position of the merging companies, no reasonable concern exists that the
Surviving Company will be unable to fulfill the obligations of Merger Sub to
its creditors existing as of immediately prior to the Closing.

D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a condition to and
inducement of the Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement: (i)
certain shareholders of the Company as set forth in Schedule A (the " _Voting
Undertaking Shareholders_ ") are entering into irrevocable voting undertakings
in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A (the " _Voting Undertakings_
"); (ii) certain shareholders of the Company who may be deemed to be
affiliates of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the
United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "),
are entering into affiliate agreements in substantially the form attached as
Exhibit B (the " _Affiliate Agreements_ "); (iii) Dr. Eitan and certain of his
Affiliates (as defined in Section 8.7(a)) are entering into market stand-off
agreements in substantially the form attached as Exhibit C (the " _Lock-Up
Agreements_ "); and (iv)  ##### Table of Contents

  

 certain individuals as set forth in Schedule B are either entering into
retention and noncompetition agreements (the " _Retention and Noncompetition
Agreements_ ") or intend to enter into Retention and Noncompetition Agreements
after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing.

E. The Merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" as described in
Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to constitute a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of the regulations promulgated
under Section 368 of the Code.

_AGREEMENT_

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree
as follows:

 ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

 Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where
permissible) of the conditions in this Agreement as set forth in Article 6,
(a) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation (sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving
Company_ ") and shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent and
shall succeed to and assume all of the rights, properties and obligations of
Merger Sub; and (b) all Company Shares will be converted into the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.3, all
in accordance with the provisions of the Court Approval (as defined in
Section 5.2(a)), the Companies Law and this Agreement.

 Section 1.2 _Closing Date_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where

the closing of the Transactions, including the Merger (the " _Closing_ "),
shall take place at the offices of Yigal Arnon and Co., One Azrieli Center, Tel
Aviv, Israel (or at such other place as may be designated by the parties), at
a time and on a date to be designated by the parties (the date or time upon
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ " or
the " _Effective Time_ ", as applicable), which shall be no later than the
second Business Day (as defined in Section 8.7(b)) (or such other period of
time mutually agreed to by the parties) following the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions which by
their terms are to be satisfied or waived as of the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at such time), including the
receipt of the Court Approval.

 Section 1.3 _Effect on Share Capital_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(where permissible) of the conditions in this Agreement as set forth in
Article 6, at the Closing Date, subject to the provisions of the Court
Approval, the following shall occur:

2 ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) _Exchange of the Company Shares_. Each Ordinary Share, NIS 0.01 par value
per share, of the Company (the " _Company Shares_ "), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and immediately following the record
date for the Cash Distribution, other than any Company Shares owned by any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Company or any dormant shares (
_menayot redumot_ ) of the Company, shall automatically become owned by the
Parent and represent solely the right to receive (the " _Per Share
Consideration_ ") 0.7429 (as the same may be adjusted pursuant to Section
5.12(c), the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a share of Parent Common Stock, subject
to the provisions of Sections 1.3(e) and 1.3(f), payable to the holder of such
Company Share upon surrender of the certificate representing such Company
Share in the manner provided in Section 1.4 (or in the case of a lost, stolen,
destroyed or unissued certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit and bond in
the manner provided in Section 1.6). As of the Effective Time, all of the
Company Shares shall automatically be owned by the Parent, and will be
registered in its name in the shareholders registry of the Company.

(c) _Dormant Shares; Subsidiary-Owned Stock_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 1.3(b), at the Effective Time, each Company Share that is a
dormant share ( _menayah redumah_ ), owned by any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of the Company or owned directly or indirectly by the Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, shall not
be exchanged under Section 1.3(b) and no Per Share Consideration shall be
delivered with respect thereto.

(d) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, all options to purchase Company
Shares (" _Company Share Options_ ") then outstanding under the Companys
Employee Share Option Plan (1997), 2001 Share Option Plan and 2003 Share
Option Plan (as any of them may have been amended and/or restated prior to the
date hereof, a " _Company Option Plan_ " and, collectively, the " _Company
Option Plans_ ") whether vested or unvested, and the Company Option Plans
themselves, shall be assumed by the Parent in accordance with Section 5.11(a).

(e) _Adjustments_. Without derogating from any other provision of this
Agreement, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the
effect of any forward or reverse stock split, bonus shares (other than as
permitted to be issued to employees pursuant to Section 4.1), stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares
of Parent Common Stock or Company Shares), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Shares occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the
payment of the Cash Distribution shall not provide any basis for any such
adjustment to the Exchange Ratio.

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of
Company Shares who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that would otherwise be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender
of such holders Certificates (as defined in Section 1.4(c)), or affidavit and
the posting of a bond in the manner provided in Section 1.6, receive from the
Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest,  



 

3 ##### Table of Contents

  

 equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average
closing sale price of one share of Parent Common Stock for the
five consecutive trading days that the Parent Common Stock has traded ending
on and including the second trading day immediately prior to the Effective
Time (" _Parent Common Stock Closing Price_ "), as reported on The NASDAQ
Global Select Market (" _Nasdaq_ ").

 Section 1.4 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall select
Computershare Investor Services or another bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_
") in the Merger, to receive the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under
Section 1.3.

(b) _Parent to Provide Per Share Consideration_. At or as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article 1, the shares of
Parent Common Stock, issuable pursuant to Section 1.3 in exchange
for outstanding Company Shares. In addition, the Parent shall make available
from time to time, if and as necessary after the Effective Time, cash in an
amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
1.3(f) and for payment of any dividends or distributions to which holders of
Company Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.4(d). Such funds shall be
held in trust by the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders
of Company Shares. 

(c) _Payment and Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of one or more certificates (the "
_Certificates_ ") or uncertificated Company Ordinary Shares (the "
_Uncertificated Shares_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Company Shares, whose shares represent the right to
receive the Per Share Consideration pursuant to Section 1.3: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares to the
Exchange Agent), (ii) a declaration form in which the holder of record states
whether the holder is a resident of Israel as defined in the Income Tax
Ordinance of Israel [New Version], 1961 (the " _Ordinance_ ") and provides
such other information as the Parent shall reasonably require to comply with
the Ordinance and the Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling (as defined in Section
5.5(a)), if obtained, and (iii) instructions in customary form for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated
Shares in exchange for the Per Share Consideration. Upon (x) surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by the Parent or (y) receipt of an " _agent
s message_" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal and such declaration form, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Per Share Consideration payable with respect to their Company Shares (rounded
to the nearest whole share after aggregating all Company Shares held by such
holder), and the Certificates so  



 

4 ##### Table of Contents

  

 surrendered or Uncertificated Shares so transferred shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the amounts payable pursuant
to Section 1.3 upon the surrender of any Certificate or transfer of any
Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time for all corporate purposes to evidence only the right to
receive the Per Share Consideration to which such Company Shares are entitled
pursuant to Section 1.3 and, if applicable, an amount of cash in lieu of the
issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.3(f) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.4(d).

(d)  _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates
or untransferred Uncertificated Shares with respect to any shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such
Certificates shall surrender such Certificates or transfer such
Uncertificated Shares, _provided_ that in the event that such holders comply
with the provisions of Section 1.6, such holders shall be entitled to any such
dividends or distributions regardless of their having failed to surrender
such Certificates or transfer such Uncertificated Shares. Subject to
applicable Legal Requirements (as defined in Section 2.3(b)), following
surrender of any such Certificates or transfer of any such Uncertificated
Shares, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof,
without interest, certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.3(f) and the amount of any such dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If shares of Parent Common Stock issuable

any amounts under the Ordinance or any other provision of Israeli law, if
any, from the consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to such holder
shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such approval or
ruling. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, (i)

shall provide the holder of Company Shares from whom an amount was deducted or
withheld with a written notice, as may be required by any applicable law,

valid Uncertificated Share is transferred to the Exchange Agent or to the
Surviving Company or the Parent, such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in this Article 1. The

Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, or were never issued,
the Exchange Agent shall pay such amounts and, if applicable, issue such

Subsidiaries of the Company have not engaged any employees whose employment
would require special Approvals, and, except as disclosed in Section 2.11(j)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no unwritten Company policies or
customs which, by extension, could entitle Israeli Employees to benefits
in addition to what they are entitled by law (including, by way of example

 Company shall submit to the district court of Tel Aviv-Jaffa (the "
_Applicable Court_ ") a first motion to convene, in the manner set forth
in the Companies Law and the regulations promulgated pursuant to Sections 350
and 351 of the Companies Law (the " _Arrangement Regulations_ ") and as shall
be ordered by the Applicable Court, shareholders and, if required by
the Applicable Court, creditors meetings (the " _Company Meetings_ ") for the
approval of the terms and conditions of an arrangement between the Company and
its shareholders and/or creditors, including this Agreement, the Merger, the
Cash Distribution and the other Transactions, (the " _Merger Proposal_ ") by
a majority in number representing at least 75% of the votes cast in the
Company Meetings, (i) which majority shall include, for the purpose of
approving any issues which may be considered to be an interested party
transaction in accordance with Section 270(4) of the Companies Law, the
affirmative votes of at least one third (1/3) of the shares represented at the
Company Meetings held by Persons who are not affiliated with any controlling
shareholder of the Company as defined in Section 268 of the Companies Law (the

participants or (ii) that the total number of Non-Controlling Shares voted
against the Merger Proposal does not exceed 1% of the aggregate voting rights
in the Company (the " _Section 350 Vote_"). In such motion the Company will
inform the Applicable Court that upon the approval of the Merger Proposal by
the requisite majority at the Company Meetings, and subsequently by the
Applicable Court, such court approval would be relied upon by the Parent as an
approval of the Merger Proposal for the purpose of qualifying the issuance of
Parent Common Stock hereunder for the Section 3(a)(10) exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. As part of the notice of the
Company Meetings, the Company will deliver to each of its shareholders and,
if required by the Applicable Court, creditors a notice of the meetings, the

of the proposed Merger Proposal submitted to the court, a power of attorney
to attend the meetings in accordance with the Companies Law and a proxy card
for the vote (the " _Information Statement_ "). The Information Statement will
include a description of the rights of a shareholder or a creditor, as
applicable, to object to the Merger Proposal, information on the hearing
scheduled before the Applicable Court and any position of the Companys board
of directors with respect to the advisability of the Merger, which shall
comply with Section 5.1 and Section 5.2. The Parent agrees to provide the
Company for inclusion in the Information Statement information with respect to
itself and its Subsidiaries consistent in scope and detail as would be
required to be contained in a registration statement under the Securities
Act. Following the approval of the Merger Proposal by the shareholders and, if
applicable, the creditors as set forth above, the Company will submit to the
Applicable Court a second motion for (i) the approval of the arrangement and
the Merger Proposal and the order of all actions to be taken in accordance
with the Merger Proposal; and (ii) to hold a hearing on the fairness of the
Merger Proposal regardless of whether or not any objections to the Merger
Proposal are raised (these approvals when obtained shall be collectively
referred to as the " _Court Approval_ ").

(b) Each of the Company and the Parent shall cause their respective Israeli
counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all activities, and to
cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of the
Merger Proposal and all documents filed with respect to the Court Approval. In

Regulations and shall make all necessary actions in order to minimize the
term of such procedures.

or stipulation of the Applicable Court or as a result of an order or
stipulation of the Applicable Court that requires a vote of a class of
shareholders other than the holders of Company Shares or a class of creditors
other than the classes contemplated by the Company in the Merger Proposal. The
Companys obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Meetings in accordance with this Section 5.2(c) shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission

required in order for the board of directors of the Company to comply with
its fiduciary obligations to the Companys shareholders under applicable
Legal Requirements (which, for purposes of this Section 5.2(e)(iii), shall be
deemed to consist of Israeli Legal Requirements and in addition, in order to
determine the appropriate standards that would apply to such fiduciary
obligations, the board of directors of the Company may also consider Delaware
Legal Requirements); and (iv) the Merger Proposal has not yet been approved by

Company Share Options into options (the " _Assumed Options_ ") to purchase
shares of Parent Common Stock, in respect of Company Share Options subject to
Sections 3(i) or Section 102 of the Ordinance, will not result in an immediate
taxable event for the person holding such Company Share Options and, with
respect to Company Share Options subject to Section 102 of the Ordinance, will
not affect the original length of the holding period required with respect to
such Company Share Options, which ruling may be subject to such terms
regularly associated with such rulings (the " _Israeli Option Tax Ruling_ ");

(ii) a second ruling confirming that the obligation of any Israeli
shareholder consenting to such ruling to pay capital gains tax on the exchange
of the Company Shares for Parent Common Stock will qualify for deferral in
accordance with the provisions of Section 104H of the Ordinance and the terms
and conditions customary to such rulings (the " _104H Ruling_ ");



 

53 ##### Table of Contents

  

(iii) a third ruling (the " _Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling_ ") that
either (x) exempts the Parent, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Company
from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax at source from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, whether pursuant
to Section 104H of the Ordinance or otherwise, or clarifies that no such
obligation exists, or (y) clearly instructs the Parent, the Exchange Agent or
the Surviving Company how such withholding at source is to be executed, and in
particular, with respect to the classes or categories of holders or former
holders of Ordinary Shares or Company Share Options from which Tax is to be
withheld (if any), the rate or rates of withholding to be applied; and

(iv) a fourth ruling (the " _Cash Distribution Tax Ruling_ ", and together
with the 104H Ruling, the Israeli Option Tax Ruling and the Israeli
Withholding Tax Ruling, the " _Israeli Tax Rulings_ ") confirming that the
distribution of funds transferred from Saifun (BVI) Limited to the Company to
the holders of Company Shares will either (x) not be subject to Israeli
withholding requirements or (y) be subject to Israeli withholding requirements
as will be set out in the Cash Distribution Tax Ruling.

(b) Each of the Company and the Parent shall cause their respective Israeli
counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all activities, and to
cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of such
applications for the Israeli Tax Rulings and in the preparation of any written
or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
Israeli Tax Rulings. The Company, its representatives and advisors shall not
make any application to, or conduct any negotiation with, the Israeli Tax
authorities with respect to any matter relating to the subject matter of the
Israeli Tax Rulings without prior coordination with the Parent, and will
enable the Parents representatives and advisors to participate in all
discussions and meetings relating thereto. To the extent that the Parents
representatives and advisors elect not to participate in any meeting or
discussion, the Companys representatives and advisors shall provide a prompt
and full report of the discussions held. In any event, the final text of the
Israeli Tax Rulings shall in all circumstances be subject to the prior
written consent of the Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, it
being understood that the Parent may withhold such consent if any Israeli Tax
Ruling imposes restrictions or limitations upon the Parent or the Company
and/or fails to fully address the matters described in subsections 5.5(a)(i),
5.5(a)(iii) and 5.5(a)(iv) above to the reasonable satisfaction of the Parent.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to obtain the Israeli Tax Rulings, as promptly as
practicable.

(d) Each of the Company and the Parent shall cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with any Governmental Entity under Sections 5.4 and
5.5 to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the
applicable Legal Requirements. Whenever any event occurs which is required to
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any such document or filing,
the Company or the Parent, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the
other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable
Government Entity, such amendment or supplement.

 Section 5.6 _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.

(a) The parties acknowledge that the Parent and the Company have previously
executed a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2007 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement will continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and shall apply to any
information obtained pursuant to Section 5.6(b). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall not,
and shall each use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause its
representatives not to, use information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.6
for any purpose unrelated to consummation of the Transactions.

(b) Upon reasonable notice, except (i) as the Company reasonably determines
(after consultation with Parent and receiving and considering the advice of
the Companys outside legal counsel) is required by applicable Legal
Requirements, or (ii) as would reasonably be expected to violate or result in
a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work-product privilege (it
being understood that the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
such information to be provided in a manner that does not result in such
violation, loss or impairment, which reasonable best efforts shall include
entering into one or more joint defense or community of interest agreements
on customary terms if counsels to the parties reasonably conclude that such
agreements are likely to preserve the privilege), the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the Parent and to its officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records so that the Parent may obtain all information concerning
the business as its may reasonably request (including the status of product
development efforts (provided that the Parent and its representatives shall
conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company), and during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly
to the Parent (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
U.S. or Israeli federal or state securities laws and (b) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the
Parent may reasonably request (including the Companys outside accountants
work papers). No review or information obtained pursuant to this Section
5.6(b) shall limit the Parents or Merger Subs reliance on or the
enforceability of any representation or warranty made by the Company herein.

 Section 5.7 _No Solicitation_.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 7, and
except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the Company and its
Subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or knowingly permit any
of their respective officers, directors, controlled Affiliates or employees
or any of their respective investment bankers, attorneys or other advisors or
representatives to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or take any
action intended to encourage or induce the making, submission or announcement
of any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other

 than any officer, director, controlled Affiliate or employee of the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor
or representative of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or take any other
action intended to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or
(iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Transaction. Notwithstanding the above, prior to the approval of
the Merger Proposal at the Company Meetings, nothing contained in this
Agreement (including this Section 5.7) shall prohibit the board of directors
of the Company, in response to an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
that is not withdrawn, from engaging or participating in discussions or
negotiations with and furnishing information to the party making such
Acquisition Proposal,  _provided_ that the board of directors of the Company:
(A) in good faith and after consultation with the Companys financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, concludes that the offer is, or would reasonably be
likely to result within 20 (twenty) Business Days of the receipt of such
Acquisition Proposal in, a Superior Proposal, and (B) determines in good faith
after consultation with its outside legal counsel that such action is required
in order for the board of directors of the Company to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to the Companys shareholders under applicable Legal
Requirements (which, for purposes of this clause (B), shall be deemed to
consist of Israeli Legal Requirements and in addition, in order to determine
the appropriate standards that would apply to such fiduciary obligations, the
board of directors of the Company may also consider Delaware Legal
Requirements); and _provided further_ that (x) prior to, or concurrently
with, furnishing any such information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such party, the Company gives the Parent written notice of
the identity of such Person or group and of the Companys intention to
furnish information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such
party and (y) the Company receives from such party an executed confidentiality
agreement at least as restrictive as the Confidentiality Agreement (but
permitting disclosure to the Parent required under this Agreement); and (z)
prior to or contemporaneously with furnishing any such information to such
party, the Company furnishes such information to the Parent (to the extent
such information has not been previously furnished by the Company to the
Parent). The Company and its Subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all
existing discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is understood that any violation of the restrictions in this Section 5.7 by
any officer, director, controlled Affiliate or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or
other representative retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any other Person who shall have entered into a Voting Undertaking shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.7 by the Company.

For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal (other than an
offer or proposal by the Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person acting in
concert with the Parent or Merger Sub) relating to an
Acquisition Transaction;



 

56 ##### Table of Contents

  

(ii) " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean any transaction or series
of related transactions other than the Transactions involving: (A) any
acquisition or purchase from the Company or any other Person by any Person or
"group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of more than a
20% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially
owning 20% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company
or any merger, consolidation, business combination, arrangement or similar
transaction involving the Company pursuant to which the shareholders of the
Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 80% of the
equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (B)
any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice), acquisition or disposition
of more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including any shares of share capital, partnership interests or
similar ownership interests of the Companys Subsidiaries); or (C) any
liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other significant corporate
reorganization of the Company; and

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal to acquire all (but not less than all) of the outstanding

Section 5.7(a) which: (A) is not subject to any financing contingency (or
contains a reverse break-up fee payable, among other circumstances, in the
event of any failure to obtain any financing which effectively limits the
acquiring partys liability in the event that financing is not obtained), (B)
and with respect to which the board of directors of the Company shall have in
good faith determined (taking into account the advice of the Companys
financial advisors) that the acquiring party is reasonably capable of
consummating such proposed Acquisition Transaction on the terms proposed and
that receipt of all governmental and regulatory approvals required to
consummate such proposed Acquisition Transaction is likely in a reasonable
time period without significant condition or litigation; and (C) the board of
directors of the Company shall have in good faith determined (taking into
account the advice of the Companys financial advisors) that the proposed
Acquisition Transaction, taking into account all the terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal, is more favorable to the shareholders of the
Company, from a financial point of view (taking into account both long-term
and short-term considerations), than the Transactions (taking into account any
proposed modifications by the Parent in response thereto).

(b) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.7(a),
the Company as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 48 hours,
shall notify the Parent of: (i) any request for information in connection
with, or which the Company reasonably concludes would lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with
respect to or which the Company reasonably concludes would lead to any
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) the material terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry; and (iv) the identity of the Person or group
making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company
shall keep the Parent informed in all material respects of the status and
details (including material

 amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall: (i) provide the
Parent with at least 48 hours prior written notice (or such lesser prior
notice as provided to the members of the board of directors of the Company) of
any meeting of the board of directors of the Company at which the board of
directors of the Company is reasonably expected to consider an Acquisition
Proposal; and (ii) provide the Parent with at least five Business Days prior
written notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the members of the
board of directors of the Company) of any meeting of the board of directors
of the Company at which the board of directors of the Company is reasonably
expected to withdraw, amend, modify or change its recommendation in favor of
the approval of the Merger Proposal or recommend a Superior Proposal to its
shareholders, and together with such notice provide a copy of drafts of
definitive documentation relating to such Superior Proposal.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a),
Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange
Act or Section 329 of the Companies Law or any other applicable section of the
Companies Law with respect to a tender of exchange offer;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except as contemplated by Section 5.2(e), neither the
Company nor its board of directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw,
amend, modify, change or supplement, or publicly propose to withdraw, amend,
change or supplement, its position with respect to the Merger Proposal or
approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal. In addition, it is understood and agreed
that, for all purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public
statement by the Company that describes the Companys receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto,
or any "stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of Directors of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act or any other applicable
section of the Companies Law with respect to a tender of exchange offer, or
any similar communication to the shareholders of the Company, shall not
constitute a Triggering Event or a withdrawal, amendment, modification, change
or supplement, or a public proposal by the board of directors of the Company
to withdraw, amend, modify, change or supplement, its position with respect
to the Merger Proposal or an approval, endorsement or recommendation with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

 Section 5.8 _Public Disclosure_. The Parent and the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with each other before issuing, and
provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press
release or other public statements or employee communications with respect to
the Merger and the other Transactions, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement or issue such employee
communication prior to such consultation, except as either party may
determine is required by applicable Legal Requirements, the SEC or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national trading system (in which case reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party will be made prior to any such release or public
statement). Each of the Parent and the Company may make any public statement
in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long
as such statements are substantially similar to previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made by the Parent or the Company in
accordance with this Section 5.8. The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be a joint release
in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 Section 5.9 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Regulatory Filings_. Subject
to Section 5.10 and the last sentence of this Section 5.9, each of the parties
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other Transactions in the
most expeditious manner practicable, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) causing the conditions precedent set

of all commercially reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit,
claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and other Transactions; and
(iii) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the Transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company, the Parent and their respective boards of
directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of
the Transactions, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this
Agreement and the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, neither the Parent nor the Company shall have any

technology, software or other proprietary asset; (iv) to hold separate or
cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or operations
(either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit to cause the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or operations;
(v) subject to the undertakings required by Section 5.4, to make or cause any
of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment (to any Governmental Entity or
otherwise) regarding its future operations or the future operations of
the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that would affect its
discretion in determining the terms of any Contract or relationship with any
Person; or (vi) to contest or defend against any suits, claims, actions,
investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.

 Section 5.10 _Third Party Consents_. As soon as practicable following the
date hereof, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its Subsidiaries
respective Contracts required to be obtained in connection with the

 required to be set forth in Section 2.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter,

or make any commitment to incur any other material liability or
other obligation due to such Person.

 Section 5.11 _Share Options and Employee Benefits_.

(a) _Share Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Share
Option under the Company Option Plans or under any agreement disclosed in
Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter1, whether or not vested, shall by
virtue of the Transactions be assumed by the Parent. Each Company Share Option
so assumed by the Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions of such options immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions
and provisions regarding the acceleration of vesting on certain transactions),
except that: (i) each Company Share Option will be solely exercisable (or
will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company
Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Share Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
and; (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Share Option will be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per Company
Share at which such Company Share Option was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent, _provided_ that the adjustments pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii) shall be made after giving effect to the adjustments to the Company
Share Options contemplated by Section 5.12(b) below. The Parent shall comply
with the terms of all such Company Share Options and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the
provisions of, the applicable Company Option Plan and permitted under the
Code or other relevant Legal Requirements that any Company Share Options that
are intended to qualify for tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code prior
to the Effective Time and that any Company Share Options that are intended to
qualify for tax treatment under Section 102 of the Ordinance prior to the
Effective Time continue to so qualify, with the same rights, after the
Effective Time, subject to the terms of the Israeli Options Tax Ruling,
if obtained. The Parent shall take all corporate actions necessary to reserve
for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of all Company Share Options pursuant to the terms set forth in
this Section 5.11(a). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary (including making any required amendments and/or obtaining
any required consents) to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Section 5.11(a).2

(b)  _401(k) Plan_. The Company will adopt, or will cause to be adopted, all
necessary corporate resolutions to terminate each 401(k) Plan sponsored or
maintained by the

 Company, effective as of no later than one day prior to the Closing (but
such termination may be contingent upon the Closing). Immediately prior to
such termination, the Company will make all necessary payments to fund the
contributions: (i) necessary or required to maintain the tax-qualified status
of the 401(k) Plan; (ii) for elective deferrals made pursuant to the 401(k)
Plan for the period prior to termination; and (iii) for employer matching
contributions (if any) for the period prior to termination. For this purpose,
the term " _401(k) Plan_ " means any plan intended to be qualified under
Code Section 401(a) which includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to
qualify under Code Section 401(k). The Company shall provide the Parent with a
copy of resolutions duly adopted by the Companys board of directors
so terminating any such 401(k) Plan.

(c) The Parent intends that, for one year after the Effective Time, the Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to arrange for each
Employee who was participating in any of the Company Employee Plans
immediately before the Effective Time to participate in benefit plans (which
may be the Company Employee Plans) providing benefits (other than incentive
or equity compensation) that are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to
the benefits (other than incentive or equity compensation) provided under the
Company Employee Plans in which such Employees were participating before the
Effective Time (the " _Counterpart Plans_ "). To the extent applicable,
participants in such Counterpart Plans shall receive full credit for years of
service with any one or more of the Company, any of the Companys
Subsidiaries and prior employers to the extent such service is taken into
account under the Company Employee Plans and to the extent such service credit
does not result in the duplication of benefits. To the extent applicable,
the Parent and/or its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to give credit under those of its Counterpart Plans that are welfare benefit
plans for all amounts credited toward deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums,
and time accrued against applicable waiting periods, by Employees (in each
case including their eligible dependents), in respect of the applicable plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs. With respect to any changes in
medical plans, the Parent and/or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Company) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all requirements
for evidence of insurability, eligibility waiting periods and pre-existing
conditions otherwise applicable to Employees under the Counterpart Plans in
which Employees become eligible to participate on or following the Effective
Time (to the extent that such conditions were covered under the Company
Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time). Nothing in
this Section 5.11(c) shall be construed to entitle any Employee to continue
his or her employment for any period of time.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement (including this Section 5.11) shall:
(i) amend, or be deemed to amend, any Company Employee Plan; (ii) provide any
Person not a party to this Agreement with any right, benefit or remedy with
regard to any Company Employee Plan or a right to enforce any provision of
this Agreement; or (iii) limit in any way the ability of the Parent or the
Surviving Company to amend or terminate any particular Company Employee Plan
at any time.

 Section 5.12 _Cash Distribution_.

(a) The Company shall declare (subject to obtaining the Court Approval), and
immediately prior to the Effective Time the Company shall pay, a cash
distribution equal to $158,296,472 in the aggregate to all holders of record
of Company Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time pro rata in
accordance with their holdings of Company Shares (as the same may be adjusted
pursuant to Section 5.12(c), the " _Cash Distribution_ ", and the amount of
such distribution payable in respect of each Company Share as of the record
date shall be referred to as the " _Per Share Cash Distribution Amount_ ").
The Company shall apply to the Applicable Court to receive approval for a
capital reduction in order to enable the Cash Distribution together with and
as part of the application for the Court Approval, and the terms " _Merger
Proposal_ " and " _Court Approval_ " shall include, in addition to the
approval of the Merger, the approval of the Cash Distribution. The provision
of Sections 5.2(b) and 5.4 regarding the coordination and cooperation of the
Parent and the Company and the use of all reasonable efforts shall apply to
the obtaining of the approval of the court for the Cash Distribution. The
Company shall deduct and withhold from the Cash Distribution such amounts as
may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, the
Ordinance, or under any provision of state, local, Israeli or other foreign
law or any other applicable Legal Requirement. 

(b) In addition, prior to making the Cash Distribution, the Company shall take
all actions necessary (including making any required amendments and/or
obtaining any required consents) to provide that, upon the Cash Distribution,
each then-outstanding Company Share Option shall automatically be adjusted as
follows: (i) each such Company Share Option will be solely exercisable (or
will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole
Company Shares equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Share Option immediately prior to
the Cash Distribution multiplied by the Cash Distribution Adjustment Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of Company Shares and; (ii) the per
share exercise price for the Company Shares issuable upon exercise of such
Company Share Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per Company Share at which such Company Share Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Cash Distribution by the Cash
Distribution Adjustment Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. For
these purposes, the " _Cash Distribution Adjustment Ratio_ " shall be equal to
(x) (x) the closing sale price of one Company Share as reported on the Nasdaq
for the trading day immediately prior to the making of the Cash Distribution,
divided by (y) the difference of the closing sale price of one Company Share
as reported on the Nasdaq for the trading day immediately prior to the making
of the Cash Distribution less the Per Share Cash Distribution Amount.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Parent shall inform the
Company that it is necessary, in order to cause the representation and
warranty of the Parent and Merger Sub set forth in the third sentence of
Section 3.3 herein to be true and correct in all respects, to effect a
reduction in the Exchange Ratio, the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced by an
amount, not to exceed 0.0191, as may be determined by Parent to cause such
representation and warranty to be true and correct. In the event of any such
reduction to the Exchange Ratio, the Company shall increase the
Cash Distribution by an amount, not to exceed $5,006,083, by $26,209.86 for
every 0.0001 decrease in the Exchange Ratio.

seven years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Persons, unless such modification

Companys Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of October 2, 2000, as
amended, and the Companys Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated as of
September 2, 2000, as amended, effective as of and contingent upon the

immediately following the Effective Time. In the event the Merger does not

any other party to any such agreement or any other Person for any costs,
claims, liabilities or damages in connection with such terminations.

 Section 5.20 _Tax Treatment_. Each of the Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Neither
Parent, the Company nor any of their Subsidiaries, unless required by law,
will take any Tax reporting position inconsistent with the characterization of

intend that each provision of this Agreement shall be given full separate and
independent effect. Although the same or similar subject matters may be
addressed in different provisions of this Agreement, the parties intend that,
