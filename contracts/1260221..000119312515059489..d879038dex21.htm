access to the Books and Records, any other information (including the work
papers of its accountants) and to any management employees, to the
extent necessary for Sellers to review the Closing Statement. Buyer agrees
that following the Closing and prior to the determination of the Final Closing
Statement, it shall neither alter nor destroy any of the Books and Records on
which the Closing Statement is to be based.

(b) Sellers shall, within 30 days after the delivery by Buyer of the Closing
Statement (the " _Sellers  Review Period_"), complete its review of the Net
Working Capital, the Closing Cash Amount and any Business Indebtedness
reflected on the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement shall be binding and
conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Sellers unless Sellers shall have
notified Buyer in writing prior to the expiration of the Sellers Review
Period of any good faith objection thereto (the " _Sellers  Objection_"). The
Sellers Objection shall set forth a specific description of the basis of the
Sellers Objection and the specific adjustments to the Net Working Capital,
the Closing Cash Amount and/or Business Indebtedness reflected on the Closing
Statement which Sellers believe should be made. Any items not disputed in a
valid Sellers Objection shall be deemed to have been accepted by Sellers and
shall be final and binding.

 

(c) If Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve all of their disputes with
respect to the Closing Statement within 15 days following Buyers receipt of
Sellers Objection to such Closing Statement pursuant to Section 2.6(b), they
shall refer their remaining differences to the CPA Firm for decision, which
decision shall be final and binding on the parties upon delivery of the
written opinion set forth in sub-clause (iii) below. The procedure and
schedule under which any dispute shall be submitted to the CPA Firm shall be
as follows:

 

(i) Within 15 days following the expiration of the period referred to in
paragraph (c) above, Buyer or Sellers may submit any unresolved portion of
Sellers Objection to the CPA Firm in writing (with a copy to the other
party), supported by any documents and/or affidavits upon which it relies.

 

(ii) Within 15 days following submission of the unresolved portion of Sellers
Objection as specified in sub-clause (i) above, the other party shall submit
a response to the CPA Firm in writing (with a copy to the party that submitted
such unresolved portion to the CPA Firm), supported by any documents and/or
affidavits upon which they rely.

 



-7- (iii) Buyer and Sellers shall request that the CPA Firm deliver its
written opinion within 20 days following its receipt of the information
provided for in sub-clause (ii) above, or such longer period of time as the
CPA Firm determines is necessary, but not to exceed 30 days. The scope of the
disputes to be resolved by the CPA Firm is limited to the unresolved portion
of the Sellers Objection. In resolving any disputed items, the CPA Firm may
not assign a value to any particular item greater than the greatest value for
such item claimed by Buyer or Sellers or less than the smallest value for
such item claimed by Buyer or Sellers. Buyer and Sellers shall make readily
available to the CPA Firm all relevant Books and Records and any work papers
(including those of the parties respective accountants) relating to the
Closing Statement and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm.

Any expenses relating to the engagement of the CPA Firm shall be allocated
between Buyer and Sellers so that Sellers share of such costs shall be in the
same proportion that (x) the aggregate amount of the disputed items of
Sellers Objection submitted to the CPA Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed
bears to (y) the total amount of all disputed items of Sellers Objection
submitted to the CPA Firm. Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other,
shall each bear the fees of their respective auditors and advisors incurred
in connection with the determination and review of the Closing Statement.

(d) The Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the parties upon
the earliest of (i) if no Sellers Objection has been given, the expiration of
the period within which Sellers must make the Sellers Objection pursuant to
Section 2.6(b), (ii) agreement in writing by Sellers and Buyer that the
Closing Statement, together with any modifications thereto agreed by Sellers
and Buyer, shall be final and binding and (iii) the date on which the CPA Firm
shall issue its written determination with respect to any dispute relating to
such Closing Statement. The Closing Statement, as submitted by Buyer if no
timely Sellers Objection has been given or as adjusted pursuant to any
agreement between the parties or as determined pursuant to the decision of
the CPA Firm, is herein referred to as the " _Final Closing Statement_."

 

(e) Within five Business Days following the determination of the Final Closing
Statement, the adjustment payment payable pursuant to this Section 2.6(e)
(the " _Adjustment Payment_ ") and interest (as described below) thereon shall
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
designated by Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be. The Adjustment Payment
shall be equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Difference. For
purposes of this Agreement, the " _Post-Closing Difference_ " shall mean (i)
the Net Working Capital, as reflected on the Final Closing Statement, _minus_
the Working Capital Target, _plus_ (ii) the Closing Cash Amount, as reflected
on the Final Closing Statement, _minus_ the Estimated Closing Cash Amount,
_minus_ (iii) the amount of the Business Indebtedness reflected on the Final
Closing Statement, _minus_ the Estimated Business Indebtedness Amount. The
Adjustment Payment shall be payable by Buyer to Sellers if the Post-Closing
Difference is positive, and by Sellers to Buyer if the Post-Closing
Difference is negative. The Adjustment Payment shall bear interest from the
date on which the Final Closing Statement becomes final and binding to the
date of payment at the Closing Date Interest Rate, which interest shall
be calculated on the basis

 



-8-  of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and such interest
shall be paid on the same date and in the same manner as such Adjustment
Payment. Any adjustment or non-adjustment to the Purchase Price shall not
form the basis for any claim for damages pursuant to this Agreement. The
parties payment obligations under this Section 2.6 will not be subject to
offset or reduction by reason of any actual or alleged breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, and any right or alleged right of
indemnification hereunder or for any other reason or under any other
agreement.

 

Section 2.7 _Taxes and Fees_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, all sales, use, transfer, excise, ad valorem, value added,
stamp, conveyance, mortgage, intangible, documentary recording and other
similar taxes, license and registration fees, and recording fees, if any,
imposed by any Governmental Authority upon the transfer of the Shares or
the Telair U.S. Assets hereunder and the filing of any instruments (the "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers,
except that (A) any Transfer Taxes due to any German Governmental Authority,
and (B) any notarial fees out of or in connection with the notarization of
the transfer of the Shares (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Telair
Transfer Deed), in each case, shall be paid solely by German Buyer. Sellers,
Buyer and German Buyer shall cooperate with each other in any mutually
agreeable, reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to minimize any
applicable Transfer Taxes or notarial fees; including providing notice of the
transaction as contemplated by Section 2.7 of the Seller Disclosure Letter to
the applicable German Governmental Authorities within 14 days following the
date hereof.

 

Section 2.8 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be
allocated among Sellers in the manner set forth in Section 2.8 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter. Additionally, Sellers and Buyer agree that the Purchase
Price shall be further allocated among the Shares and the Telair U.S. Assets
sold by Sellers and Sellers covenant not to compete described in Section
5.11 on the basis of an allocation (the " _Allocation_ ") prepared
substantially consistent with Section 2.8 of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
except for any such changes that are required by changes in the Business or
the Telair U.S. Assets occurring between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing. The Allocation shall be prepared by Buyer for the review and approval
of Sellers, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or denied, within 20
Business Days after the date on which the Final Closing Statement is
determined. If within 30 days after delivery of the Allocation, Sellers notify
Buyer in writing that Sellers object to the allocation set forth in the
Allocation, Buyer and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve such dispute within 20 days thereafter. In the event that Buyer and
Sellers are unable to resolve such dispute within such 20 days, Buyer and
Sellers shall, within 10 days after such 20-day period, submit such disputed
items to the CPA Firm for resolution under the procedures set forth in Section
2.6(c). Buyer and Sellers shall make available to the CPA Firm, in connection
with the foregoing, all relevant work papers relating to the Allocation
calculation. The final version of the Allocation as determined in accordance
with the foregoing shall become part of this Agreement for all purposes.
Sellers and Buyer agree to report, pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder or any other similar provision under
Law, as and when required, the Allocation of the Purchase Price, as adjusted,
among the Shares, the Telair U.S. Assets and Sellers covenant not to compete
described in Section 5.11 in a manner entirely consistent with such
Allocation in the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns (including IRS
Form 8594). Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall take any position (whether in
audits, 

 



-9-  Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Allocation unless
required to do so by Law or by a final determination by the applicable
Governmental Authority.

necessary to authorize this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. At Closing, the Ancillary Agreements will be duly
authorized, executed and delivered by each Seller, as applicable, and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer or German Buyer,
as applicable, will constitute legal, valid and binding agreements of each
Seller, as applicable, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Principles.

Section 3.2 _No Conflict_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
each Ancillary Agreement to which any Seller is or will be a party, the

obligation or loss of a material benefit under any Significant Contract; or
(d) result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than a Permitted

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and except as contemplated by
this Agreement, since November 30, 2014 to the date of this Agreement, none
of Sellers, the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV has taken, or agreed or

Lease by the counterparties thereto and to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Principles. There is no material breach or default under any Real Property
Lease, and to Sellers Knowledge, no event has occurred that, with the passage
of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a material

 



-12-  breach or default by AAR Manufacturing, any Acquired Company or the Satair
JV or any other party thereto under any Real Property Lease.

 

(d) Sellers have made available to Buyer full, complete and accurate copies of
each Real Property Lease, together with all amendments and assignments of

respecting the Transferred Employees (with respect to AAR Manufacturing,
solely with respect to the Business), nor is there pending, or to
Sellers Knowledge, threatened, any material strike, walkout or other work
stoppage or any union organizing effort by or with respect to the Transferred
Employees. For the avoidance of a doubt, works agreements (
_Betriebsvereinbarungen_ ) entered into by Telair shall not be covered by
this Section 3.12.

Section 3.13 _Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) All material benefit plans, contracts or arrangements maintained for the
benefit of Transferred Employees, including "employee benefit plans" within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA and plans of deferred compensation, but
excluding the Foreign Plans (the " _Benefit Plans_ "), are listed in Section
3.13(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Summaries of the Benefit Plans have
been prepared by Sellers and made available to Buyer.

(b) Neither Sellers nor any other employer that is, together with Sellers,
treated as a "single employer" under section 414(b), 414(c) or 414(m) of the
Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "), has incurred any material liability
under Section 4062, 4063, 4064 or 4069 of ERISA that to Sellers Knowledge
could subject Buyer or any Business Asset to such liability. Neither Sellers
nor any ERISA Affiliate, while an ERISA Affiliate, has any currently
outstanding material withdrawal liability, within the meaning of Section 4201
of ERISA, to any multiemployer pension plan, which liability could reasonably
be expected to become a liability of Buyer, or to impose any material
Encumbrance.

 

(c) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination letter or can rely on an
opinion letter as to its qualified status, and each such Benefit Plan intended
to be so qualified remains qualified, has been timely amended to date and to
Sellers Knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist that reasonably would be
expected to result in disqualification of such Benefit Plan.

(d) All benefit plans, contracts or arrangements currently covering
Transferred Employees, which would be described in (a) above, but for the fact
that such plans are maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States
(but excluding plans maintained by a Governmental Authority), are listed in
Section 3.13(d) of the Seller

 



-17-  Disclosure Letter (the " _Foreign Plans_ "), and a true and complete copy of
each Foreign Plan (other than those required by Law) constituting part of the
Business Assets has been provided or made available to Buyer.

(e) Each of the Foreign Plans has obtained from the government or governments
having jurisdiction with respect to such plan any required determinations
that such plans are in material compliance with the laws and regulations of
any Governmental Authority. There are no pending or, to Sellers Knowledge,
threatened investigations by any Governmental Authority involving the Foreign
Plans. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to Sellers
Knowledge, threatened (except for claims for benefits payable in the normal
operation of the Foreign Plans) against any Foreign Plan or asserting any
rights or claims to benefits under any Foreign Plan, other than benefits
payable in the ordinary course of the operations of the Foreign Plans.

 

(f) Any nonqualified deferred compensation plans of AAR Manufacturing (with
respect to the Business), the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV or any
ERISA Affiliate comply in all material respects with ERISA and the Code,
including Section 409A of the Code, to the extent ERISA and the Code apply to
such plans and any payments under such deferred compensation plans to
an employee of any of the foregoing contemporaneous with, or following the
Closing Date will comply in all material respects with Section 409A of the
Code to the extent ERISA and the Code apply to such plans, and will not give
rise to any material taxes or penalties under Code Section 409A, and Buyer is
neither assuming nor being asked to assume any such deferred compensation plan
obligation to any Transferred Employee contemporaneous with or after the
Closing Date.

 

(g) Each Foreign Plan is operated in material compliance with all applicable
Laws.

 

(h) Other than as set forth in this Section 3.13, Sellers do not make any
other representations or warranties, either express or implied, with respect
to any matters relating to employee benefits or matters pertaining to any Law
relating thereto.

 

Section 3.14 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) Set forth in Section 3.14(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter is a list, as
of the date of this Agreement, of all patents, registered trademarks,
registered copyrights and all applications for the same, that are included in
the Business Assets (" _Registered IP_ "). Each material item of Registered IP
is valid and enforceable. No Acquired Company, the Satair JV or any Seller
has received any written non-infringement or invalidity opinion of counsel
regarding any infringement or invalidity relating to any Registered IP.

 

(b) Section 3.14(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter lists, as of the date of
this Agreement, all material licenses, sublicenses, consents and other
agreements (i) by which AAR Manufacturing, any Acquired Company or the Satair
JV is authorized to use any of the intellectual property (other than off-the-
shelf computer programs) that is included in 

 



-18-  the Business Assets, and (ii) by which AAR Manufacturing, any Acquired
Company or the Satair JV licenses or otherwise authorizes a third party to use
any material intellectual property owned by AAR Manufacturing, any Acquired
Company or the Satair JV and that is included in the Business Assets (the "
_IP Contracts_ "). To Sellers Knowledge, (a) each material IP Contract is
valid and is in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of such IP
Contract subject to authorization and execution of such IP Contract by the
counterparties thereto and to the Bankruptcy and Equity Principles and (b)
there is no material breach or default under any material IP Contract, and no
event has occurred that, with the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute a material breach or default by AAR Manufacturing, an
Acquired Company or the Satair JV or any other party thereto under
any material IP Contract. Sellers, the Acquired Companies and the Satair JV
have taken all reasonable and customary precautions to protect the proprietary
nature of, and maintain in confidence, all material intellectual property and
trade secrets that is included in the Business Assets.

(c) To Sellers Knowledge, the activities engaged in by the Business do
not infringe or otherwise violate any intellectual property rights of any
third party. No Seller, Acquired Company or the Satair JV has received any
written notice from any other Person challenging any right of AAR
Manufacturing, any Acquired Company or the Satair JV to use any of the
intellectual property listed in Schedule 3.14 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule that is material to the operation of the Business as currently
conducted and which remains outstanding. No Seller, Acquired Company or the
Satair JV has brought any pending claim that any Person is materially
violating or infringing upon the intellectual property listed in Schedule 3.14
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. To Sellers Knowledge, no Person has
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any material intellectual
property used in the Business. AAR Manufacturing, the Acquired Companies and
the Satair JV own all right, title and interest in and to, or have a license,
sublicense or permission to use, all of the material intellectual property
used in the Business, free and clear of all material Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances), and such intellectual property constitutes all
intellectual property necessary to conduct the Business in the manner
currently conducted.

(d) The representations and warranties contained in this Section 3.14 shall
be the exclusive representations and warranties with respect to the
infringement of third-party intellectual property and, notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, no other representation or
warranty is made in this Agreement with respect to the infringement of third-
party intellectual property.

Section 3.15 _Brokers and Finders_. Except for the retention of Citigroup
Global Markets Inc., the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Sellers in
accordance with Section 9.4, neither Sellers nor any of the Acquired Companies
or the Satair JV have employed any broker, finder or investment banker who
would have a valid claim for a fee or commission from Buyer, German Buyer or,
following Closing, any Acquired Company or the Satair JV, or incurred any
liability for any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission for which
Buyer, German Buyer or, following Closing, any Acquired Company or the Satair
JV would be liable, in each case in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

given with respect to an Acquired Company or the Satair JV and no request for
any such waiver or extension is pending with respect to an Acquired Company or
the Satair JV for any taxable years. None of the Acquired Companies or the

other Person as a result of successor liability, transferee liability or
contractual liability. Except for any ongoing audits conducted by a
Governmental Authority in the ordinary course pursuant to applicable Law,
there is no federal, state, local or foreign audit, examination, claim or
action pending against any Acquired Company or the Satair JV in respect of any
Tax, and to Sellers Knowledge, no such audit, examination claim or action has
been threatened or contemplated. Neither the Acquired Companies nor the
Satair JV have a request for a ruling or similar advice or a request for a
change of any method of accounting that is in progress or pending with any
Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes. No power of attorney granted by

and paid the amount of any Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in

purposes.

 

Section 3.18 _Related Party Transactions_. Neither Seller, nor to Sellers
Knowledge, any officer or director of either Seller is a party to any
Contract with any Seller (with respect to the Business), Acquired Company or
the Satair JV. To Sellers Knowledge, no director, officer or employee of the
Business has an interest in any Contract or other commitment of the Business
(excluding Contracts relating to such director, officer or employees
employment with the Business) or any Business Asset. Section 3.18 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth all Contracts or arrangements between any

transactions contemplated hereby. At Closing, the Ancillary Agreements will be
duly authorized, executed and delivered by Buyer or German Buyer, as the case
may be, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Sellers, as
applicable, will constitute legal, valid and binding agreements of Buyer or
German Buyer, as the case may be, enforceable in accordance with their terms,

breach of, or constitute a default (or event which with the giving of notice
or lapse of time, or both, would become a default) under, or give to others

material obligation of Buyer or German Buyer except in any such case for any
violations, breaches, defaults or other matters that would not prohibit or
materially impair Buyers or German Buyers ability to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements.

Section 4.3 _Consents and Approvals_. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Buyer and German Buyer do

such filing or notification, would not prevent or materially delay the
consummation by Buyer and German Buyer of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (d) as may be necessary as a
result of facts or circumstances relating solely to Sellers (as opposed to any
third party) and their participation in the transactions contemplated by this

investment decision with respect to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the purchase of the Shares.

 

Section 4.8 _Litigation_. There is no suit, investigation, action or other
proceeding pending or, to Buyers Knowledge, threatened before any court,

prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein.

 



-24- _ARTICLE V_

 

CERTAIN COVENANTS OF SELLERS AND BUYER

 

Section 5.1 _Access and Information_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing or earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1, and except as determined by
Sellers in good faith to be appropriate to ensure compliance with any
applicable Laws and subject to any applicable privileges (including the
attorney-client privilege), Sellers shall permit Buyer and its
representatives to have reasonable access, during regular business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, to (i) the offices, facilities, properties and
the financial, accounting and other books and records of Sellers and the
Acquired Companies relating to the Business ( _provided_ such access does not
permit "Phase II" or other environmental sampling, testing or investigations)
and (ii) the appropriate management personnel of Sellers and the
Acquired Companies. Without limiting the foregoing, Sellers shall furnish to
Buyer and its representatives such additional financial and operating data and
other information regarding the Business as Buyer may from time to time
reasonably request for purposes of conducting its due diligence review of the
Business, preparing to operate the Business following the Closing and in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. It
is understood that Sellers shall be under no obligation to grant Buyer or its
representatives any access if such access would, under the circumstances and
in the sole discretion of Sellers, unreasonably interfere with Sellers or
their respective Affiliates operations, activities or employees, or if such
access would, in the reasonable judgment of Sellers, violate applicable
antitrust or similar Laws. With respect to any Persons with which any Seller,
any Acquired Company or the Satair JV has a direct or indirect
contractual relationship, and any Governmental Authorities with jurisdiction
over or that regulates any Sellers, any Acquired Company the Satair JV or the
Business, Buyer shall not make any independent inquiry with respect to any
Seller, any Acquired Company, the Satair JV, or the Business without Sellers
prior written consent and, to the extent Sellers consent thereto, all such
inquiries shall be conducted by Sellers in response to a request by Buyer.

 

(b) All information provided or obtained pursuant to Section 5.1(a) shall be
held by Buyer in accordance with, and subject to the terms of, and shall
constitute "Evaluation Material" under, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
October 20, 2014, between TransDigm Group Incorporated and AAR CORP. (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The parties hereby agree that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate upon
the Closing; _provided_ that Sections 2 and 3 of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the Closing in accordance with the time periods set
forth in such Sections; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 3 of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall not apply to any Transferred Employee or any employee of any
Acquired Company or the Satair JV.

 



-25- (c) For two years after the Closing Date, Sellers will, and will cause
their respective Affiliates, agents and other representatives to, treat and
hold as strictly confidential, and refrain from using or disclosing, all of
the Confidential Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Agreement shall restrict the ability of Sellers or their Affiliates to use
Confidential Information (i) for internal business purposes, compliance with
public reporting obligations, or preparation of tax returns and other tax
planning purposes, or (ii) as necessary for Sellers and their Affiliates to
fulfill their obligations under the Transition Services Agreement. If either
Seller is requested or legally required to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Seller will notify Buyer promptly of the request or
requirement so that Buyer or its Affiliates may seek an appropriate protective
order or waive compliance with the provisions hereof. If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, such Seller is, on
the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to
any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt, such Seller may disclose the
Confidential Information to the tribunal, but such Seller shall use its
reasonable efforts to obtain, at Buyers or its Affiliates request and
expense, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be
disclosed as Buyer or its Affiliate designates. As used in this Section
5.1(c), the term " _Confidential Information_ " means any information
concerning the businesses and affairs of the Business that is not, as of the
date of this Agreement, already generally available to the public; _provided_
, _however_ , that the term "Confidential Information" does not include
information that (i) is or becomes available to Sellers or their respective
Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Business,
provided that such other source is not known to such Person after due inquiry
to be bound by a confidentiality obligation to the Business or is otherwise
known by Sellers or their respective Affiliates after due inquiry to be
prohibited from disclosing the information to Sellers or their respective
Affiliates, (ii) is or becomes generally available to the public (other than
as a result of a violation by Sellers or their respective Affiliates of
the provisions of this Agreement), or (iii) is independently developed by
Sellers or their respective Affiliates without use of or reference to any
Confidential Information or violation of the provisions of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 5.1(c), Sellers
obligations with respect to Confidential Information that is deemed a trade
secret under applicable Law shall survive for the period of time pursuant to
which such trade secrets are protected under such applicable Law (and shall
not expire automatically upon the second anniversary of the Closing Date).

Section 5.2  _Registrations, Filings and Consents_.

(a) _General Obligations_. Each of Buyer and Sellers shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, use their reasonable best

(ii) If such action is necessary to prevent (A) the commencement of any
proceeding in any forum or (B) the issuance of any order, decree, decision,
determination or judgment by any Governmental Authority that, in the case of
either (A) or (B), would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Buyer and Sellers will, prior to such commencement or issuance and on behalf
of Buyer or Sellers and such of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
as may be relevant in this regard, proffer their willingness to take, and
agree to take, such actions, and they will agree to promptly effect such
actions (and will enter into agreements with, and submit to orders of, the
relevant Governmental Authority) in each case 

 



-27-  as may be necessary to prevent such commencement or issuance; _provided_ ,
_however_ , notwithstanding anything contained herein, in no event will any
party hereto be required to (X) sell, license or otherwise dispose of, or
hold separate or agree to sell, license or otherwise dispose of, any entities,
assets or facilities of the Business or any entity, facility or asset of Buyer
or its Affiliates, (Y) terminate, amend or assign existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations or (Z) amend, assign or terminate existing
licenses or other agreements or enter into such new licenses or other
agreements.

 

(iii) In the event of any such commencement or issuance, Buyer and Sellers
shall each have the option, but not the obligation, to defend through
litigation any claim asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding by any
person, including any Governmental Authority, seeking to delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(iv) Buyer and Sellers shall each have the option, but not the obligation, to
contest the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any permanent,
preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision,
determination or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or
issued or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any
proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers shall each have the option, but not the
obligation, to take any steps to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend,
prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so as to permit
such consummation as soon as reasonably practicable.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Buyer, Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates shall be obligated to agree to any remedy not conditioned on the
consummation of the Closing.

 

(e) _Notice and Cooperation_. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
sharing of information, in connection with obtaining or making all
authorizations, consents, orders, approvals or filings that are or may become
necessary, proper or advisable to be obtained or made to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Buyer and Sellers shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, promptly
notify each other of any communication it receives from any Governmental
Authority and permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
communication by such party to any Governmental Authority and shall provide
each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications
between such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members 

 



-28-  of the staff of any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, in each case
to the extent relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement.
Each of Buyer and Sellers may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section 5.2 as "outside counsel only." Such competitively
sensitive material and the information contained therein shall be given only
to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient
unless express written permission is obtained in advance from Buyer
or Sellers, as the case may be, or its legal counsel. If practicable, neither
Sellers nor Buyer shall agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry
by such Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting.

(f) Sellers and Buyer shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain, prior to or on the Closing Date, the written consent of the landlord
pursuant to that certain Agreement, dated September 14, 2012, by and between
4841 Cromwell, LLC and AAR Manufacturing d/b/a/ AAR Cargo Systems, to the
assignment of the rights and obligations of such agreement to Buyer.

Agreement, set forth in Section 5.3 of the Seller Disclosure Letter or

Business or shall be construed to limit Sellers discretion to operate the
Business in the ordinary course, or shall give Buyer or German Buyer any
ownership rights to the Business Assets, before the Effective Time. Subject to
Section 2.2, each of Buyer and German Buyer acknowledges that Sellers, the
Acquired Companies and the Joint Ventures may transfer, by way of a dividend
or otherwise, the cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and other
financial instruments described in Section 2.2 as well as any Excluded Assets
out of the Business prior to Closing and, it is intended that to the extent
practicable, such items will be transferred out of the Business by way of
dividend or otherwise prior to Closing.

 

Section 5.4 _Post-Closing Obligations of the Business to Certain Employees_.

 

(a) Buyer shall initially continue the employment of, or offer comparable
positions to, those employees of AAR Manufacturing, an Acquired Company or
the Satair JV who are employed in connection with the Business on the Closing
Date (" _Business Employees_ ") (including those employees on leave of
absence, vacation or otherwise absent from work on the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , no Business Employee located in the U.S. who is on
short-term or long-term disability or workers compensation on the Closing
Date shall, to the extent legally permissible under applicable mandatory
law, be eligible to be or become a Transferred Employee until medically
cleared to return to work, and anyone absent from work beyond a total of six
months shall remain an employee of Sellers). Neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall be obligated, however, to continue to employ any Transferred
Employee for any specific period of time following the Closing, subject to
applicable Law. Those Business Employees of AAR Manufacturing who accept the
offer of employment from Buyer, and those who are employees as of the Closing
Date of an Acquired Company or the Satair JV shall be referred to as "
_Transferred Employees_." Buyer shall maintain for the Transferred Employees
following the Closing Date and until December 31, 2015 (i) employee
compensation levels (excluding for purposes of compensation measurement any
equity compensation or direct stock purchase program) no less favorable than
those

 



-31-  provided immediately prior to the date hereof and (ii) benefit plans,
programs and policies (including retirement, medical, life insurance and
disability plans, programs and policies) and fringe benefits that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided immediately prior to
the date hereof (as described in the summary information made available
pursuant to Section 3.13(a)). All Transferred Employees shall (1) be given
credit for all service with AAR Manufacturing, an Acquired Company or the
Satair JV (or service credited by AAR Manufacturing, an Acquired Company or
the Satair JV under such employee benefit plans, programs and policies and
fringe benefits of the Business as in effect on the date of this Agreement)
under all employee benefit plans, programs and policies and fringe benefits of
the Business or Buyer in which they become participants for purposes of
eligibility, participation and vesting to the same extent such service was
credited under comparable plans, programs and policies of such Seller or
Acquired Company and (2) if any of the benefit plans are terminated prior to
the end of the plan year that includes the Closing Date, be credited with any
expenses that were covered by the plans for purposes of determining
deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under any similar replacement
plans, subject to applicable Law, and the Transferred Employees selecting and
being eligible for reasonably comparable plans as offered by Buyer. The
parties agree that any liabilities that may arise as a result of Buyers
failure to fulfill its obligations under this Section 5.4, including Buyers
failure to continue the employment of or offer employment to the Transferred
Employees as set forth in Section 5.4(a), shall be deemed to be Assumed
Liabilities.

 

(i) Sellers and Buyer agree that the transactions contemplated hereby shall
not constitute a severance of employment of any Transferred Employee prior to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that such
employees will have continuous and uninterrupted employment before and
immediately after the Effective Time. Except as required by Law or
as otherwise agreed in writing by Sellers and Buyer, Buyer shall provide
severance and other separation benefits to each Transferred Employee
terminated by Buyer following the Closing Date similar to the severance and
other separation benefits that Buyer provides its employees of comparable
positions and levels of employment. Buyer shall recognize service with AAR
Manufacturing, an Acquired Company or the Satair JV, as applicable, prior to
the Closing Date for purposes of determining the amount of such severance or
other separation benefits. Buyer shall indemnify and hold Sellers and their
respective Affiliates harmless from any claims made by any Transferred
Employee for severance or other separation benefits, from any claims based on
breach of contract and from any other claims arising out of, or in connection
with the employment or the failure to offer employment to, or the termination
of employment of, any Transferred Employee.

 

(ii) Buyer agrees that, with respect to all Transferred Employees, Buyer will
(1) honor all accrued but untaken vacation credited to such Transferred
Employees under the applicable vacation plans of Sellers and the Acquired
Companies, determined as of the Effective Time, and (2) provide that, with
respect to each Transferred Employee, the rate of accrual of hours of
vacation or other paid-time-off for employment with Buyer or its Affiliates
after the Effective Time shall not be less than such rate of accrual with AAR
Manufacturing or the

 



-32-  Acquired Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, through December
31, 2015.

 

(iii) Buyer agrees to reimburse Transferred Employees for educational expenses
incurred prior to the Effective Time but becoming reimbursable under the
terms of Sellers educational assistance plans after the Effective Time to the
same extent that those Transferred Employees would have been reimbursed under
Sellers educational assistance plans if they had remained employees of
Sellers or their respective Affiliates. Sellers will provide Buyer with
reasonable access to, and copies of, Sellers records necessary to provide the
foregoing benefits.

 

(b) _Seller Plans_. Effective as of the Effective Time, all Transferred
Employees who immediately prior to the Effective Time were active
participants in the Benefit Plans of any Seller or its Affiliates (including
AAR CORP.) (hereinafter referred to collectively as the " _Seller Benefit
Plans_ ") shall cease to be eligible for active participation in such Seller
Benefit Plans, subject to such Transferred Employees remaining eligible under
Seller Benefit Plans for up to ninety (90) days following the Closing Date in
accordance with the Transition Services Agreement. The benefits of
such Transferred Employees under the Seller Benefit Plans accrued prior to
the Effective Time, shall be provided to the Transferred Employees in
accordance with the terms of such plans, except to the extent otherwise
provided in this Section 5.4, including in respect of Sellers Savings Plan.

(c) _COBRA_. Sellers shall retain responsibility for providing employees of
AAR Manufacturing, the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV who were employed
in connection with the Business, who terminated employment prior to or at the
Closing Date and who elected group health coverage required by Section
4980B of the Code (" _Continuation Coverage_ ") under the terms of the health
plan maintained by AAR Manufacturing, such Acquired Company or the Satair JV
with such Continuation Coverage. Effective after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Business to provide Continuation Coverage,
including making such coverage available to the Transferred Employees after
the Closing Date upon their termination of employment with the Business or
Buyer to the extent required by Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , only
Transferred Employees who become COBRA eligible during the applicable period
of the Transition Services Agreement shall remain the responsibility of
Sellers applicable welfare plans through the applicable period of the
Transition Services Agreement, and Buyer shall offer only affected Transferred
Employees applicable COBRA coverage under Buyer welfare plans at the
conclusion of such period.

 

(d) _Welfare Plan_. Sellers shall retain liability for all medical, dental and
health claims incurred by Transferred Employees (and their dependents) under
Sellers respective employee welfare benefit plans prior to the Effective
Time. Buyer shall be liable for all medical, dental and health claims of
Transferred Employees (and their dependents) under the employee welfare
benefit plans of Buyer incurred at or after the Effective Time. For purposes
of this paragraph, a claim shall be deemed to have been incurred on the date
on which the medical or other treatment or service was rendered and 

 



-33-  not the date of the inception of the related illness or injury or the date
of submission of a claim related thereto.

 

(e) _Cafeteria Plan_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer shall (or
shall cause the Business to) establish or amend a cafeteria plan (" _Buyer s
Cafeteria Plan_") described under section 125 of the Code for the Transferred
Employees who were eligible to participate in such a plan sponsored by AAR
CORP. (" _Sellers  Cafeteria Plan_"). Buyers Cafeteria Plan shall include
medical expense reimbursement accounts and dependent care assistance accounts
(described under sections 105, 125 or 129 of the Code) (the " _Flex Accounts_
") as provided in Sellers Cafeteria Plan. As soon as administratively
feasible after the Closing, Sellers shall cause AAR CORP. to transfer to
Buyers Cafeteria Plans the account balance of any Flex Accounts maintained by
Transferred Employees who participate in Buyers Cafeteria Plan and maintain
such Flex Accounts; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the claims made against a
Transferred Employees Flex Accounts prior to his termination of employment by
AAR Manufacturing exceeds the amounts in such account at the Effective Time,
Buyer shall reimburse AAR Manufacturing the amount by which such claims exceed
the amounts in such Flex Accounts.

 

(f) If a Transferred Employee becomes eligible to participate in a medical,
dental or health plan of Buyer (or its Affiliates), Buyer shall cause such
plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations for conditions covered
under the applicable medical, dental or health plans of AAR CORP. and (ii)
credit any complete or partial satisfaction of any deductible and out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Transferred Employee and his dependents under
the applicable medical, dental or health plans of AAR CORP. during the portion
of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs. If a Transferred
Employee becomes eligible to participate in a group term life insurance plan
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates, Buyer shall cause such plan to waive
any medical certification for such Transferred Employee up to the amount of
coverage the Transferred Employee had under the life insurance plan of AAR
CORP.

(g) _U.S. Savings Plan Account Transfer_. Transferred Employees will cease
making contributions to AAR CORP.s 401(k) Plan, qualified under Code Sections
401(a) and 401(k) (" _Sellers  Savings Plan_") immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer will designate an
existing savings plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) and including a cash
or deferred feature under Code Section 401(k) and a related trust thereunder
which shall be exempt under Code Section 501(a) (" _Buyer s Savings Plan_")
that will permit participation by all Transferred Employees who are
participating in Sellers Savings Plan as of the Closing Date (the "
_Participating Employees_ "), within 90 days of the Closing Date. Buyers
Savings Plan shall permit rollovers and direct trust-to-trust transfers of the
Participating Employees accounts (including notes evidencing loans) in
Sellers Savings Plan. Buyers Savings Plan shall grant the Participating
Employees credit for service with AAR Manufacturing (and any other entity to
the extent credit has heretofore been granted by Sellers Savings Plan) to the
same extent as such service would be credited had it been performed for
Buyer, so that the Participating Employees shall receive credit for service
with AAR Manufacturing

 



-34-  (and any other entity to the extent credit has heretofore been granted by
Sellers Savings Plan) for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting.

 

(h) _Foreign Benefit Plans_.

 

(i) Buyer will, with respect to any Transferred Employees employed outside the
United States in connection with the Business on the Closing Date, in
addition to satisfying the employment requirements of Section 5.4, adopt or
designate employee benefit plans that will provide benefits, including
retirement, health and welfare benefits, to such non-U.S.
Transferred Employees that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
employee benefit plans maintained or contributed to for such non-U.S.
Transferred Employees by AAR Manufacturing, an Acquired Company or the Satair
JV.

 

(ii) Buyer will either assume any separate employee benefit plans covering
Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries, or designate existing employee
benefit plans maintained by Buyer, into which the assets and liabilities
attributable to the Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries will be
transferred as soon as practicable after Closing, and after any
necessary approvals by any Governmental Authority have been obtained or, if
no such approvals are required, after Sellers have received evidence from
Buyer, reasonably satisfactory to Sellers, that the employee benefit plans
adopted or designated by Buyer satisfy all material requirements of Law.

(iii) At the Effective Time, Buyer and Buyers employee benefit plans
shall be solely responsible for retirement, health and welfare benefits to
Transferred Employees, whether accrued before, at or after the Effective Time,
and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller Parties, including any Sellers
employee benefit plans, from any claims by or through any Transferred
Employee, or by any Governmental Authority, with respect to any such benefits.

 

(i) _Incentive Plans_. Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies and the Satair
JV to assume all obligations of Sellers and their respective Affiliates
(excluding the Acquired Companies and the Satair JV) to pay any short-term or
annual incentive or bonus amounts, commissions and similar amounts ("
_Bonuses_ "), other than any equity incentives, in respect of the fiscal year
in which the Closing occurs, but only to the extent accrued on the Final
Closing Statement. Buyer shall pay to the Transferred Employees, as a group,
an amount equal to no less than the amount accrued on the Closing Statement
in respect of such Bonuses for the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs,
with such payment to be made no later than 2.5 months following the end of
such fiscal year. Subject to Section 5.4(a), any incentive plans continued or
established following the Closing Date shall be those incentive plans
determined by Buyer.

(j) _Employee Access_. After the Closing, Buyer will permit Sellers (and
their respective Affiliates) to have access to Transferred Employees that such
Seller (or such Affiliate of a Seller) may reasonably need in order to defend
or prosecute any legal or administrative action to which such Seller (or such
Affiliate of a Seller) is a party and

 



-35-  which relates to the conduct of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing.
After the Closing, Buyer will cooperate with Sellers (and their respective
Affiliates) in providing access to relevant data and employment records of
Transferred Employees reasonably necessary to administer the benefits of
Transferred Employees under any Benefit Plan. Prior to the Closing, subject to
the approval of Sellers (not to be unreasonably withheld or denied), Sellers
will permit Buyer reasonable access to the Business Employees and related
employment and benefits information and materials for the purpose of
expediting the transition of Transferred Employees to Buyers employee
benefit plans.

(k) _No Conflict_. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing in this Section 5.4,
neither Buyer nor Sellers shall take any action to reduce, eliminate or
otherwise avoid obligations to Transferred Employees under existing collective
bargaining agreements, employment contracts or Law in the jurisdiction of
employment.

 

(l) _General_. This Section 5.4 shall survive the Closing and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Buyer and its Affiliates. Nothing set forth
in this Section 5.4 shall confer any rights or remedies upon any employee or
former employee of any Acquired Company, any Transferred Employee or upon any
other Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns or shall constitute an amendment to any Benefit Plan, Foreign Plan
or any other plan or arrangement covering the Transferred Employees or
employees of Sellers. Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall obligate Buyer to
continue the employment of any Transferred Employee for any specific period.

Section 5.5 _Books and Records_. For a period of five years after the Closing
Date, (a) Buyer agrees to, or cause the Business to, retain all Books and
Records and to make the same available after the Closing Date for inspection
and copying by Sellers or their respective agents at Sellers expense, upon
reasonable request and upon reasonable notice and (b) no such Books and
Records shall be destroyed by Buyer without first advising Sellers in writing
and giving Sellers a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof.

Section 5.6 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement grants
or shall be deemed to grant to Buyer the right to use, other than in
accordance with this Section 5.6, or any interest in (i) the names "AAR", "AAR
CORP.", "AAR Manufacturing, Inc.", "AAR International, Inc." or any trademark,
trade name, service mark, corporate name, domain name, logo or other source
indicator containing same and/or confusingly similar thereto (collectively,
the " _Seller Trademarks_ ") or (ii) any other intellectual property of
Sellers and their Affiliates that is not included in the Business Assets.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies and Joint Ventures) shall be permitted to (i) use any signs
or stationery, purchase order forms, packaging or other goods or supplies,
advertising and promotional materials, product, training and
service literature and materials, documentation, or any other materials in
any format or medium (" _Supplies_ ") that contain

 



-36-  any Seller Trademarks for a period of 180 days after the Closing Date and
(ii) may continue to distribute products that are in the possession of any
Acquired Company or Joint Venture as of the Closing or that any Acquired
Company or Joint Venture produces within 90 days after the Closing Date that
include or display the Seller Trademarks (including as a result of the use of
a mold or die used by any Acquired Company or Joint Venture in which Seller
Trademarks are embedded); _provided_ , _however_ , that if, in connection with
any change to, or discontinuance of, the use of any of the Seller Trademarks
in connection with any particular products or other materials of any Acquired
Company or Joint Venture, the approval of a Governmental Authority is required
or any customer Contract requires the approval of the applicable customer,
then Buyer and its Affiliates may continue to use the Seller Trademarks in
connection with such products or other materials until such approval is
obtained. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its
Affiliates to use their respective reasonable best efforts, to promptly obtain
such approvals. During the time period that Buyer or its Affiliates are using
the Seller Trademarks in accordance with the foregoing clause (ii), Buyer
shall provide periodic written updates no less frequently than once per month
to Sellers regarding the use of the Seller Trademarks and the status of the
transition away from the usage of such Seller Trademarks. In addition, Buyer
and its Affiliates will have no obligation to modify or update any products
distributed prior to the Closing Date to remove or prevent the continued
inclusion or display of the Seller Trademarks. After the Closing Date Buyer
shall not reorder, produce or reproduce any Supplies that include the Seller
Trademarks. After the Closing Date, Sellers grant to Buyer and the Acquired
Companies a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use
the Seller Trademarks for the periods and in accordance with the terms set
forth in this Section 5.6, solely in a high-quality manner that is consistent
with past practice. All goodwill associated with the use of the Seller
Trademarks shall inure to the benefit of Sellers, all other rights in the
Seller Trademarks are reserved to Seller, and nothing herein grants Buyer or
any of its Affiliates any right or license to use any other intellectual
property owned by Sellers.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies and Joint Ventures) shall have
the right, at all times after the Closing Date, to (i) retain and use (solely
for internal business purposes) records and other documents and
materials containing or referencing the Seller Trademarks as such records,
documents and materials exist as of the Closing Date, and (ii) use the Seller
Trademarks to refer to the historical fact that the Business was previously
conducted under the Seller Trademarks.

Section 5.7 _Further Assurances; Cooperation_. At any time after the date of
this Agreement, Sellers and Buyer shall promptly execute, acknowledge and
deliver any other assurances or documents or take any other actions reasonably
requested by Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, and necessary for Buyer or
Sellers, as the case may be, to satisfy its obligations hereunder and carry
out the purposes hereof. Sellers and Buyer shall each use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions to their respective
obligations set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied at or prior to Closing,
including (subject to Section 5.2) any filings with any Governmental Authority
required as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Accordingly, if at any time following the Closing Date it is discovered that
(i)

 



-37-  Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates has ownership of any Telair
U.S. Assets that were not transferred pursuant hereto, Sellers, at their sole
cost and expense, shall or shall cause such entity to transfer such Telair
U.S. Asset to Buyer and (ii) Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) has ownership of any Excluded Assets, Buyer, at Sellers
cost and expense, shall or shall cause such entity to transfer such Excluded
Assets to Sellers or their designee.

Section 5.8 _Compliance with WARN_. With respect to the
Transferred Employees, Buyer will timely give all notices required to be
given under, and will otherwise comply with, WARN and other similar Laws of
any jurisdiction relating to any plant closing or mass layoff or as otherwise
required by such Laws. For this purpose, Buyer shall be deemed to have caused
a plant closing or mass layoff if the plant closing or mass layoff would not
have occurred but for Buyers failure to employ the Transferred Employees in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Buyer shall indemnify and hold
Sellers harmless from all losses, claims and liabilities arising out of any
real or alleged violation of WARN or any similar Law based on Buyers failure
to offer employment to, hire or retain any Transferred Employees.

Section 5.9 _Foreign Implementing Agreements_. If, after the date of this
Agreement, Sellers and Buyer mutually agree or deem it advisable, or if
otherwise necessary to commemorate the transactions contemplated hereby,
Sellers and Buyer shall cause to be prepared and, prior to or on the Closing
Date, executed by the applicable parties, any additional agreements or
instruments implementing the transfer and conveyance to Buyer at the Effective
Time of the Shares or the Telair U.S. Assets and the assumption by Buyer of
the Assumed Liabilities (the "Foreign Implementing Agreements"). The parties
agree that any Foreign Implementing Agreements shall not expand or limit the
rights and obligations of Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, beyond those provided for in this Agreement, and that the Foreign
Implementing Agreements shall not provide for any additional rights or
obligations of Sellers or Buyer that are not provided for in this Agreement.
The parties shall cooperate in the preparation of any such Foreign
Implementing Agreements, which shall be prepared in a form suitable for use
by the parties in such foreign jurisdiction. In the event of any conflict
between the terms of any such Foreign Implementing Agreements and this

OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER WHATSOEVER REGARDING THE HABITABILITY,
MERCHANTABILITY, MARKETABILITY, OR PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS ASSETS.

Section 5.11 _Covenant Not to Compete_.

 

(a) Sellers agree that during the Restricted Period, neither Sellers nor any
of their Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, engage, manage, operate,
control, finance or have any ownership interest in any firm, corporation,
partnership, proprietorship or other Person that engages in, manages or
operates a business that competes with the Business (each, a " _Competing
Business_ ") anywhere in the world; _provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not
be a violation of this Section 5.11(a) for Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates (i) to own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment,
securities of any Person that are traded on a national securities exchange or
the Nasdaq Stock Market (or a recognized securities exchange outside the U.S.)
if Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (x) are not controlling
Persons or members of a group that controls such Person and (y) do not,
directly or indirectly, own more than 5% or more of the voting securities of
such Person, (ii) to acquire after the Closing, directly or indirectly,
the equity or assets of, or otherwise become affiliated with or participate
in, any enterprise that derives less than 25% of its total annual revenue from
a Competing Business, if Sellers divest, or signs a definitive agreement to
divest (and subsequently divests), as soon as reasonably practicable (and in
any event within 18 months after the closing date of such acquisition), its
interest in such enterprise relating to the Competing Business, (iii) to
continue operating any of the Excluded Assets or any existing lines of
business of AAR CORP. or its Affiliates other than the Business, including the
operation of the pallet, shelter and container business by AAR Manufacturing,
or (iv) to perform the activities contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements.
None of the provisions of this Section 5.11(a) shall operate to prohibit,
hinder, impede or restrict from engaging in a Competing Business in any way,
any Person which by way of takeover, acquisition, merger, combination or
similar transaction acquires a controlling or significant interest in any
Seller or any of its Affiliates ( _provided_ that such Seller and its
Affiliates as of the date of such transactions shall continue to be subject to
the provisions of this Section 5.11(a) after any such transaction). For
purposes of this Section 5.11, the term "Affiliate" shall not include any
Persons that are individuals.

 

(b) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending 18 months after
the Closing Date, Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to,
solicit, recruit for hire or hire any senior management, technical, sales,
marketing or engineering Transferred Employee other than through general
advertising, search firms, employment agencies or general solicitations not
specifically targeted at any employees of the Business; _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any Seller or its Affiliates
from soliciting or recruiting for hire any such employee whose employment
with Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) has
terminated, which termination was not induced, directly or indirectly, by
Sellers.

 



-39- (c) The " _Restricted Period_ " shall mean the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the earlier of (i) the four-year anniversary of the
Closing Date and (ii) the date Buyer and its Affiliates cease to engage in the
Business.

 

(d) If any provision contained in this Section 5.11 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section, but this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention
of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained in this
Section 5.11 is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time
which is not permitted by Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or
to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void
and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or
enforceable under Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and
interpret or reform this Section 5.11 to provide for a covenant having the
maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not
greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under
such Law.

 

Section 5.12 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Sellers
with the provisions of any so-called bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction
in connection with the sale to Buyer of the Telair U.S. Assets.

Section 5.13 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed with respect to the Acquired Companies and the
Satair JV for taxable periods ending prior to or on the Closing Date (all such
Tax Returns are referred to as the " _Prior Period Returns_ "). The Prior
Period Returns shall be prepared, where relevant, in a manner consistent with
the Sellers past practices, except as otherwise required by Law. Buyer shall
deliver to Sellers, for their review and comment, a draft of each Prior Period
Return at least 20 days prior to the applicable filing deadline of such Prior
Period Return (or to the extent such 20 day period would begin prior to
Closing, promptly following Closing). Within 10 days following receipt
thereof, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer written notice of any objection with
respect to the calculation of Taxes on such Prior Period Return. If Buyer and
Sellers are unable to resolve any disputes with respect to such calculations
within 10 days following delivery of Sellers notice of objection, such
dispute shall be submitted to the CPA Firm for resolution, which resolution
shall be final and binding upon the parties. Buyer shall make available to
Sellers (and to Sellers accountants and attorneys) any and all books and
records and other documents and information in its possession or control
relating to the Acquired Companies and the Satair JV reasonably requested by
Sellers to review the Prior Period Returns.

 

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed with respect to the Acquired Companies and the
Satair JV for taxable periods ending after the Closing Date and shall pay all
Taxes related thereto. Buyer shall prepare all Straddle Period Tax Returns in
a manner consistent with Sellers past practices, except as otherwise
required by Law. Buyer shall deliver to Sellers, for their review

 



-40-  and comment, a draft of each Straddle Period Tax Return at least 30 days
prior to the applicable filing deadline of such Straddle Period Tax Return,
together with a proposed calculation of the Taxes allocable to the Pre-
Closing Period. Within 15 days following receipt thereof, Sellers shall
deliver to Buyer written notice of any objection with respect to the
calculation of Taxes allocable to a Pre-Closing Period. If Buyer and Sellers
are unable to resolve any disputes with respect to such calculations within
10 days following delivery of Sellers notice of objection, such dispute shall
be submitted to the CPA Firm for resolution, which resolution shall be final
and binding upon the parties. The following conventions shall apply for
purposes of determining the portion of any Taxes due with respect to any
Straddle Period that is allocable to the Pre-Closing Period: (A) in the case
of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, the
amount attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of calendar days in the entire period; and (B) in the case of
all other Taxes (including Income Taxes, employment Taxes, and sales and
use Taxes) the amount attributable to the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined as if the Company filed a separate Tax Return
with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the period ending as of the end
of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology."
For purposes of clause (B), any item determined on an annual or periodic basis
(including amortization and depreciation deductions and the effects of
graduated rates) shall be allocated to the portion of the period ending on
the Closing Date based on the relative number of days in such portion of the
period as compared to the number of days in the entire period.

 

(c) Following the Closing, Sellers shall indemnify and hold Buyer and the
Acquired Companies harmless from and against (i) any Taxes of the Acquired
Companies (and seventy and one-half percent (70.5%) of any Taxes of the Satair
JV), in each case, for any taxable period (or portion of any Straddle Period)
ending on or prior to the Closing Date (including but not limited to Taxes
due with respect to the Prior Period Returns of the Acquired Companies (and
seventy and one-half percent (70.5%) of the Taxes shown on the Satair JV Prior
Period Returns) and the portion of Taxes attributable to the period prior to
Closing due with respect to Straddle Period Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies (and seventy and one-half percent (70.5%) of the portion of Taxes
attributable to the period prior to Closing due with respect on the Satair
JV Straddle Period Tax Returns)), and (ii) any Taxes of any other person for
which any of the Acquired Companies may become liable pursuant to Treas. Reg.
section 1.1502-6 (or analogous provisions of foreign, state or local law) as a
result of being a member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group of
corporations prior to the Closing Date (and seventy and one-half percent
(70.5%) of any such Taxes for which the Satair JV may become liable);
provided, however, that Sellers shall not be liable for or pay, and shall not
indemnify Buyer and/or the Acquired Companies for any Taxes to the extent (A)
such Taxes are reflected in the Final Closing Statement or (B) such Taxes are
the responsibility of Buyer pursuant to Section 5.13(f). As soon as
practicable after any payment of Taxes by Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any
of their Affiliates to a Governmental Authority for which Sellers have
indemnified a Buyer Party pursuant to Section 5.13 or Section 8.2, Buyer
shall (or shall cause the applicable Acquired Company or Affiliate to) deliver
to the Sellers the original or a certified copy of a receipt, if any, issued
by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment.

 



-41- (d) Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers following receipt of any notice of
audit or other proceeding relating to any matter for which Sellers may be
required to indemnify Buyer and/or the Acquired Companies pursuant to this
Agreement. Each party shall have the right to conduct and control in its sole
and absolute discretion any audit or other proceeding with any Tax authority
relating to any Tax Returns (i) it has the responsibility to file pursuant to
this Section 5.13, or (ii) it has the responsibility to file on or prior to
the Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) Sellers shall consult with
Buyer on the handling of any audit or other action, suit or proceeding
involving any Tax Return Sellers have the responsibility to file and, if such
audit or other proceeding would be reasonably expected to result in an
increase in Tax Liability of Buyer, or any of the Acquired Companies or Joint
Ventures for a post-Closing period, or in any Liability for which Buyer has
agreed to indemnify Sellers, Sellers shall not settle any such audit or
dispute without the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (ii) Buyer (and the applicable Acquired
Company) shall consult with Sellers on the handling of any action, suit or
proceeding involving a Tax Return that Buyer has the responsibility to file
and, if such action, suit or proceeding would be reasonably expected to result
in an increase in Tax Liability of Sellers or in any Liability for which
Sellers have agreed to indemnify Buyer and/or the Acquired Companies,
Sellers, at their sole expense, shall have the right to participate in such
action, suit or proceeding, and Buyer (and the applicable Acquired Company)
shall not settle any such action, suit or proceeding without the consent of
Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(e) Any Tax Refunds that are received by any of the Acquired Companies or the
Satair JV shall be for the account of Sellers and shall be forwarded by Buyer
to Sellers within seven (7) days after the Tax Refund is received; provided
that (A) such amounts shall be net of (1) any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred in obtaining such refund of Taxes, (2) any Tax required by Law to be
withheld on such payment, and (3) any Taxes borne by Buyer, any of the
Acquired Companies or Joint Ventures as a result of its receipt of such Tax
Refund, and (B) Sellers shall not be entitled to any Tax Refund attributable
to the carryback of a Tax credit or net operating loss arising in a taxable
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. If there is a
subsequent reduction by a Governmental Authority (or by virtue of a change in
applicable Tax Law), of any amounts with respect to which a payment has been
made to Sellers pursuant to this Section 5.13(e), then Sellers shall pay
Buyer an amount equal to such reduction plus any interest or penalties imposed
by a Governmental Authority with respect to such reduction, but in no case
more than the amount received by Sellers pursuant to this Section 5.13(e).

 

(f) Buyer shall pay and indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Parties from
and against any Taxes of Sellers and or their respective Affiliates resulting
from (i) any actions taken, or caused to be taken, by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates following the Closing (other than any transactions pursuant to this
Agreement and transaction entered into in the ordinary course), or (ii) any
Tax elections that Buyer or any of its Affiliates make or cause to be made
with respect to any of the Acquired Companies or the Satair JV following the
Closing.

 

(g) Buyer shall not amend, and shall not allow any of the Acquired Companies
or Joint Ventures to amend, any Tax Returns for any taxable period ending on
or

 



-42-  prior to the Closing Date or Straddle Period Tax Return of any of the
Acquired Companies or Joint Ventures, except (i) with the consent of Sellers,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed or (ii) as
required by applicable Law, but, in the case of this sub-paragraph (ii), only
if Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company or Joint Venture provide notice to
Sellers, no later than thirty (30) days prior to the filing of such
amendment, which details (A) the statutory, regulatory or other legal basis
which requires an amendment to such Tax Return and (B) the applicable Law
which is the basis for the required amendment to such Tax Return. If Sellers
provide notice that they dispute an amendment proposed to be made pursuant to
Section 5.13(g), Buyer shall not file such amendment until such dispute is
resolved, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Except as otherwise
required by Law, Buyer shall not, and shall not allow any of the Acquired
Companies or Joint Ventures to, carryback into any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, any Tax credit, net operating
loss, or other tax attribute or benefit arising in a taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

(h) Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, shall provide each
other with such cooperation and information as may be reasonably requested of
the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or
participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes. Each Seller and Buyer shall make themselves (and their respective
employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided hereunder. Each Seller
and Buyer agree that the Books and Records delivered to the control of Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement to the extent they relate to the operations of any
of the Acquired Companies or the Joint Ventures prior to the Closing Date,
remain in existence and available, Sellers (at their expense) shall have the
right upon prior notice to inspect and to make copies of the same at any time
during business hours for any proper purpose. Buyer shall use reasonable
efforts not to destroy or allow the destruction of any such Books and Records
without first offering in writing to deliver them to Sellers.

 

(i) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of a party to indemnify and hold harmless another party pursuant
to this Section 5.13 shall terminate at the close of business on the 30th day
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation
or extension thereof) (except for claims for indemnification asserted prior to
the end of the applicable survival period set forth in this Section 5.13(i),
which claims shall survive until final resolution thereof).

 

Section 5.14 _Credit Support; Third Party Consents_.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that in the course of the conduct of the Business,
Sellers have entered into arrangements (a) in which guarantees (including of
performance under Contracts included in the Business Assets, letters of credit
or other credit arrangements, including surety and performance bonds) were
issued by, or for the account of, Sellers or (b) in which Sellers are the
primary or secondary obligors on debt instruments or financing or other
contracts or agreements, in any such case to support or facilitate
transactions of the Business. Such arrangements by such parties are listed
on 

 



-43-  Section 5.14 of the Seller Disclosure Letter and are hereinafter referred to
as the " _Credit Support Arrangements_." Sellers and Buyer agree that the
Credit Support Arrangements are to be terminated as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing. Buyer agrees to (i) use reasonable best efforts
to obtain replacement Credit Support Arrangements, which will be in effect at
the Closing or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, (ii) repay, or
cause the repayment of, all debt and other obligations to which such Credit
Support Arrangements relate (and cause the cancellation of such Credit Support
Arrangements) or (iii) arrange for itself or one of its subsidiaries to be
substituted as the obligor thereon as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing and, in each case, obtain the release of Sellers and their respective
Affiliates from any such Credit Support Arrangements. Buyer shall indemnify
and hold such Seller and such Affiliates harmless for any Losses incurred by
such Seller or such Affiliates from and after the Closing with respect to such
Credit Support Arrangements.

 

(b) Buyer acknowledges that certain Contracts of the Business may require
consent, notice or some other action prior to or on the Closing in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and may impose indemnity
obligations, including provisions for joint and several liability, upon
Sellers, including those agreements listed on Section 3.2 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter (collectively, the " _Consent Contracts_ "). Buyer shall
indemnify and hold such Seller and such Affiliates harmless for any Losses
incurred by such Seller or such Affiliates from and after the Closing
with respect to such Consent Contracts (other than any Losses resulting or
arising from Sellers failure to include any Consent Contracts on Section 3.2
of the Seller Disclosure Letter), including with respect to the failure to
obtain any consents required for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Liabilities incurred by Sellers as a result of the
performance after the Closing of such Consent Contract by Buyer, the Acquired
Companies or their Affiliates.

 

Section 5.15 _Termination of Certain Intercompany Accounts_. Sellers hereby
agree that effective as of the Closing, except for (i) the Ancillary
Agreements and the other agreements and instruments required to be delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto and (ii) the Contracts disclosed in Section 5.15 of

Contracts, commitments, transactions, Liabilities or indebtedness, except for
any trade accounts payable or trade accounts receivable to the extent included
in the calculation of Net Working Capital, between the Business, on the one
hand, and Sellers and/or and any of their respective Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies and the Joint Ventures), on the other hand, to be
terminated and cancelled without any further liability and obligation and to
be of no further force or effect.

Section 5.16 _Director and Officer Liability, Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) After the Closing, Buyer shall cause each Acquired Company and the Satair
JV to continue to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer (and similar functionary) of any Acquired Company or the
Satair JV and each such Person who served at the request of any Acquired
Company or the Satair JV as an officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or
other Benefit Plan or enterprise of any Acquired Company

 



-44-  or the Satair JV (each a " _Covered Person_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities of any nature whatsoever, incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to Closing (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Closing, to the fullest extent that any Acquired Company or the
Satair JV would have been permitted under applicable Law and/or any of the
articles of incorporation or association, by-laws and/or other organizational
documents of any Acquired Company or the Satair JV (collectively, the "
_Constitutive Documents_ ") in effect on the date hereof to indemnify
and/or exculpate any such Person (including the advancing of expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law); _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Person to whom such expenses are advanced provides an
unsecured undertaking to the applicable Acquired Company or the Satair JV to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) During the period from the Closing until the six (6) year anniversary of
the Closing Date, (i) Buyer shall cause the Constitutive Documents of each
Acquired Company and the Satair JV to contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation set forth in the Constitutive Documents of
such Acquired Company or the Satair JV on the date of this Agreement, and
(ii) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any Acquired Company or the Satair
JV to amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Constitutive Documents of
such Acquired Company or the Satair JV relating to the exculpation
or indemnification of any Covered Person (unless required by Law), it being
the intent of the parties that the Covered Persons shall continue to be
entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the full extent of the
Law.

 

(c) In the event that after the Closing Date, Buyer or any Acquired Company or
the Satair JV, or their respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Buyer or such Acquired Company or the Satair JV, as
the case may be, honor the indemnification and other obligations of such
Persons, including under this _Section 5.16_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.16_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Person.

as reasonably requested in connection with changing, effective as of the
Closing, the quality system for the Business and the reissuance in Buyers
name of any repair station certificates and ratings and parts manufacturer
approvals (each, a " _PMA_ ") for the products for which the Business has a
PMA as of the date of this Agreement. Further, Sellers shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause the Business to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to, cooperate, before and after the Closing,
in any 

 



-45-  reasonable arrangement designed to afford Buyer the ability to ship products
under Sellers PMAs following the Closing (such as issuing FAA Form 8130-3
tags prior to the Closing or entering into an arrangement whereby products
can be shipped with 8130-3 tags following the Closing) so long as any such
arrangement (i) does not result in liability to Sellers or their respective
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies or the Joint Ventures), (ii) is
in accordance with applicable Laws and (iii) is not unreasonably burdensome to
Sellers or any of their respective businesses. The obligations of Sellers
under this _Section 5.17_ shall expire upon the earlier of (x) the receipt
by Buyer of a PMA for the products for which the Business has a PMA as of the
date hereof or (y) six months after the Closing Date. Buyer shall reimburse
Sellers for any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in the performance
of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.17.

claims shall survive until final resolution thereof), and be of no further
force or effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 3.1 (Organization and Authority), 3.11
(Acquired Company Capital Stock), 3.15 (Brokers and Finders), and
4.1 (Organization and Authority of Buyer and German Buyer) and the first
sentence of Section 3.6 (Title) shall survive the Closing until the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations and the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 3.17 (Taxes) shall survive until the date
that is five years after the Closing Date. The covenants contained in this
Agreement that relate to the performance of obligations after the Closing
shall survive the Closing for the periods contemplated by their terms.

 



-48- Section 8.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date and subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.4,
Sellers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer,
its Affiliates (including, without limitation, German Buyer) and any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, successors or assigns
(collectively, the " _Buyer Parties_ ") against and in respect of any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fines, reasonable costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ ")
actually sustained, incurred or suffered by the Buyer Parties, to the extent
resulting or arising from (i) any inaccuracy of Sellers representations and
warranties set forth in Article III of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement (and solely for purposes of determining the amount of
Losses arising from any inaccuracy (and not for purposes of determining the
accuracy of such representation or warranty) without regard to any qualifiers
based on materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained in the
representation or warranty at issue), (ii) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Sellers set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
(iii) any Excluded Liability or Excluded Asset, (iv) any Business Indebtedness
or Sale Bonus Amount not reflected in the Final Closing Statement, (v) the
National Air Cargo Crash, or (vi) the matters set forth on Section 8.2 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date and subject to Section 8.1, Buyer and
German Buyer, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers, their Affiliates and any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, successors or assigns (collectively, the " _Seller
Parties_ ") against and in respect of any and all Losses actually sustained,
incurred or suffered by the Seller Parties, to the extent resulting or arising
from (i) any inaccuracy of Buyers or German Buyers representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (and solely
for purposes of determining the amount of Losses arising from any inaccuracy
(and not for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representation or
warranty) without regard to any qualifiers based on materiality or Material
Adverse Effect contained in the representation or warranty at issue), (ii) any
breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer or German Buyer set forth in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (iii) the operation of the Business or
the Business Assets or actions taken by or on behalf of Buyer or German Buyer
after the Effective Time (including any Losses by the Seller Parties arising
from the use of the Seller Trademarks pursuant to Section 5.6(b)) or (iv) any
Business Liability.

(c) Any indemnification payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, except as otherwise required by Law.
Such amount shall, to the extent attributable to a specific Telair U.S. Asset,
be allocated to the portion of the Purchase Price attributable to such Telair
U.S. Asset, as determined pursuant to Section 2.8.

(d) Any claims for indemnification for Taxes shall be exclusively governed by
and brought pursuant to the applicable provisions of Section 5.13 other than
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) in respect of inaccuracies of the representations
and warranties contained

 



-49-  in Section 3.17 (which shall not be in duplication of any indemnification
under Section 5.13).

 

(e) The representations and warranties in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and each partys indemnification obligations pursuant to this
Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation or performance of due
diligence for or on behalf on any party or its Affiliates or representatives,
or the knowledge of the partys officers, directors, managers, employees or
stockholders. No Seller may assert in response to any claim for
indemnification submitted by any Buyer Party that Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or representatives was negligent in conducting its due diligence or
failed to conduct its due diligence properly or adequately, and Sellers
hereby expressly waive as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise any such claim
or any claim that any investigation or performance of due diligence limits the
any partys indemnification obligations in this Agreement.

Section 8.3 _Method of Asserting Claims, etc._ In the event that any written
claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable to any
Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from
any Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly,
but in no event more than 30 days following such Indemnified Partys receipt
of such claim or demand, notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand
and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim and
demand) (the " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , that the failure to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 45 days from the
personal delivery or mailing of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to
notify the Indemnified Party whether or not it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such claim or demand. An election to assume the
defense of such claim or demand shall not be deemed to be an admission that
the Indemnifying Party is liable to the Indemnified Party in respect of
such claim or demand. All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying
Party in defending such claim or demand shall be a liability of, and shall be
paid by, the Indemnifying Party, subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article VIII_. In the event that it is ultimately determined that the
Indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold the
Indemnified Party harmless from and against any third party claim, the
Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any and all
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and court costs) incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in its defense of the third party claim. In the event that
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such
claim or demand, except as hereinafter provided, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings. If
any Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such
defense or settlement, it may do so at its sole cost and expense. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle a claim or demand without the consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand unless
the settlement (i) includes a full release of the Indemnified Party from all
Liability related to the claim or demand, (ii) does not include a finding or
admission of any violation of applicable Laws on the part of the Indemnified
Party and (iii) does not restrict the

 



-50-  future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof. To the extent the Indemnifying Party shall control or
participate in the defense or settlement of any third party claim or demand,
the Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party and its counsel access
to, during normal business hours, the relevant business records and other
documents, and shall permit them to consult with the employees and counsel of
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate in the
defense of all such claims. Any notice of a claim by reason of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement shall
state specifically the representation, warranty, or covenant with respect to
which the claim is made, the facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the
claim, and the estimated amount of the liability asserted against the
Indemnifying Party by reason of the claim. As a condition to the indemnity
provided in Section 8.2(a)(v) and notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer agrees that: (i) Sellers shall have exclusive
control over the conduct of legal proceedings relating to the National Air
Cargo Crash; (ii) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) to, cooperate fully with Sellers (including their counsel)
with respect to these efforts, including by giving Sellers access during
normal business hours to the personnel, business records and other information
of the Acquired Companies, the Joint Ventures and the Business; (iii) Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) shall not engage
in communications with third parties, and shall not settle, any claims with
respect to the National Air Cargo Crash without the prior written consent of
Sellers; and (iv) Buyer shall cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) to comply with the provisions of this sentence; _provided_ ,
_however_ , notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Sellers shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to not, without
the prior written consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any claim, demand or legal
proceedings relating to the National Air Cargo Crash unless the settlement (i)
does not include a finding or admission of any violation of applicable Laws
on the part of Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies and the
Joint Ventures) or the Business and (ii) does not restrict the future activity
or conduct of Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies and the
Joint Ventures) or the Business.

Section 8.4 _Indemnification Amounts_.

 

(a) Sellers shall not have liability under Section 8.2(a)(i) until the
aggregate amount of the Losses of the Buyer Parties attributable to
indemnification claims for which a Claim Notice was properly delivered to
Sellers pursuant to Section 8.3 exceeds $4,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and
then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible. 

(b) No Buyer Party may assert a claim for indemnification under Section
8.2(a)(i) with respect to any individual claim for Losses where the amount
that would otherwise be payable by Sellers hereunder relating to such claim
for Losses is less than $15,000 (" _Individual Claim Threshold_ "), and if
such claim does not exceed the Individual Claim Threshold, the amount of such
claim shall not be taken into account in determining whether or not or to the
extent to which the Deductible has been exceeded or reached.

 

(c) The aggregate amount recoverable by the Buyer Parties for indemnification
claims under Section 8.2(a)(i) shall in no event exceed an amount equal to
$4,500,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

 



-51- (d) The aggregate amount recoverable by the Buyer Parties for
indemnification claims made under this Agreement shall in no event exceed an
amount equal to the Purchase Price.

Section 8.5 _Losses Net of Insurance, Tax Benefits, Etc_.

(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under Section
5.13 or 8.2 shall be net of (i) any Tax Benefit (as defined below) inuring to
Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates (other than the
Satair JV) and 70.5% of any Tax Benefit inuring to the Satair JV on account of
such Loss, (ii) any amounts actually received by the Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third
party, (iii) any insurance or other sources of reimbursement actually received
as an offset against such Loss, and (iv) accruals or reserves (or
overstatement of liabilities in respect of actual liability) included in the
calculation of the Net Working Capital or Business Indebtedness on the Final
Closing Statement, _provided_ ,  _however_ , in the cases of clauses (ii) and
(iii), less the reasonable and documented third party costs and expenses of
obtaining such amounts or reimbursement. For purposes hereof, a " _Tax
Benefit_ " shall be deemed to have been actually realized if, and to the
extent, the hypothetical Tax Liability, if any, of the Buyer Parties (or any
affiliated, combined, consolidated or unitary group of which any Buyer Party
is a member) for any taxable year, calculated without taking into account any
Tax items attributable to the indemnifiable Losses (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, without taking into account any net operating loss carryovers or
carrybacks attributable to a indemnifiable Losses incurred in any prior
or subsequent taxable year), exceeds the actual Tax Liability, if any, of the
Buyer Parties (or any affiliated, combined, consolidated or unitary group of
which any Buyer Party is a member) for such taxable year, calculated by taking
into account any Tax items attributable to such indemnifiable Losses
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any net operating loss carryovers or
carrybacks attributable to a indemnifiable Losses incurred in any prior or
subsequent taxable year (determined by treating such indemnifiable Losses as
the last item claimed in any prior or subsequent taxable year)).

(b) Buyer shall, and following the Closing shall cause the Acquired Companies
and the Satair JV to, seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering
any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance recovery is made or
a third party payment is received by Buyer, the Acquired Companies or the
Satair JV or any of their Affiliates with respect to any Loss for which any
such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery (net of all direct collection costs and
expenses) shall be made promptly to Sellers.

 

(c) If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment required under
Section 8.2 is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any
amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party to this _Article
VIII_ , the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly
after such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not
have had to pay pursuant to this _Article VIII_ had such determination been
made at the time of such payment.

 



-52- Section 8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following Closing, and except (a) to the
extent of non-monetary equitable relief (including specific performance) made
with respect to breaches of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement to be performed following the Closing, (b) claims described in the
following sentence or (c) with respect to matters covered by Sections 2.6,
2.8 and 5.13, the indemnification obligations in this Article VIII shall be
the exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Article VIII shall
operate to limit the common law liability of any party for fraud in the event
such party is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
willfully and knowingly committed fraud against any other party, with the
specific intent to deceive and mislead such other party, regarding the
representations and warranties made herein or in any Ancillary Agreement or in
any certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf of such party pursuant
to this Agreement, and no such liability shall not be subject to, or applied
toward, the Deductible, the Individual Claim Threshold or the Cap.

 

Section 8.7 _Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to or otherwise responsible to
any Indemnified Party for consequential damages, other than consequential
damages resulting or arising from breaches of representations and warranties
set forth in Article III, or punitive damages that arise out of or relate to
this Agreement or the performance or breach thereof or any liability retained
or assumed hereunder other than damages paid to an unaffiliated third party
claimant.

 

Section 8.8 _No Set-Off_. Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall have any right to
set-off any Losses (including indemnification obligations under Section 8.2)
against any payments to be made by either of them pursuant to this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements, or otherwise.

 

 _ARTICLE IX_

MISCELLANEOUS 

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

 

(a) by written agreement of Buyer and each Seller;

 

(b) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other hand, by giving
written notice of such termination to the other party or parties, if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to July 31, 2015 (the " _End Date_
"); _provided_ that if on the End Date, the conditions to Closing set forth in
Sections 6.1(f) and 6.2(e) shall not have been satisfied or waived but all
other conditions to Closing shall have been satisfied or waived (or, in the
case of conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, shall
be capable of being satisfied on such date), then the End Date may be
extended by Sellers (in their sole discretion) until September 30, 2015; and
_provided_ , _further,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to a party that has breached in
any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that
shall have primarily caused the failure of the Closing to occur by such date;

 



-53- (c) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other, if any court
of competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental Authority shall
have issued a statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or injunction or taken
any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such statute, rule,
regulation, order, decree or injunction or other action shall have become
final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) shall not be available to a party that has
breached in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any
manner that shall have primarily caused the issuance of such statute, rule,
regulation, order, decree or injunction or taken any other action; or

(d) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other, by giving
written notice of such termination to the other party or parties, if there
has been a breach by such other party or parties of any representation,
warranty or covenant in this Agreement, which breach is the sole cause of the
failure of the conditions in _Article VI_  to be satisfied, and such breach
is not cured prior to the earlier of the End Date and the date which is 30
days after the breaching partys receipt of written notice of such breach (and
provided that the party or parties seeking to terminate this Agreement is not
then in material breach of this Agreement).

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1, this Agreement shall thereafter
become void and have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability
to the other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers
or employees, except for the obligations of the parties hereto contained in
this Section 9.2 and in Sections 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12,
9.13 and 9.14, which shall survive such termination in accordance with their
terms and except that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability
for any willful breach of any representation or failure to perform any
covenant set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.

 

Section 9.3 _Collection of Receivables or Excluded Assets_. If, following the
Closing, AAR Manufacturing or any of its Affiliates receives a payment that
constitutes or is in respect of a Telair U.S. Asset, AAR Manufacturing shall
promptly pay such amount to Buyer. If, following Closing, Buyer, any Acquired
Company or any of their Affiliates receives a payment that constitutes or is
in respect of an Excluded Asset, Buyer or the Acquired Company, as the case
may be, shall promptly pay such amount to Sellers.

 

Section 9.4 _Expenses_. Unless otherwise indicated herein (including Section
5.2(b)(i)), the parties shall bear their own respective out-of-pocket
expenses (including all compensation and expenses of counsel, financial
advisors, consultants, actuaries and independent accountants), and Sellers
shall bear all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Acquired
Companies and the Joint Ventures, incurred in connection with the preparation
and execution of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including filing fees.

 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding on the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Except as provided in the following sentence, this Agreement may not
be assigned by any party hereto without the express prior written consent of
the other party. Buyer may assign or delegate its rights, 

 



-54-  obligations or liabilities under this Agreement in whole or in part to a
Subsidiary of Buyer (including, without limitation, German Buyer); _provided_
, _however_ , that in such event, Buyer shall remain fully liable for the
fulfillment of all such obligations and liabilities hereunder. Any attempted
assignment or delegation in contravention hereof shall be null and void.

 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Rights_. Except as otherwise
contemplated herein (including Sections 5.16, 8.2(a) and 8.2(b)), this
Agreement (along with the Seller Disclosure Letter and the Buyer Disclosure
Letter) and the Ancillary Agreements (a) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof (other
than the Confidentiality Agreement); and (b) are not intended to confer upon
any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable
right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement. Except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, this Agreement and all of its provisions and conditions are for the
sole and exclusive benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their
successors and assigns. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between
the terms of this Agreement (including the representations, warranties,
covenants and indemnification provisions hereof) and the terms of any
other documents delivered or required to be delivered in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Agreement shall supersede such
conflicting or inconsistent terms (including, by way of illustration and not
limitation, an instance where a warranty in a deed of transfer imposes,
implicitly or explicitly, greater obligations on the grantor than are imposed
by the terms of this Agreement) in such other documents and the terms of this
Agreement shall define the rights and obligations of the parties and their
respective officers, directors, employees, equityholders and Affiliates with
respect to the subject matter of such conflict or inconsistency.

Section 9.7 _Disclosure Letters_. The disclosures made on any section of the
Seller Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be made with respect to (i) the
corresponding representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and (ii) any
other representation or warranty of Sellers to the extent (solely in the case
of this clause (ii)) it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure relates
to such other representation or warranty. Inclusion of any matter in any
section of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall expressly not be deemed to
constitute an admission by Sellers or otherwise imply that any such matter is
material, has a Material Adverse Effect or creates a measure for, or further
defines the meaning of, materiality or Material Adverse Effect and their
correlative terms for the purposes of this Agreement. Any capitalized and
undefined term used in any section of the Seller Disclosure Letter and the
Buyer Disclosure Letter shall have the same meaning assigned to such term
herein.

 

Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original,
but all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument.

Section 9.9 _Section Headings_. The article, section and paragraph headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not in
any, way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law; _provided_ ,
that in the event it is determined that the Court of Chancery lacks subject
matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims asserted in any such action or
proceeding, then in lieu of clause (c) above, the parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago with respect
to all actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Process in any such proceeding may
be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees
that mailing by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, of
any service of process on such party to its address as specified in or
pursuant to Section 9.10 shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party.

 

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTIES MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH
RESPECT TO ANY SUIT OR ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NEITHER IT
NOR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
IT WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL. FURTHER,
EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE OTHER PARTY RELIED ON THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO
JURY TRIAL AS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

 

Section 9.13 _Illegality_. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.

Section 9.14 _Public Announcements_. Buyer and Sellers agree to issue a joint
press release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, which press release shall be
substantially in the form of the draft previously approved by both parties on
the date hereof. Sellers and Buyer shall agree on the time and manner of
distribution of the press release, and no party shall make the press release
public prior to such time. Buyer and Sellers agree not to make any public
announcements or issue any press releases in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consent

 



-57-  of each other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
_provided,_ _however_ , that the parties may make any such announcements or
statements which such party has been advised by counsel may be required by
applicable Law (including stock exchange regulations).

Section 9.15 _Specific Performance_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for
any such breach. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity.

Section 9.16  _Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver_. Winston and
Strawn LLP has represented one or more of Sellers, the Acquired Companies and
the Joint Ventures. The parties recognize the commonality of interest that
exists and will continue to exist until Closing, and the parties agree that
such commonality of interest should continue to be recognized after the
Closing. Specifically, the parties agree that (a) Buyer shall not, and shall
not cause the Acquired Companies or the Joint Ventures to, seek to have
Winston and Strawn LLP disqualified from representing Sellers in connection with
any dispute that may arise between Sellers and Buyer, the Acquired Companies
or Joint Ventures in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and (b) in connection with any dispute that may arise
between Sellers and Buyer, the Acquired Companies or the Joint Ventures,
Sellers (and not Buyer, the Acquired Companies or the Joint Ventures) will
have the right to decide whether or not to waive the attorney-client privilege
that may apply to any communications between the Acquired Companies or Joint
Ventures and Winston and Strawn LLP relating to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby that occurred before the Closing.

Section 9.17 _TransDigm Guarantee_. Buyer absolutely, irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees the full and timely payment and performance of the
obligations of German Buyer when due and payable or required to be performed,
as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement. If German Buyer fails
to discharge any of its obligations when due under this Agreement, upon
written notice from Sellers to Buyer of such failure, Buyer will perform and
discharge such obligations. To enforce the obligations of Buyer in this
Section 9.17, it shall not be necessary for Sellers first to (a) institute
suit or exhaust its remedies against German Buyer or any other Person, (b)
join German Buyer or any other Person in any action seeking to enforce any
obligation hereunder or (c) resort to any other means of obtaining payment or
