of counsel, that upon transfer, each such converted Preferred Unit should have intrinsic economic and U.S. federal income tax characteristics to the transferee, in all material respects, that are the same as the intrinsic economic and U.S. federal
income tax characteristics that a Common Unit (other than a converted Preferred Unit) would have to such transferee upon transfer, provided that in all events such determination shall be made within 5 Business Days of the date of conversion or
receipt by the Partnership of the notice of transfer, as applicable. The General Partner shall act in good faith and shall make the determinations set forth in this Section&nbsp;6.9(b) as soon as practicable following a Conversion Date or as earlier

converted to Common Units and such Unrealized Gain was allocated to such Preferred Holder pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.3(d)(i) of the Partnership Agreement (taking proper account of allocations of higher priority), such Preferred Holder&#146;s Capital
Account in respect of its Common Units would be equal to the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit. If at any time a Preferred Holder makes such a request and such Preferred Holder has already made two (2)&nbsp;such requests during a calendar
year, then such Preferred Holder shall reimburse the Partnership for all documented third-party expenses reasonably associated with such request. </P> <P STYLE="font-size:6pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

Partnership, the Partners, any other Persons who acquires an interest in a partnership interest or any other Person who is bound by this Agreement, for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee

knowledge that the Indemnitee&#146;s conduct was criminal. The Limited Partners, any other Person who acquires an interest in a partnership interest or any other Person who is bound by this Agreement, each on their own behalf and on behalf of the

so, in its individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as the general partner of the Partnership, whether under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the General Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to
do so, are entitled, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to make such determination or to take or decline to take such other action free of any fiduciary or other duty existing at law, in equity or otherwise or obligation whatsoever to the
Partnership, any Limited Partner, any other Person who acquires an interest in a partnership interest or any other Person who is bound by this Agreement, and the General Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, shall not, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, be required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by this Agreement any other agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at equity. By way of
illustration and not of limitation, whenever the phrases, &#147;at the option of the General Partner,&#148; &#147;in its discretion&#148; or some variation of those phrases, are used in this Agreement, it indicates that the General Partner is acting
in its individual capacity. For the avoidance of doubt, whenever the General Partner votes or transfers its partnership interests or refrains from voting or transferring its partnership interests, it shall be acting in its individual capacity. The
General Partner&#146;s organizational documents may provide that determinations to take or decline to take any action in its individual, rather than representative, capacity may or shall be determined by its members, if the General Partner is a
limited liability company, stockholders, if the General Partner is a corporation, or the members or stockholders of the General Partner&#146;s general partner, if the General Partner is a limited partnership. </P>
