Section 1.6 _Motor Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

  



  

(a) Each option to purchase a share of Motor Common Stock (" _Motor
Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Reincorporation
Merger Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall (i) be assumed by
ParentCo and become, as of the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time, an
option (a " _Motor Exchange Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and
conditions (including applicable vesting requirements) as applied to each such
Motor Stock Option immediately prior to the Reincorporation Merger Effective
Time, the number of shares of ParentCo Common Stock that is equal to the
number of shares of Motor Common Stock subject to such Motor Stock Option
immediately prior to the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time, at an
exercise price per share of ParentCo Common Stock equal to the exercise price
for each such share of Motor Common Stock subject to such Motor Stock Option
immediately prior to the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time (including
applicable vesting, exercise and expiration provisions) and (ii) cease to
represent an option or right to acquire shares of Motor Common Stock. The
number of shares of ParentCo Common Stock, the exercise price per share of
ParentCo Common Stock, and any other rights of a holder of a converted Motor
Exchange Option shall be determined in a manner that complies with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder and Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder, as applicable.

  



  

(b) Each restricted share of Motor Common Stock (" _Motor
Restricted Stock_ ") and each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
receive shares of Motor Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in part
by the value of a number of shares of Motor Common Stock granted by Motor
outstanding immediately prior to the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time
(including Motor restricted stock units, phantom units, deferred stock units,
stock equivalents and dividend equivalents), other than Motor Stock Options
(each, other than Motor Stock Options, a " _Motor Stock-Based Award_ "), shall
be assumed by ParentCo and become, as of the Reincorporation Merger Effective
Time, an award, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable
vesting requirements and deferral provisions) as applied to each such Motor
Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the Reincorporation Merger Effective
Time, with respect to the number of shares of ParentCo Common Stock that is
equal to the number of shares of Motor Common Stock subject to the Motor
Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the Reincorporation Merger Effective
Time. For the avoidance of doubt, shares of Motor Common Stock issued in
connection with the settlement of Motor Stock-Based Awards which vest on or
prior to the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time (including vested Motor
Restricted Stock) shall be treated in the manner set forth in _Section
1.5(b)(i)_.

  



  

(c) At or prior to the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time,
Motor, the Motor Board and its compensation committee, as applicable,
and ParentCo, the ParentCo Board, and its compensation committee, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are
necessary, including obtaining any necessary consents and providing any
necessary notices, to (i) effectuate the provisions of this _Section 1.6_ and
(ii) cause ParentCo to assume the Motor Stock Plans and award agreements
issued thereunder.

  



  

(d) As of the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time, ParentCo shall
be deemed a "successor issuer" for purposes of continuing offerings of Motor
under the Securities Act. As soon as practicable and in any event within 15
Business Days following the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time, ParentCo
shall, to the extent necessary under the Securities Act, file post-effective
amendments to Motor's currently effective registration statements, adopting
such statements as its own registration statements for all purposes of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and setting forth any additional
information necessary to reflect any material changes made in connection
with, or resulting from, the succession or necessary to keep the registration
statements from being misleading.

Section 1.7 _Payment for Securities_.

  



  

(a) _Reincorporation Merger Exchange_. Each certificate that,
immediately prior to the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time, represented
shares of Motor Common Stock, and all shares of Motor Common Stock held in
book-entry form immediately prior to the Reincorporation Merger Effective
Time, shall, from and after the Reincorporation Merger Effective Time, become
a certificate that represents, or a book-entry share representing,
respectively, an equal number of shares of ParentCo Common Stock.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Fund_. Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company,
its applicable Affiliate(s) or another Person selected by Motor and
reasonably acceptable to Surge shall act, at Motor's sole expense, as the
paying and exchange agent for the purpose of effecting the payment and
delivery of the Surge Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in
accordance with this Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement, to be
entered into by and among the Exchange Agent, Motor and the Representative, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Motor, Surge and the Exchange
Agent (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "). Promptly (and in no event more
than one Business Day) after the Combination Merger Effective Time, ParentCo
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent evidence of
the aggregate number of shares of ParentCo Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section 1.5(c)(i)_ as Surge Closing Merger Consideration, as set forth in
the Final Allocation Schedule (such evidence of book-entry shares of ParentCo
Common Stock, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of
the Surge Unitholders converted pursuant to _Section 1.5(c)(i)_  and, for
avoidance of doubt, excluding any shares of ParentCo Common Stock to be
deposited in the Escrow Account. ParentCo shall cause the Exchange Agent to
make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of such portion of the Surge
Closing Merger Consideration to the Surge Unitholders out of the Exchange
Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(c) _Procedures for Surrender_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing, ParentCo shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail
to each Surge Unitholder: (i) a letter of transmittal for use in exchanging
Surge Units (other than Surge Cancelled Units) for payment of such Surge
Unitholder's applicable portion of the Surge Merger Consideration, which
letter of transmittal shall specify that the delivery of Surge Units (other
than Surge Cancelled Units) shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon delivery of such letter of transmittal to the
Exchange Agent or such other agent as may be appointed by ParentCo (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (ii) instructions in customary form for
effecting the surrender of the Surge Units (other than Surge Cancelled Units)
in exchange for payment of such Surge Unitholder's portion of the Surge
Closing Merger Consideration. Upon (i) surrender of Surge Units (other than
Surge Cancelled Units) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by ParentCo, (ii) delivery of a
letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Surge Units, (iii) delivery of a properly completed IRS Form W-9 or, if
applicable, the appropriate IRS Form W-8 and any other documentation
expressly required by its terms to be provided in connection with the Letter
of Transmittal, and (iv) if applicable pursuant to _Section 4.16_ , the
execution and delivery to ParentCo of a Lock-Up Agreement, each Surge
Unitholder shall be entitled to receive such Surge Unitholder's portion of
the Surge Closing Merger Consideration and percentage of the Escrow Amount
released pursuant to _Section 1.7(g) _ (if any) as is set forth in the Final
Allocation Schedule, for each such Surge Unit held by them. Any Surge Units so
surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. The Surge Closing Merger
Consideration and Escrow Amount released pursuant to _Section 1.7(g) _ (if
any) paid upon the surrender for exchange of Surge Units pursuant to this
_Section 1.7(c) _ will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Surge Units. If payment of the Surge Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Surge Units is registered, it will be a condition precedent
of payment that the Surge Units so surrendered will be properly endorsed or
will be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such
payment will have paid any transfer or similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment of a Surge Unitholder's portion of the Surge Closing Merger
Consideration or percentage of the Escrow Amount released pursuant to
_Section 1.7(g)_ (if any) to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Surge Unit so surrendered or will have established to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable. Any
other transfer or similar Taxes incurred in connection with the Mergers will
be paid by ParentCo; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such Taxes that are
solely the obligation of the Surge Blockers or their respective shareholders
under applicable Law shall be paid by the respective Surge Blockers or their
shareholders, as applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Surge Unit (other than Surge Cancelled Units) will be deemed at any time
after the Combination Merger Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the portion of the Surge Closing Merger Consideration and percentage
of the Escrow Amount released pursuant to _Section 1.7(g) _ (if any)
applicable to such Surge Unit.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the
12-month anniversary of the Combination Merger Effective Time, ParentCo shall
be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Exchange Fund not disbursed to Surge Unitholders, and thereafter such Surge
Unitholders shall be entitled to look only to ParentCo (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Surge Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their
Surge Units and compliance with the procedures in _Section 1.7(c)_ , without
interest.

  



  

(e) _Payment of EARs_. After the Closing, but in no event later
than the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date, in accordance with
the provisions of the EAR Agreements and subject to applicable withholding
Taxes, ParentCo shall pay to each holder of an EAR the applicable portion of
the Surge Closing Merger Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to
_Section 1.5(c)(iv)_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt
of any Remaining Escrow Amount payable to holders of an EAR pursuant to 
_Section 1.7(g)_ , ParentCo shall pay to each holder of EARs the applicable
percentage of the Remaining Escrow Amount payable to such holder pursuant to
_Section 1.5(c)(iv)_. Prior to making any payments to holders of EARs under
this _Section 1.7(e)_ , ParentCo shall withhold a number of shares of
ParentCo Common Stock from each holder's applicable portions of the Surge
Closing Merger Consideration and/or the Remaining Escrow Amount, as
applicable, as necessary to satisfy the payment of applicable
withholding Taxes required to be made with respect to each such payment, and
ParentCo shall properly account for such payments.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(f) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of ParentCo
Common Stock shall be issued at the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.5_. In
lieu of any fractional shares, the fractional amount of ParentCo Common Stock
which any Surge Equityholder would otherwise be entitled to receive under
_Section 1.5_ shall be delivered into the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section
1.7(g)_. No fraction of a share of ParentCo Common Stock shall be paid to any
Surge Equityholder out of the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 1.7(g)_ or
the Escrow Agreement. In lieu of any fractional shares, the fractional amount
of ParentCo Common Stock that any Surge Equityholder would otherwise be
entitled to receive (after aggregating all fractional shares otherwise
payable to such Surge Equityholder in respect of each of their Surge Units and
EARs) shall be retained in the Escrow Account. With respect to any fractional
shares remaining in the Escrow Account or upon termination of the Expiration
Date (after aggregating all Equity Interests held by such Surge Equityholder),
the fractional amount of ParentCo Common Stock which any Surge Equityholder
is entitled to receive under _Section 1.7(g)_  or the Escrow Agreement shall
be paid in cash based on the Motor Stock Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that
ParentCo shall not be obligated to deliver any cash to the Escrow Agent with
respect to such cash payments until such time as such cash payments in lieu
of fractional shares become due.

  



  

(g) _Escrow Account_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the other provisions
of this _ARTICLE 1_ , at the Closing, ParentCo shall withhold from the
Surge Merger Consideration payable to Surge Equityholders, and transfer to a
Person to be selected by Motor and reasonably acceptable to Surge (it being
agreed that Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company or its applicable
Affiliate(s) shall be deemed to be acceptable), as agent to ParentCo and the
Representative (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), the Escrow Amount, to the account
(or accounts) designated by the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Account_ "), in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement to be entered into by and among the Escrow Agent, Motor, ParentCo
and the Representative, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Motor, Surge and the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), which will be
executed prior to the Closing. The Escrow Amount shall constitute security for
the benefit of ParentCo with respect to any amounts that may become due to
ParentCo pursuant to _ARTICLE 7_. The Parties agree that, for U.S. federal
(and applicable state and local) income tax purposes, the Surge Equityholders
shall be treated as the owners of the ParentCo Common Stock representing the
Escrow Amount and no Party will take any position inconsistent therewith
(except as otherwise required by Law). The terms of the Escrow Agreement shall
provide that shares of ParentCo Common Stock deposited into the Escrow
Account shall be treated as outstanding shares by ParentCo and such shares
shall retain all voting rights, which shall be voted by the Representative in
accordance with _Section 4.20(a)(viii)_ , and all dividend rights (with any
such dividends being deposited in the Escrow Account and becoming subject to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement).

  



  

(ii) If, on the 15-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Expiration Date_ "), following the making of all payments due pursuant to
_Section 7.2_ , if any, and the retention of the amount of shares of ParentCo
Common Stock equal to the value, if any, of claims for indemnification under
_Section 7.2_  properly asserted in writing prior to such date by the
Indemnitees but not yet resolved as of the Expiration Date (such claims, the
" _Unresolved Claims_ "), there are any amounts then remaining in the Escrow
Account (the " _Remaining Escrow Amount_ "), then ParentCo and the
Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to release to (A) the Exchange Agent (for distribution to Surge Equityholders
(other than the holders of EARs) as of immediately prior to the Combination
Merger Effective Time) the percentage of the Remaining Escrow Amount payable
to such Surge Equityholders as set forth in the Final Allocation Schedule and
(B) ParentCo (for distribution to the holders of EARs as of immediately prior
to the Combination Merger Effective Time) the percentage of the Remaining
Escrow Amount payable to holders of EARs set forth in the Final Allocation
Schedule, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Upon final resolution of any Unresolved
Claim in respect of which amounts had been retained (to the extent not
utilized to satisfy such Unresolved Claims), ParentCo and the Representative
shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent that
such amounts shall be deemed to have become the Remaining Escrow Amount and
shall be paid in accordance with the process set forth in the preceding
sentence and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

Section 1.8 _Withholding Rights_. Motor, ParentCo, Surviving
Surge and the Exchange Agent (and any agent acting on behalf of any of them,
including ParentCo's payroll process and Surviving Surge's payroll processor)
shall, acting reasonably, be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law provided that, except for withholding pursuant to  _Sections 1.7(e)_
and _1.7(g)_ hereof or withholding due to a failure to provide a properly
completed and executed IRS Form W-9 pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_ hereof and
in accordance with Section 6.01 of IRS Notice 2018-29, the applicable payor
shall notify the applicable recipient in writing of its intention to deduct or
withhold any such amount prior to making such withholding, together with an
explanation of the legal basis for such deduction or withholding, and shall
reasonably cooperate with the applicable recipient to minimize or eliminate
such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
deducted and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

or threatening to rescind, revoke, suspend, modify or not renew any Surge
Permit and there has not been any investigation or inquiry by a Governmental
Entity pending or, to the Knowledge of Surge, threatened against Surge at any
time since January 1, 2016. Surge is not a party to any Order that: (x)
materially restricts its conduct of its business or assets; or (y) would
otherwise reasonably be expected to, either individually or in the aggregate,
result in a Surge Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(c) Since January 1, 2016, neither Surge nor, to the Knowledge of
Surge, any Representatives acting on its behalf, have, directly or
indirectly, (i) used any funds for unlawful contributions, gifts,
entertainment or other unlawful payments, or failed to disclose fully
any such contributions in violation of Law; (ii) given, offered, promised, or
authorized to give, any money or thing of value to any foreign or domestic

Section 2.7 _Financial Statements_. Attached hereto as _Section
2.7_ of the Surge Disclosure Schedule are true, correct and complete
copies of (i) the audited balance sheets of Surge as of December 31, 2016,
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, (ii) the audited statement of
operations and cash flows of Surge for the periods ended December 31, 2016,
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, (iii) the unaudited balance sheet of
Surge as of March 31, 2019 (the " _Surge Balance Sheet_ " and such date,
the " _Surge Balance Sheet Date_ ") and (iv) the unaudited statement of
operations and unaudited statement of cash flows of Surge for the three
months ended March 31, 2019 (such financial statements, collectively with any
notes thereto, the " _Surge Financial Statements_ "). The Surge Financial
Statements (A) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be expressly
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of interim financial
statements, for normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments which are not
expected to be material individually or in the aggregate), (B) are based on
the books and records of Surge as of the respective dates they were
prepared and the results of the operations and cash flows of Surge for the
periods indicated, (C) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of operations,
cash flows and changes in unitholders' equity of Surge as of the dates and
for the periods referred to therein (except as may be expressly indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of interim financial statements, for normal
and recurring year-end audit adjustments which are not expected to
be material individually or in the aggregate) and (D) complied as to form in
all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements. Surge
maintains a standard system of accounting established and administered in
accordance with GAAP. Surge has in place systems and processes (including the
maintenance of proper books and records) designed to (x) provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of the Surge Financial Statements and
(y) in a timely manner accumulate and communicate to Surge's principal
executive officer and principal financial officer the type of information that
would be required to be disclosed in the Surge Financial Statements. Neither
Surge nor any of its officers or independent auditors has identified or been
made aware of any complaint, assertion or claim regarding Surge's financial
controls or the Surge Financial Statements that has not been resolved. Surge
is not a party to, nor does it have any commitment to become a party to, any
joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or similar contract where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Surge in the
Surge Financial Statements. Since January 1, 2016, none of Surge, Surge's
independent accountants, the Surge Board or the audit committee of the Surge
Board has received any oral or written notification of any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees of Surge who have a
significant role in the preparation of the Surge Financial Statements.

Balance Sheet Date (none of which results from, arises out of or relates to
any breach or violation of, or default under, any Contract to which Surge is
a party or by which Surge is bound or to which any of Surge's properties or
assets are subject, or applicable Law), or (c) incurred as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, Surge has no Liabilities of a type required
to be disclosed in accordance with GAAP. During the period from December 31,

Financial Statements.

(b) Since the Surge Balance Sheet Date, there has not occurred,
arisen or come into existence any fact, change, event, development or
circumstance, or any worsening thereof, (i) that would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Surge Material Adverse Effect or
(ii) if taken during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Combination Merger Effective Time, would constitute a breach of _Section 4.1_
(without taking effect of _Section 4.1_ of the Surge Disclosure Schedule).

of termination of employment.

  



  

(i) Except as set forth on _Section 2.10(i)_ of the Surge

benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, increase the amount
of payment, or trigger any payment or funding, of any compensation or benefit

(j) Each (i) Surge Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred

warranty made by Surge in this Agreement or any of the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any investigation pursuant to this _ARTICLE 4_ shall be conducted in
such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of
Surge's business; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Surge and the Surge
Representatives shall not be required to provide access to the books and
records of Surge or to furnish information (whether through Surge
Representatives or otherwise) if doing so would (A) cause a violation of any

each Merger Sub acknowledges that the information provided by Surge and the
Surge Representatives to Motor and the Motor Representatives in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions are subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated January 1, 2019, by and between Surge and

(b) The Representative hereby agrees that it shall, and shall cause its
directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
advisors, agents and other representatives to treat and hold in strict
confidence any Confidential Information and will not use for any purpose, nor
directly or indirectly disclose, distribute, publish, disseminate or otherwise
make available to any third party any of the Confidential Information without
ParentCo's prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Representative may disclose Confidential Information in the event that the
Representative is requested or required to disclose such Confidential
Information pursuant to any Law or other legal process; _provided_ that the
Representative shall (i) provide ParentCo, to the extent legally permitted,
with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the ParentCo or an
Affiliate thereof may seek a protective Order or other remedy and (ii)
furnish only that portion of such Confidential Information which is legally
required to be provided pursuant to the applicable legal process as advised by
counsel and to exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential
Information. For purposes hereof, " _Confidential Information_ " means all
confidential or proprietary documents and information concerning Motor,
ParentCo, Surge or any of their Affiliates (including any information of third
parties where Motor, ParentCo, Surge or any of their Affiliates has an
obligation to keep such information confidential), in each case obtained by

over its operations.

any action to facilitate or encourage or induce the making of, submission or
announcement of, any inquiries or any proposal or offer from any Person
related to an Acquisition Transaction or take any action that
could reasonably be expected to lead to any such inquiries or the making of
any such proposal or offer from any Person; (ii) other than informing Persons

has executed, within 12 months prior to the date of this Agreement, a
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement in connection with its
consideration of a possible Acquisition Transaction return all confidential
information pertaining to Surge heretofore furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of Surge.

  



  

(d) Other than with Motor and its Affiliates, from and after the date
hereof until the earlier of the Combination Merger Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with ___ARTICLE 6_ , Surge shall
not (and shall not authorize or permit any of the Surge Representatives or
Surge's Affiliates to) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other agreement constituting or related to, or which requires Surge to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions or which is intended

48

 



    



  

Section 4.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement, Surge and Motor will use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken,
appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, those things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as
practicable, and (b) obtain from any Governmental Entities any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to
be obtained by Motor or Surge or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to

_however_ , that Surge and Motor will cooperate with each other in connection
with (i) determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with,
any Governmental Entity is required, in connection with the consummation of
the Mergers and (ii) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers
or making any such filings. Surge and Motor will furnish to each other all
information reasonably required or requested in connection with any
application or other filing under the rules and regulations of any applicable
Law in connection with the Transactions. Surge and Motor will use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to give (or will cause their
respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and

Section 4.6 _Public Announcements_. Each of Surge, Motor, ParentCo and
each Merger Sub agrees that prior to the Closing Date no public release or
public announcement concerning this Agreement or the Transactions will be
issued by or on behalf of any Party without the prior review and approval of
Surge and Motor (in each case, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as such public release or public
announcement may be required by applicable Law or Governmental Entity to which
the relevant Party is subject, in which case the Party required to make the
release or announcement will use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow
each other Party reasonable time to review and comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance and shall consider all such comments
reasonably proposed; _provided_ that (a) each of the Parties may make press
releases or public announcements concerning this Agreement or the
Transactions that consist solely of information previously disclosed
in previous press releases or announcements made by a Party in compliance
with this _Section 4.6_ and (b) each of the Parties may make any public
statements in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or
analysts or those participating in investor calls or industry conferences, so

Party in compliance with this _Section 4.6_. The initial press release
announcing this Agreement, any ancillary agreements and the Transactions shall
be in substantially the form mutually agreed upon by Motor and Surge.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) All rights to exculpation, indemnification or advancements now
existing in favor of any member, manager, director or officer of Surge under
the Surge Operating Agreement or any other agreement in existence on the date
of this Agreement and made available to Motor prior to the date of this
Agreement shall survive the Combination Merger and shall continue in effect
for a period of not less than six years following the Combination Merger
Effective Time.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(b) For six years from and following the Combination Merger Effective
Time, without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under
any Surge Benefit Plan, from and after the Combination Merger Effective Time,
ParentCo shall, and shall cause Surviving Surge to, and Surviving Surge
shall, indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers
and managers of Surge (the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") (including, without
limitation, to the same extent such Persons are required to be indemnified as
of the date of this Agreement by Surge pursuant to applicable Law, the Surge
Operating Agreement, and indemnification agreements in existence on the date
of this Agreement with any DandO Indemnified Party and made available to Motor
prior to the date of this Agreement), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements ("
_D andO Claim Expenses_"), incurred in connection with, or arising out of, acts
or omissions in their capacity as directors, officers or managers of Surge
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Combination Merger
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Combination Merger Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions) (a " _D andO Claim_"). In
the event of any such DandO Claim, ParentCo or Surviving Surge shall promptly
pay on behalf of or, within 10 Business Days after any request for
advancement, advance to each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, in each case to
the fullest extent Surviving Surge is so authorized or permitted by applicable
Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any DandO Claim Expenses incurred in
defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating
with respect to any DandO Claim in advance of the final disposition of such DandO
Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the DandO Indemnified
Party of any DandO Claim Expenses incurred by such DandO Indemnified Party in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification
and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other
security, but subject to Surviving Surge's receipt of a written undertaking
by or on behalf of such DandO Indemnified Party to repay such DandO Claim
Expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Law that such DandO
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the DandO Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm
to represent them with respect to each such DandO Claim unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict between the
positions of any two or more DandO Indemnified Parties. Neither ParentCo nor
Surviving Surge shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any Proceeding or threatened Proceeding (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such DandO Indemnified Party hereunder),
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes a full and
unconditional release of such DandO Indemnified Party from all liability or
potential liability arising out of such Proceeding or such DandO
Indemnified Party otherwise consents.

  



  

  

(c) For six years from and after the Combination Merger Effective Time,
ParentCo shall cause Surviving Surge to, and Surviving Surge shall, obtain
and fully pay the premium for the benefit of the DandO Indemnified Parties, as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Combination Merger Effective
Time, a non-cancellable insurance and indemnification policy from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as Surge's current director and
officer insurance carrier that provides coverage for facts or events
occurring on or prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time that are no
less advantageous than Surge's existing policy. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence will be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained by Surge prior to the Combination Merger
Effective Time, which policies provide such DandO Indemnified Parties
with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Combination
Merger Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of this
Agreement and the Transactions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Surge will not
obtain any such prepaid policy if the cost of such policy will exceed 250% of
the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (such
amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such prepaid policy has been obtained
prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time, ParentCo shall cause Surviving
Surge to, and Surviving Surge shall, maintain such policies in full force and
effect and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. If such prepaid
policy is not obtained prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time,
ParentCo shall cause Surviving Surge to, and Surviving Surge shall, obtain
such a tail policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such tail policy cannot
be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual premiums in
excess of the Maximum Premium, ParentCo shall only be required to cause
Surviving Surge, and Surviving Surge shall, only be required to, obtain as
much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Premium.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(d) In the event ParentCo or Surviving Surge (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and will not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then proper provision will be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, will assume the obligations to the DandO Indemnified Parties set forth in
this _Section 4.7_.

  



  

(e) The obligations under this _Section 4.7_ will (i)
continue, notwithstanding any six-year limitation referred to above, until
the final disposition of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation brought or commenced during such six-year period and (ii) not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 4.7_ applies without the consent of
such affected DandO Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the DandO
Indemnified Parties are third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 4.7_).

  



  

(f) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of
expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which any DandO Indemnified Party may at any time be entitled.
No right or remedy herein conferred by this  _Section 4.7_ is intended to be
exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall
be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder
or now or hereafter existing at Law or in equity or otherwise.

  



  

Section 4.8 _Motor Agreement Concerning ParentCo and the Merger
Subs_. Motor agrees to cause ParentCo and each Merger Sub to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

Section 4.9 _Joint Proxy and Consent Solicitation
Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4; NASDAQ Listing Matters_.

  



  

(a) Surge, Motor and ParentCo shall cooperate in preparing, and
ParentCo shall cause to be filed with the SEC as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, (i) a mutually acceptable joint proxy and
consent solicitation statement/prospectus relating to the Motor Shareholder
Meeting and the solicitation of the Requisite Surge Unitholder Approval by
written consent (the " _Joint Proxy and Consent Solicitation
Statement/Prospectus_ ") in preliminary form and (ii) a Registration Statement
on Form S-4 (together with all amendments thereto, the " _Form S-4_ ") (in
which the Joint Proxy and Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus will be
included as a prospectus) relating to the registration of the shares of
ParentCo Common Stock being issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of
Motor Common Stock in connection with the Reincorporation Merger and the
shares of ParentCo Common Stock being issued as Surge Merger Consideration in
connection with the Combination Merger. Each of Motor, ParentCo and Surge
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause the Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy and Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus to comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, Exchange Act, the NYBCL, DLLCA and the Nasdaq rules and to
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff, (B) cause the Form
S-4 to become effective under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as
reasonably practicable and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective as long as
is necessary to consummate the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
mailing the Joint Proxy and Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, each of Motor and ParentCo will (x) provide Surge with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response) and
(y) give reasonable and good faith consideration to all comments reasonably
and promptly proposed by Surge and its legal advisors. Each of Motor and
ParentCo shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take any other action
required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the NYBCL
and the rules of NASDAQ, in connection with the filing and distribution of the
Joint Proxy and Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4,
and the solicitation of proxies from Motor Shareholders thereunder. Each
Party shall advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of the
ParentCo Common Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction. Each of Parties will use commercially reasonable
efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated.

  



  

(b) Motor and ParentCo shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and
rules and policies of NASDAQ and the SEC to enable the listing of the
ParentCo Common Stock on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance. Motor
and ParentCo shall also use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the Transactions; _provided_ that in no event shall
Motor be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified or file a general consent to service of process. Surge
shall, upon request made in writing, furnish to Motor all information
concerning Surge, its directors, officers and (to the extent reasonably
available to Surge) Surge Equityholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Form S-4, including
obtaining a tax opinion from Surge's counsel with respect thereto. Each of
Motor and Surge shall, upon request made in writing, furnish to the other and
their respective counsel such information and representations reasonably
requested with respect to giving any opinion with respect to the
Transactions.

  



  

(c) Surge shall, upon request made in writing, furnish to ParentCo and
Motor all information concerning itself, its directors, officers and (to the
extent reasonably available to Surge) holders of Surge Equity Interests and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Motor, ParentCo or Surge to NASDAQ or any Governmental Entity (including the
Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy and Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus)
in connection with the Combination Merger and the other Transactions to which
Surge is a party. In addition, Surge will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide (i) interim financial statements (including footnotes) that
are timely reviewed by Surge's independent auditor, (ii) management's
discussion and analysis of interim and annual financial statements, (iii) the
consent of Surge's independent auditor to include annual financial statement
reports in the Form S-4, (iv) information necessary to prepare selected
financial data, and (v) information necessary to enable Motor to prepare
required pro forma financial statements and related footnotes, in each case,
to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Motor to prepare the Form S-4.

  



  

   

52

 



    



  

(d) If at any time prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time any
information relating to Surge, or any of its Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Surge that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy and
Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus, so that either of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, Surge shall
promptly notify Motor.

  



  

Section 4.10 _Motor Shareholder Meeting and Surge Written Consent_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness
of the Form S-4, Motor shall, in consultation with Surge, in accordance with
applicable Law and the Motor Governing Documents, establish a record date for
(and commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act
in connection therewith), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of the holders of Motor Common Stock (the " _Motor Shareholder
Meeting_ ") at which meeting Motor shall seek the Motor Shareholder Approval
(such Motor Shareholder Meeting to be held as promptly as reasonably
practicable following declaration of effectiveness of the Form S-4 and the
clearance of the Joint Proxy and Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus by
the SEC and the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to Motor
shareholders of record on the record date established for the Motor
Shareholder Meeting). Subject to compliance with applicable Law, Motor shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or
advisable on its part to cause the Motor Shareholder Approval to be received
at the Motor Shareholder Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Motor
shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Motor Shareholder Meeting (i) to
the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint
Proxy and Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus that is required to be
filed and disseminated under applicable Law is provided to Motor's
shareholders or (ii) if, as of the time for which the Motor Shareholder
Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Motor Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct business at such Motor Shareholder Meeting or to obtain the Motor
Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that a proxy related to the
shares of Motor Common Stock subject to a voting agreement shall be deemed to
have been received by Motor for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that
unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the Motor Shareholder Meeting
shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is more than 30 days
after the date for which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being
understood that such Motor Shareholder Meeting shall be required to be
adjourned or postponed only once as a result of the circumstances described in
the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_  exist); and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Motor Shareholder Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a
date on or after two Business Days prior to the Outside Date. Upon written
request from Surge, Motor shall promptly provide to Surge all voting
tabulation reports relating to the Motor Shareholder Meeting that have been
prepared by Motor or Motor's transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other
Representative.

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

(b) Concurrently with Motor's mailing of the Joint Proxy and Consent
Solicitation Statement/Prospectus to the Motor Shareholders, Surge shall mail
or otherwise deliver the Surge Unitholder Written Consent substantially in the
form attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Surge Unitholder
Consent_ ") and the Joint Proxy and Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus
to the members of Surge owning Surge Units. As promptly as practicable
following the mailing of the Surge Unitholder Consent and Joint Proxy and
Consent Solicitation Statement/Prospectus to the members of Surge owning Surge
Units, and in any event prior to the convening of the Motor Shareholder
Meeting, Surge will deliver to Motor true and complete copies of the Surge
Unitholder Consent executed by each Surge Unitholder that is a party to a
Surge Support Agreement, as well as any other executed Surge Unitholder
Consent that Surge receives.

  



  

(c) Promptly following the date hereof, Surge shall prepare and mail or
otherwise deliver to each holder of Surge Warrants any notices required to be
provided to holders of Surge Warrants (a " _Surge Warrant Notice_ "). In
preparing the Surge Warrant Notice, Surge shall consult with Motor, and prior
to mailing or otherwise delivering any Surge Warrant Notice to any holder of
Surge Warrants, Surge shall provide Motor with an opportunity to review and
comment on such documents (including the proposed final version of such
documents).

  



  

Section 4.11 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Parties intend that, for all U.S. federal and
applicable state and local tax purposes: (i) the Reincorporation Merger
shall qualify as a transaction described in Section 351, Section 368(a)(1)(A)
and Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code, and (ii) the Combination Merger
(together with the Reincorporation Merger) shall qualify as a transaction
described in Section 351 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, and, with respect to the Surge Blockers, transactions described in
Section 368(a)(1)(C) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder
(with the Surge Blocker being treated as participating in an exchange under
Code Section 351(a) as contemplated by Revenue Ruling 68-357). Each of the
Parties agrees not to, and not permit or cause any of their
respective Affiliates to, take or cause to be taken any action that would
cause the Reincorporation Merger or the Combination Merger to fail to be
treated for U.S. federal and applicable state and local tax purposes in a
manner described in this ___Section 4.11_. Each of the Parties agrees that
except as otherwise required by applicable Law to file all tax returns and
related reports in a manner which is consistent with the intentions described
in this ___Section 4.11_.

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that the Surge tax partnership will terminate as
of the end of the day on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 708 of the
Code. Following the Closing, the Representative shall prepare or cause to be
prepared, and file or cause to be filed, all income Tax Returns of Surge
required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to any taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "). The
Parties agree that all deductible expenses of Surge arising as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deducted on the final
income Tax Return of Surge for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
to the extent permitted under applicable Law. Without the consent of the
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), ParentCo shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, including
Surviving Surge, to not) (a) except as required by Law, amend, file, re-file
or otherwise modify any Tax Return of Surge relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (b) enter into any closing agreement with respect to Surge applicable
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (c) settle any Tax claim or assessment
relating to Surge with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (d)
extend or waive the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or
assessment of Surge with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.
ParentCo shall deliver a written notice to the Representative in writing
promptly following any demand, claim, or notice of commencement of a claim,
proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or
court proceeding with respect to Taxes of Surge for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period for which any Surge Equityholder may reasonably be expected to be
liable (including pursuant to _Section 7.2_) (" _Tax Proceeding_ ") and
shall describe in reasonable detail the facts constituting the basis for such
Tax Proceeding, the nature of the relief sought, and the amount of the
claimed Losses (including Taxes), if any (the " _Tax Claim Notice_ ");
provided, however, that the failure to so notify the Representative shall not
relieve the Surge Equityholders of any indemnification obligation that they
may have except to the extent that they are materially prejudiced thereby. The
Representative shall have the right to elect to exercise, at the expense of
the Surge Equityholders, control over the handling, disposition, and
settlement of any Tax Proceeding, by written notice to ParentCo within 30
days after delivery by ParentCo to the Representative of the Tax Claim Notice;
provided, however, that (i) the Representative shall not settle or compromise
any Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of ParentCo (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii)
ParentCo shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate in the
defense of such Tax Proceeding and (iii) the Representative shall have made
arrangements reasonably satisfactory to ParentCo to ensure that any resulting
Losses arising therefrom are paid by the Surge Equityholders (and not ParentCo
or any Affiliate of ParentCo, including Surviving Surge).

  



  

   

54

 



    

  



  

(c) For all purposes under this Agreement, in the case of Taxes that
are payable with respect to any period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date (each, a " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any such Tax that
is allocable to the portion of the period ending on the close of the Closing
Date shall be (i) in the case of Taxes that are (x) based upon or related to
income or receipts, (y) imposed in connection with the sale or other transfer
or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), or (z)
employment, payroll, social security or other similar Taxes, deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended on the close of
the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
with respect to any assets or otherwise measured by the level of any item
(other than income or receipts), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the period ending on the close of the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
period.

  



  

Section 4.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Reincorporation Merger
Effective Time, Motor shall take all such steps as may be necessary
or appropriate to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of Motor
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such Motor
Common Stock) or acquisitions of ParentCo Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to such ParentCo Common Stock) resulting from the
Transactions by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Motor, or who will
become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Motor, to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 4.13 _Transaction Litigation_. Each of Motor and Surge shall
promptly notify the other of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened, against it and/or its
directors or officers relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or any of the Transactions (collectively, " _Transaction Litigation_
"). Each of Motor and Surge shall cooperate with the other in the defense or
settlement of any Transaction Litigation, shall give the other Party
the opportunity to consult with it regarding the defense or settlement of
such Transaction Litigation and shall give the other Party's advice due
consideration with respect to such Transaction Litigation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Motor nor Surge shall be obligated to take any of
the foregoing actions if taking such action would (i) cause a violation of any
obligation of Motor or Surge, as applicable, pursuant to an agreement with a
third party to which it is a party as of the date of this Agreement (so long
as such Party shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of such third party to such action), (ii) cause a reasonable risk of
loss of the attorney-client, work product or similar right, protection or
privilege of such Party or (iii) constitute a violation of applicable Law;
_provided_ that in each case Surge shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide documents and information (or the contents thereof) to the
extent practicable without waiving such privilege or protection or violating
such agreement or Law. Neither Surge nor Motor shall agree to any settlement
of Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of the other
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

  



  

  



   

55

 



    

  

Section 4.14 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Motor, on the one hand, and
Surge, on the other hand, shall promptly advise the other of any change or
event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Surge Material Adverse Effect,
in the case of Surge, or a Motor Material Adverse Effect, in the case of
Motor, or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause
or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.15 _Termination of Affiliate Transactions or Interests_. Prior
to the Closing, Surge shall cause the Affiliate Transactions or Interests to
be terminated with no further financial obligation following the Closing of
Surge; _provided_ that any rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses available to a member, director, manager or officer of Surge in their
capacity as such that by their terms survive termination thereunder shall
survive such termination.

  



  

Section 4.16 _Lock-Up of Shares of ParentCo Stock_. For a period of 12
months following the Closing Date, no Surge Equityholder who receives equal
to or greater than 20,000 shares of ParentCo Common Stock from the Surge
Closing Merger Consideration shall, directly or indirectly, without the prior
written consent of ParentCo (to be granted or withheld in ParentCo's sole and
absolute discretion) (a) pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or
contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant
any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of ParentCo Common Stock
acquired as Surge Merger Consideration (such shares of ParentCo Common Stock
held by such Surge Equityholders, collectively, the " _Lock-Up Securities_
"), (b) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in
whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of Lock-Up
Securities, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of
shares of Lock-Up Securities, in cash or otherwise or (c) publicly disclose
the intention to make any offer, sale, pledge or disposition, or to enter
into any transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement relating to any Lock-Up
Securities, all in accordance with a Lock-Up Agreement. It is agreed that the
proposed distribution by the Surge Blockers of ParentCo Common Stock to their
respective direct shareholders pursuant to the liquidation of such Surge
Blockers contemplated pursuant to _Section 2.16(k)_ is hereby approved;
provided, however, that such direct shareholders, with respect to their
allocable portions of such ParentCo Common Stock received in connection
therewith, become parties to the Lock-Up Agreement and agree to be subject
to the same covenants and restrictions set forth therein (and in this
_Section 4.16_ ) as a Surge Equityholder.

  



   

56

 



    



  

  

Section 4.17 _Restrictive Legend_.

  



  

(a) The certificates representing the shares of Lock-Up Securities
shall bear the following legend (it being agreed that if the shares of
ParentCo Common Stock are not in certificated form, other appropriate
restrictions shall be implemented to give effect to the following):

  



  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO CONTRACTUAL
RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, GENERALLY MAY NOT

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any certificate(s)
representing the Lock-Up Securities issued to the applicable Surge
Equityholders shall be entitled to receive from ParentCo new certificates for
a like number of shares of ParentCo Common Stock not bearing such legend (or
the elimination or termination of such notations or arrangements) upon the
request of such holder at such time as such restrictions are no longer
applicable.

not less than $4,000,000 in new capital to Surge (the " _Surge Capitalization

Section 4.20 _Representative_.

  



  

(a) In addition to the other rights and authority granted to the
Representative elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the Surge
Equityholders hereby to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Representative as its true
and lawful proxy, attorney, agent and representative to act ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Representative shall have no obligation to the Surge
Equityholders to act other than as expressly provided herein), from and after
the date hereof and to do any and all lawful things and execute and deliver
any and all documents, for, in the name of and on behalf of such Surge
Equityholder, and in such Surge Equityholder's name, place and stead, that
may be necessary, convenient or appropriate to facilitate the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including: (i) execution of
the documents and certificates pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) receipt of
payments under or pursuant to this Agreement and disbursement thereof, as
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) receipt and forwarding of notices and
communications pursuant to this Agreement; (iv) administration of the
provisions of this Agreement; (v) giving or agreeing to, on behalf of all or
any of the Surge Equityholders, any and all consents, waivers, amendments or
modifications deemed by the Representative, in his sole and absolute
discretion, to be necessary or appropriate under this Agreement and the
execution or delivery of any documents that may be necessary or appropriate in
connection therewith; (vi) amending this Agreement or any of the instruments
to be delivered to Motor or ParentCo pursuant to this Agreement; (vii) (A)
disputing or refraining from disputing, on behalf of each Surge Equityholder
relative to any Surge Merger Consideration to be received by such Surge
Equityholder under this Agreement or any agreements contemplated hereby, any
claim made by Motor or ParentCo under this Agreement or other agreements
contemplated hereby, (B) negotiating and compromising, on behalf of each such
Surge Equityholder, any dispute that may arise under, and exercising or
refraining from exercising any remedies available under, this Agreement
or any other agreement contemplated hereby and (C) executing, on behalf of
each such Surge Equityholder, any settlement agreement, release or other
document with respect to such dispute or remedy; (viii) voting the Surge
Equityholders' shares of ParentCo Common Stock that are held in the Escrow
Account at any meeting of ParentCo's shareholders, provided that the
Representative shall, without the prior written consent of ParentCo, vote
such shares of ParentCo Common stock in the same proportion as the votes cast
by all other shares voting on each particular matter at such meeting of
ParentCo's shareholders, and an irrevocable proxy with respect thereto is
hereby granted, and (ix) engaging attorneys, accountants, agents or
consultants on behalf of the Surge Equityholders in connection with this
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby and paying any fees
related thereto. Any such actions taken, exercises of rights, power or
authority, and any decision or determination made by the Representative
consistent herewith, shall to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
be absolutely and irrevocably binding on each Surge Equityholder as if such
Surge Equityholder personally had taken such action, exercised such rights,
power or authority or made such decision or determination in such Surge
Equityholder's individual capacity, and no Surge Equityholder shall have the
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 4.20(a)_, in the event that the
Representative is of the opinion that he requires further authorization or
advice from the Surge Equityholders on any matters concerning this Agreement,
the Representative shall be entitled to seek such further authorization or
advice from the Surge Equityholders prior to acting on their behalf. In such
event, each Surge Equityholder shall vote in accordance with the pro rata
portion of the Surge Merger Consideration payable or paid to such Surge
Unitholders in accordance with this Agreement and the authorization of
Persons entitled to receive at least a majority of the Surge Merger
Consideration shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, be
binding on all of the Surge Equityholders and shall constitute the
authorization of the Surge Equityholders. The appointment of the
Representative as each Surge Equityholder's attorney-in-fact revokes any power
of attorney heretofore granted that authorized any other person or persons to
represent such Surge Equityholder with regard to the facilitation of the
Transactions. The appointment of the Representative is coupled with an
interest and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, be
irrevocable by each Surge Equityholder in any manner or for any reason. The
authority granted to the Representative by this  _Section 4.20_ shall survive
and shall not be affected by the death, illness, dissolution, disability,
bankruptcy, incapacity or other inability to act of any Surge Equityholder
pursuant to any applicable Law. Greg Madden hereby accepts his appointment as
the initial Representative.

  



  

(c) The Representative may resign from his position as Representative
at any time by written notice delivered to ParentCo and the
Surge Equityholders. If there is a vacancy at any time in the position of the
Representative for any reason, such vacancy shall be filled by a majority
vote in accordance with the method set forth in _Section 4.20(b)_.

  



  

(d) All acts of the Representative hereunder in his capacity as such
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, be deemed to be
acts on behalf of the Surge Equityholders and not of the Representative
individually. Other than as a result of willful misconduct by the
Representative, the Representative shall not have any liability for any amount
owed to Motor or ParentCo pursuant to this Agreement to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law. Other than as a result of willful misconduct by
the Representative, the Representative shall not be liable to Surge, Motor,
ParentCo or the Merger Subs, in his capacity as the Representative, for any
liability of a Surge Equityholder or otherwise, or for anything that he may do
or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Representative shall not be liable to the Surge Equityholders, in
his capacity as the Representative, for any liability of a Surge
Equityholder or otherwise, or for any error of judgment, or any act done or
step taken or omitted by him in good faith, or for any mistake in fact or
Law, or for anything that he may do or refrain from doing in connection with
this Agreement except in the case of the Representative's willful misconduct.
The Representative may seek the advice of legal counsel in the event of any
dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or his duties hereunder, and he shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, incur no liability in his capacity as the
Representative to Motor, ParentCo either Merger Sub, Surge or the Surge
Equityholders and be fully protected with respect to any action taken,
omitted or suffered by him in good faith in accordance with the advice of
such counsel. The Parties acknowledge and agree the Representative shall not
by reason of this Agreement have a fiduciary relationship in respect of any
Surge Equityholder, and the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Representative's obligations under this  _Section 4.20_ are solely as a
representative of the Surge Equityholders and that the Representative shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, have no
personal responsibility or liability for any expenses, costs or other
liabilities incurred by him in such capacity and the Surge
Unitholders (severally, but not jointly, in accordance with the pro rata
portion of the Surge Merger Consideration payable or paid to such Surge
Unitholders in accordance with this Agreement), shall indemnify and hold the
Representative harmless in respect of all such expenses, costs or other
liabilities (absent the Representative's willful misconduct), including the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the
Representative (it being understood by the Parties that the Representative
shall be permitted to set off against the Representative Expense Fund in
respect of all such amounts).

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

(e) The Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or
other compensation for the performance of his services hereunder, but shall
be entitled to the payment from Surge of all his expenses reasonably incurred
as the Representative. In connection with the foregoing, at or prior to the
Closing, Surge shall transfer $175,000 (the " _Representative Expense Fund_
") to an account controlled by the Representative, to be used by the
Representative solely to pay expenses incurred by him in his capacity as the
Representative. Each Surge Equityholder shall pay to the Representative, on
demand, such Surge Equityholder's share (on a pro rata basis, based on the
pro rata portion of the Surge Merger Consideration paid to each Surge
Equityholder in accordance with this Agreement) of all expenses incurred by
the Representative in excess of the Representative Expense Fund. Upon the
release of the Escrow Account, the Representative shall distribute the
remaining unused portion of the Representative Expense Fund, if any, to
Surviving Surge, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated in writing by Surviving Surge.

  



  

Section 4.21 _No Leakage_. Surge hereby covenants to Motor and ParentCo
that:

  



  

(a) During the period from December 31, 2018 and up to and including
the Closing Date, no Affiliated Person has received or benefited from any
amount of Leakage; and

  



  

(b) no Affiliated Person has consented to or voted in favor of, through
the exercise of any powers or rights it has as director or holder of Equity
Interests of Surge (or the failure to exercise any such powers or rights) or
the giving of instructions to any director or officer appointed by it, any
Leakage to be paid, made or incurred in the period from December 31, 2018 up
to and including the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 4.22 _Financial Statements_. As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the end of each month and calendar quarter beginning
with the month and quarter ending on March 31, 2019, Surge shall provide
Motor and ParentCo with Surge's balance sheet as of the last day of such
month and quarter, and a statement of operations and statement of cash flows
for such month and quarter. Surge shall provide Motor with a reasonable
opportunity to consult with Surge and its representatives, including its
independent accountants, from time to time prior to the Closing, with respect
to the progress of the preparation of such Surge financial statements. Surge
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Motor and ParentCo
and permit Motor and ParentCo to use and disclose such Surge financial
statements to SWK Funding and Silicon Valley Bank.

  



  

   

60

 



    



  

Section 4.23 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  



  

(a) For the period from the Combination Merger Effective Time until
December 31, 2019, ParentCo will provide, or will cause to be provided, to
those Persons employed by Surge immediately prior to the Combination Merger
Effective Time who continue to be employed by ParentCo or its Subsidiaries
(including Surviving Surge) during such period (each individually, a "
_Continuing Employee_ " and collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") (i)
annual base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, and target cash bonus
opportunities (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any equity based
compensation), on terms substantially similar as the total annual base salary
or hourly wage rate, as applicable, and target cash bonus opportunities
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any equity based compensation and
taking account of the difference between ParentCo's and Surge's fiscal
years), provided to the Continuing Employees by Surge immediately prior to the
Combination Merger Effective Time and (ii) other employee benefits on terms
substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits (excluding any
equity based compensation, defined benefit plans or retiree welfare plans)
provided to the Continuing Employees by Surge immediately prior to the

___Section 2.10(a)_ of the Surge Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b) The Continuing Employees shall be given credit for all service with
Surge or any of its ERISA Affiliates, to the same extent as such service was
documented as being credited for such purpose by Surge, under all employee
benefit plans, programs and policies of ParentCo or its Subsidiaries in which
they become participants for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan). To the
extent applicable, ParentCo or its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to, with respect to the applicable plan year
in which the Closing Date occurs, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any
welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in
after the Closing Date, other than limitations or waiting periods that are
already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not
been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any welfare benefit plan
maintained for the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date, and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans
that such employees are eligible to participate in after the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Surge and Motor acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this ___Section 4.23_ are included for the sole benefit of the respective
parties to this Agreement and will not create any right in any other Person,
including any employees, former employees, directors, independent contractors,
consultants or any participant in any Surge Benefit Plan or any beneficiary
thereof. Furthermore, this _Section 4.23_ shall not create any right of
continued employment of a Continuing Employee.

ARTICLE 7. 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 7.1 _Survival_. The Parties, intending to modify the otherwise
applicable statute of limitations, agree that (a) the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall

and agreements contained in this Agreement to the extent they, by their terms,
contemplate or provide for performance prior to or at the Closing shall
survive the Closing until the Expiration Date and (c) the covenants or other

by notice from the non-breaching Party to the breaching Party in accordance
with _Section 7.3_ prior to the expiration date of the survival provided
in clauses (a), (b) or (c), as applicable, of this _Section 7.1_ (the "

66

 



    



  

Section 7.2 _Indemnification by Surge Equityholders_. From and after
the Combination Merger Effective Time and until the Expiration Date, Motor,
ParentCo and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, and
stockholders (the " _Indemnitees_ "), shall be indemnified and held harmless
by the Surge Equityholders as of the Combination Merger Effective Time (the "
_Indemnifying Parties_ "), on a several and not joint basis (except as to the
Escrow Amount held in the Escrow Account), for any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by, or imposed upon, any of them as a result of, relating to or
arising out of any:

  



  

(a) inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
of Surge contained in this Agreement (other than the Surge
Fundamental Representations) or in any certificate or instrument delivered by
or on behalf of Surge pursuant to this Agreement, as of the date such
representation or warranty was made or as if such representation or warranty
was made on and as of the Closing Date (except for representations and
warranties that expressly relate to a specified date, the inaccuracy in or
breach of which will be determined with reference to such specified date);

  



  

(b) inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Surge Fundamental
Representations, as of the date such representation or warranty was made or as
if such representation or warranty was made on and as of the Closing Date
(except for representations and warranties that expressly relate to a
specified date, the inaccuracy in or breach of which will be determined with
reference to such specified date);

  



  

(c) breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation
to be performed by Surge pursuant to this Agreement;

  



  

(d) claim or allegation made by or on behalf of any current or former
holder (or alleged current or former holder) of Equity Interests of Surge or
any of its predecessors or assigns in its capacity as such, including any
claim or allegation of an inaccuracy in the Allocation Schedule;

  



  

(e) claim or right asserted or held by any Person who is a current
officer, director or manager of Surge (against Surge, against Motor,
against ParentCo or against any of their Affiliate) of entitlement to
indemnification or the reimbursement of expenses in connection with any
indemnity claim or any other relief or remedy (under the Surge Operating
Agreement, this Agreement, any indemnification agreement or any applicable
Law providing for indemnification of directors or officers) with respect to
any act or omission on the part of such Person or any event or other
circumstance that arose, occurred or existed at or prior to the Combination
Merger Effective Time;

  



  

(f) Transaction Expenses of Surge outstanding as of the Combination
Merger Effective Time to the extent not paid or satisfied by Surge at or
prior to the Combination Merger Effective Time; and

  



  

(g) Any and all Taxes (i) of or imposed on Surge relating to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (including to any "imputed underpayments" (as defined in
Section 6225 of the Code) imposed on Surge relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period) and (ii) of any of the Surge Equityholders for any period.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

For all purposes of this ___Section 7.2_ , in determining the amount of
Losses arising out of, relating to or resulting from a breach or inaccuracy,
or allegation by any third party which, if true, would be a breach or
inaccuracy (but not whether a breach or inaccuracy has occurred), of
a representation, warranty, agreement or covenant contained in or pursuant to
this Agreement, the Parties agree that any "Surge Material Adverse Effect,"
"materiality" or similar qualifications will be disregarded and each such
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant will be read and interpreted
without regard to any such qualifier.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Claims Procedures_. For all purposes of this _ARTICLE 7_ :
(a) ParentCo is the sole and exclusive Person authorized to act for and bring
Liability Claims on behalf of the Indemnitees; and (b) the Representative is
the sole and exclusive Person authorized to act for and defend against
Liability Claims (including any such claims related to Third Party Claims, as
described below) brought by the Indemnitees.

  



  

(a) At any time that the Indemnitee has or claims to have incurred
Losses with respect to which the Indemnifying Parties are or may be required
to provide indemnification under this Agreement (a " _Liability Claim_ "),
ParentCo, on behalf of such Indemnitee shall deliver one or more written
notices of such Liability Claim (each, a " _Claims Notice_ ") to
the Representative. A Claims Notice will describe the Liability Claim to
which it relates with reasonable specificity, indicate the amount (estimated,
if necessary and to the extent reasonably feasible) of such Liability Claim
that has been paid, suffered, sustained or accrued or is reasonably expected
to be paid, suffered, sustained or accrued by the Indemnitee (the " _Claim
Amount_ "). To the extent that the Claim Amount is not determinable with
reasonable certainty as of the date of delivery of a Claims Notice, ParentCo,
on behalf of such Indemnitee may deliver a Claims Notice stating the maximum
amount that the Indemnitee in good faith estimates or anticipates that the
Indemnitee may pay, suffer, sustain or accrue with respect to the Liability
Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the provision of an estimated or
anticipated amount of Losses will not itself limit the Losses recoverable or
recovered by the Indemnitee. A failure by the Indemnitee (or its
representative) to give timely, complete or accurate notice as provided in
this _Section 7.3_ will not affect the rights or obligations of the
Indemnifying Party except and only to the extent that, as a result of such
failure, the Indemnifying Parties were directly and materially damaged as a
result of such failure to give timely, complete or accurate notice.

  



  

(b) The Representative may, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties,
object to all or any portion of a Liability Claim set forth in a
Claims Notice by delivering written notice to ParentCo (an " _Objection
Notice_ ") by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the date that is the 10th Business
Day after receipt by the Representative of the Claims Notice (the " _Objection
Dispute Deadline_ "). Such Objection Notice shall describe the grounds for
such objection in reasonable detail and set forth the portion of the
Claim Amount being disputed (or estimated, if necessary and to the extent
reasonably feasible) or specify that the entire Claim Amount is being
disputed. If an Objection Notice is not delivered by the Representative to
ParentCo prior to the Objection Dispute Deadline, such failure to so object
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, be a final, binding
and irrevocable acknowledgment by the Indemnifying Parties that the
Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified, defended and held harmless and
reimbursed for the Losses set forth in the Claims Notice, in accordance with
and subject to the provisions of, this _ARTICLE 7_ , and the Indemnitee shall
be entitled to payment in the manner specified in _Section 7.5_. If an
Objection Notice is delivered by the Representative, on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties, to ParentCo prior to the Objection Dispute Deadline,
but such Objection Notice states that the Indemnifying Parties are obligated
to indemnify, or admits liability, only with respect to a portion of the
Losses claimed in the Claims Notice, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be
indemnified, defended and held harmless and reimbursed for the Losses set
forth in the Claims Notice for which no objection was made, in accordance with
and subject to the provisions of, this _ARTICLE 7_ , and the Indemnitee shall
be entitled to payment, in the manner specified in _Section 7.5_ , of the
amount of the portion of the Losses set forth in such Claims Notice to which
no objection was made.

  



  

   

68

 



    



  

(c) If the Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties,
delivers an Objection Notice to ParentCo, by the applicable Objection Dispute
Deadline, ParentCo and the Representative shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights and obligations of the Indemnitee and Indemnifying Parties
with respect to the subject of such Claims Notice. If ParentCo and the
Representative should so agree, a memorandum or certificate setting forth
such agreement will be prepared and signed by the ParentCo, on behalf of
the Indemnitee, and the Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties, and the Indemnitee shall be entitled to payment in the manner
specified in _Section 7.5_. If no such agreement can be reached after good-
faith negotiation within 30 days after the applicable Objection Dispute
Deadline, either ParentCo or the Representative may initiate proceedings to
resolve such dispute in accordance with _Section 8.11_. To the extent it is
finally determined pursuant to _Section 8.11_ that Losses are recoverable
from the Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to payment of
the amount of such Losses in the manner specified in _Section 8.11_ and such
other damages awarded pursuant to _Section 8.11_.

  

  



  

Section 7.4 _Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) In the event that, subsequent to the Closing, an Indemnitee
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement receives notice of
the assertion of any claim or of the commencement of any action or Proceeding
by any Person who is not a Party or an Affiliate of a Party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") against such Indemnitee, with respect to which the Indemnifying
Party is or is reasonably likely to be required to provide indemnification
under this Agreement, ParentCo, on behalf of the Indemnitee, shall give
written notice regarding such claim to the Representative within 10 Business
Days of ParentCo becoming aware that such Third Party Claim is a claim that
the Indemnifying Party is or is reasonably likely to be required to provide
indemnification under this Agreement. ParentCo shall have the right in its
sole discretion to control the defense of and settle all Third Party Claims;
_provided_  that ParentCo may not settle any such Third Party Claim without
the consent of the Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the settlement of any
such Third Party Claim contains an unconditional release by the Person or
Persons asserting such Third Party Claim in favor of the Indemnifying Parties
with respect to such Third Party Claim without requiring payment of any
amounts to be paid in connection therewith or imposing any future restrictions
on the conduct of the Indemnifying Parties other than obligations of
confidentiality. If the Representative consents to any such settlement,
neither the Representative nor the Indemnifying Parties will have any power
or authority to object to the amount or validity of any claim by or on behalf
of the Indemnitee for indemnity with respect to such settlement.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any costs and expenses
of investigation, settlement and defense, including court costs and attorneys'
fees, incurred or suffered by ParentCo or the Indemnitee in connection with
the defense of any Third Party Claim alleging matters that would constitute
a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or any other matter specified in
_Section 7.2_ , whether or not it is ultimately determined that there was
such a breach or inaccuracy, will constitute Losses subject to indemnification
under this _ARTICLE 7_.

  



  

   

69

 



    



  

(b) ParentCo shall keep the Representative reasonably advised of the
status of such Third Party Claim, on at least a monthly basis (and on a more
frequent basis upon the occurrence of material developments, pleadings or
events related to such defense), and shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Representative with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) A failure by ParentCo (on behalf of the Indemnitee) to give timely,
complete or accurate notice as provided in this _Section 7.4_  will not
affect the rights or obligations of the Indemnifying Parties except and only
to the extent that, as a result of such failure, the Indemnifying Parties
were directly and materially damaged as a result of such failure to give
timely, complete or accurate notice.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Indemnification Payments_. No later than three Business
Days after the determination of any indemnification obligation under
_Section  7.3_ or _Section 7.4_ , the Representative and ParentCo shall
provide to the Escrow Agent written instructions to release from the Escrow
Account to ParentCo a number of shares of ParentCo Common Stock having a value
equal to the amount determined to be owing with respect to such
indemnification obligation. For purposes of satisfying amounts that may become
due to ParentCo pursuant to this _ARTICLE 7_, the shares of ParentCo Common
Stock in the Escrow Account shall be valued based upon the volume weighted
average stock price of ParentCo for the 30 trading days ending on the second
Business day prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Certain Limitations_.

  



  

(a) The Indemnifying Parties shall not be liable to the Indemnitees for
indemnification under _Section 7.2(a)_ until the aggregate amount of all
Losses in respect of indemnification under _Section 7.2(a)_ exceeds
$1,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which event the Indemnifying Parties shall
be liable for all such Losses in excess of the Basket.

  



  

(b) Absent fraud or intentional breach by the Parties prior to the
Combination Merger Effective Time, the aggregate amount of Losses
with respect to which the Indemnitees may be entitled under _Section
7.2_ shall not exceed the Escrow Amount and in no event will any of the
Indemnifying Parties be liable for an amount that is greater than the Surge
Merger Consideration actually received by such Indemnifying Parties.

  



  

(c) Payments by the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to _Section 7.2_ in
respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage
that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment actually received (or

Delaware is found to lack jurisdiction, then the Superior Court of the State
of Delaware or, to the extent that both of the aforesaid courts are found to
lack jurisdiction, then the United States District Court of the District of
Delaware (collectively with any appellate courts thereof, the " _Courts_ "),
in any action, suit or proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or to interpret, apply or
enforce this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action,
suit or proceeding except in such court, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action, suit or proceeding may be heard and determined in
such court, (iii) waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any such action, suit or proceeding in any such court
and (iv) waives the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action, suit or proceeding in any such court. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment
in any such action, suit or proceeding will be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in _Section 8.2_ or in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY OR TO INTERPRET, APPLY OR ENFORCE THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (ii) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (iii) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 8.11(C)_.

  



  

Section 8.12 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, this Agreement and any document or
certificate related to the Transactions may be executed and delivered,
including by e-mail of an attachment in Adobe Portable Document Format or
other file format based on common standards (" _Electronic Delivery_ "), in
any number of counterparts, and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed and delivered will be deemed to be an original but all
of which taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered using Electronic Delivery will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, no Party will raise the use of Electronic
Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of
Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each
such Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that such
defense relates to lack of authenticity.

Section 8.13 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that (a) irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and (b) monetary damages would both
be incalculable and an insufficient remedy for such failure or breach. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy they are entitled to
at law or in equity, the Parties shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of
immediate injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof in any
court referred to in _Section 8.11(b)_, without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Parties further waive any requirement for the securing
or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such
injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each Party further
agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that in the event
of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach or
violation, it will not assert the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate or that the consideration reflected in this Agreement was inadequate
or that the terms of this Agreement were not just and reasonable.
