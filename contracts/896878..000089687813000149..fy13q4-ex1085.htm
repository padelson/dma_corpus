REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB



Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to Indigo and the Company that:

Section 4.01 Corporate Existence and Power. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
Applicable Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Since the date of its
incorporation, Merger Sub has not engaged in any activities other than in
connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement.



Section 4.02 Corporate Authorization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
necessary power and authority to enter into and to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a
party; and the execution, delivery and performance by each of Parent and
Merger Sub of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it
is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable. Each of this Agreement and each of the
other Transaction Documents to which it is a party constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to (i) laws of
general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of
debtors and (ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies.



Section 4.03 Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the





transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the filing of a
certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware Secretary
of State, (ii) compliance with the HSR Act and any other Competition Law,
(iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and any other U.S. state or federal securities laws or the laws
of any national securities exchange and (iv) any actions or filings the
absence of which would not be reasonably expected to materially impair the
ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.



Section 4.04 Non-contravention.. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger
Sub or (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03,
contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision
of any Applicable Law, except, with respect to the above-described clauses,
for any such contraventions, conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, Liens
or other occurrences, which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to be material.



Section 4.05 Financial Capability. On the Closing Date, Parent will have
sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately
available funds to pay the Merger Consideration and to perform all other
financial obligations of Parent contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing
Date. Parent has delivered to Indigo a true and complete copy of each of the
executed Debt Commitment Letter and the executed Equity Commitment Letter. As
of the date of this Agreement, neither of the Commitment Letters has been
amended or modified in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither
Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter
or other commitment or arrangement relating to the financing of the Merger
Consideration or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than
those which do not impact the conditionality or the amount of Financing that
will be available on the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, the
proceeds of the Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise
of any or all "market flex" provisions related thereto) will be sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date, including
the payment of the Merger Consideration on the Closing Date. As of the date of
this Agreement, the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters
have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. The Commitment Letters
are in full force and effect and represent a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Parent and each other party thereto, to provide the financing
contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the
Financing Conditions and, subject to the qualification that such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
other laws of general application relating to or affecting rights of
creditors. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has fully paid (or caused
to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other amounts that are due and
payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement, in each case, in connection
with the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
breach or default on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any
other party thereto under any of the Commitment Letters; provided that Parent
is not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect of any
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3
hereof, or compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder. Parent
has no reason to believe that it or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other
party thereto, will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any condition
precedent to the Financing under the Commitment Letters required to be
satisfied for the Financing to occur on the Closing Date; provided that Parent
is not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect of any
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3
hereof, or compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder. There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing, other than the Financing Conditions. The only
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the Debt
Financing on the Closing Date that will be included in the Debt Financing
Documents shall be the





Financing Conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent has no
reason to believe that (i) any of the Financing Conditions will not be
satisfied or (ii) the Financing will not be made available to Parent on the
Closing Date in the event that the Financing Conditions are satisfied. Parent
understands and acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement, the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are not in any
way contingent upon or otherwise subject to the consummation by Parent or
Merger Sub of any financing arrangements, the obtaining by Parent or Merger
Sub of any financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension of any
financing to Parent or Merger Sub.

doubt, any fees or other amounts due under any fee letters relating to any
Debt Commitment Letter, Equity Commitment Letter or any alternative financing
described in Section 6.06 hereof).

discuss the Business and the management, operations and finances of the
Company with the Representatives and Affiliates of Indigo and the Company, and
has had an opportunity to inspect the facilities of the Company and the
Business. Parent has conducted its own independent investigation of the

Company) and has not relied upon any other information provided by, for or on
behalf of the Company, Indigo, or their Representatives, to Parent in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has
entered into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
understanding, acknowledgement and agreement that no representations or
warranties, express or implied, are made with respect to future prospects
(financial or otherwise) of the Company or the Business. Parent acknowledges

information.



(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, each party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to retain the books, records, documents, instruments,
accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences of title and other papers
relating to the Business (the "Books and Records") in such party\'s respective

Books and Records is proposed to be so destroyed or disposed of) and (ii) if a
recipient of such notice shall request in writing prior to the scheduled date
for such destruction or disposal that any of the information proposed to be

promptly as practicable, arrange for the delivery of such of the Books and
Records as was requested by the recipient (it being understood that all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated with the delivery of the requested
Books and Records shall be paid by such recipient).



(d) Without limiting the representations of Indigo set forth in Article 3, no
party shall have any liability to any other party in the event that any
information exchanged or provided pursuant to Section 6.03 is found to be
inaccurate. No party shall have any liability to any other party if any
information is destroyed or lost after reasonable commercial efforts by such
party to comply with the provisions of Section 6.03(c).



(e) From and after the Closing until the fifth anniversary thereof, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any stock
exchange or quotation services on which such party\'s stock is traded or
quoted, each party shall hold confidentially, and shall cause its Affiliates
and Representatives to hold confidentially, all information furnished or made
available by a party (the "Provider") to the other party (the "Receiver")
pursuant to this Section 6.03 and the terms of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and Indigo shall, and shall cause its Representatives to
hold confidential all confidential or proprietary information relating to the
Company or the Business (all such information being referred to as
"Confidential Information"). The parties shall, and shall cause their
Representatives to, use the Confidential Information only in connection with
the performance of this Agreement or as otherwise contemplated hereby.
Confidential Information furnished or made available pursuant to this Section
6.03 shall not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available
to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiver or its
Representatives in violation of this Agreement, (ii) becomes available to the
Receiver or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a Person
other than the Provider or its Representatives who is not known by the
Receiver to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Provider or any
or its Representatives, or is not known by the Receiver to be under an
obligation to the Provider or any of its Representatives not to transmit the
information to the Receiver, (iii) was in the possession of the Receiver prior
to disclosure by the Provider or its Representatives (provided, that any
information regarding the Business in the possession of Indigo prior to the
Closing Date or provided to Indigo pursuant to, or maintained by Indigo under,
the Transition Services Agreement shall not be subject to this provision) or
(iv) is developed by the Receiver independent of any Confidential Information
provided hereunder (provided, that any information regarding the Business in
the possession of Indigo prior to the Closing Date or provided to Indigo
pursuant to, or maintained by Indigo under, the Transition Services Agreement
shall not be subject to this provision). Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall
affect Parent\'s rights in the Business following the Closing. In the event
that the Receiver or any of its Representatives are required by Applicable Law
or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or quotation services on
which such party\'s stock is traded or quoted to disclose any Confidential
Information, the Receiver shall provide the Provider with prompt notice of
such request or requirement in order to enable the Provider to: (i) seek an
appropriate protective order or other remedy, (ii) consult with the Receiver
with respect to the Provider\'s taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of
such request or legal process or (iii) waive compliance, in whole or in part,
with the terms of this Section 6.03(e). In the event that such protective
order or other remedy is not obtained, or the Provider waives compliance, in
whole or in part, with the terms of this Section 6.03(e), the Receiver or its
Representative, as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that the
Receiver is advised in writing by its legal counsel is legally required to be
disclosed and to ensure that all Confidential Information that is so disclosed
will be accorded confidential treatment.



(f) Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require any party to violate any
agreement with any third parties regarding the confidentiality of confidential
and proprietary information or of customer information; provided, however,
that in the event that any party is required under this Section 6.03 to











disclose any such information, that party shall provide notice of the basis
for any such potential violation and use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek to obtain such third party\'s consent to the disclosure of such
information and implement requisite procedures to enable the disclosure of
such information.



Section 6.04 Employee Matters.



(a) No later than eighteen (18) Business Days after the execution of the
Original Merger Agreement, Parent shall make offers of employment to each
Business Employee commencing on the Closing Date or following an interim
consulting arrangement provided in the Transition Services Agreement (which
offers, in each case, shall be contingent on the occurrence of the Closing).
Sufficient number of offers will be made to Business Employees to avoid
triggering the WARN Act. Such offers shall provide each Business Employee
initially with (i) subject to relocations contemplated by the Transition
Services Agreement, the same general location of employment as or immediately
prior to the Closing (which, in any event, shall not be more than 50 miles
from such Business Employee\'s location of employment as of immediately prior
to the Closing); (ii) substantially the same responsibilities as such Business
Employee\'s responsibilities as of immediately prior to the Closing; (iii) a
base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, that is at least equal to that
provided to such Business Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing; and
(iv) non-equity-based incentive compensation opportunities and other employee
benefits (including health, welfare and retirement benefits but excluding any
equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and nonqualified
retirement benefits) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to the Business Employees as of immediately prior to the
Closing. Indigo will reasonably cooperate with Parent and provide Parent with
such information as Parent may reasonably request to comply with this Section
6.04(a). Each Business Employee who accepts such offer prior to the Closing
Date and who commences employment with Parent on the Closing Date or, with
respect to a Business Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is on a leave of
absence approved by Indigo or the Company, on the date such leave ends if such
Business Employee on leave is able to and does return to work immediately
thereafter, provided that such leave ends no later than six (6) months, or, in
the case of a leave whereby the Business Employee is entitled under Applicable
Law to return later than six (6) months, twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date, shall be referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee." Indigo
shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent the employee census
data set forth on Section 6.04(a) of the Disclosure Schedule no later than
five (5) Business Days following the date of the Original Merger Agreement.



(b) With respect to any 401(k), severance or vacation benefit plans, programs
or arrangements maintained by Parent or its Affiliates in which Transferred
Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each Transferred Employee with full
credit for all service recognized by the Company, Indigo and their respective
Affiliates and predecessors prior to the Closing for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accruals (other than benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan); provided that such service
shall not be recognized to the extent such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonably efforts to waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any Parent
Employee Plan that is a health benefit plan that such employees may be
eligible to participate in after the Closing Date and in the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs, other than limitations or waiting periods that
are already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not been
satisfied as of the Closing Date under any health benefit plan maintained for
the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date



(c) Prior to the Closing, neither Parent nor Indigo (including their
Affiliates) shall issue any communication (including any electronic
communication) to any Business Employee without the prior written approval of
Parent and Indigo. The parties shall mutually consider and agree to the
contents,







scope, form and timing of any such communications with the Business Employees
on all employment-related matters in connection with this Agreement (the
"Employment Matters"). At any time following the parties\' agreement in
accordance with the preceding sentence, Parent and Indigo will, upon
reasonable invitation by the other party, participate in any communication
sessions relating to Employment Matters organized by the parties (the
"Employee Sessions"). Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that
at all times (i) they shall consult with each other prior to either or both
parties carrying out any Employee Sessions or otherwise effecting any
communications to the Business Employees relating to Employment Matters and
(ii) without Parent\'s prior written consent, Indigo shall not directly or
indirectly, including through any Affiliate or Subsidiary (and irrespective of
whether on behalf of itself, the Company or Parent): (A) hold any Employee
Session or otherwise effect any communication or meeting to or with Business
Employees relating to Employment Matters or (B) make any oral or written
representations to Business Employees relating to any Employment Matters.



(d) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, cause any Code Section 401(k) plan maintained by
Parent or its Affiliates in which the Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate following the Closing to accept rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) from under the Intuit 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), including the
amount of any unpaid balance of any participant loan made under the 401(k)
Plan.



(e) Indigo shall take all steps necessary to cause the 401(k) Plan to
distribute for rollover (or transfer as part of a direct rollover) any
promissory note evidencing a loan of such Business Employee under such 401(k)
Plan. Following the Closing, Parent shall make non-elective contributions to
any Code Section 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates in which
the Transferred Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing
with respect to each Transferred Employee equal to the amount, if any, that
such Transferred Employee forfeits under the 401(k) Plan as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Indigo shall reimburse Parent for
the amounts of such non-elective contributions that exceed $500,000, in the
aggregate.



(f) Except as set forth on Section 6.04(f) of the Disclosure Schedule, as of
the Closing, Indigo shall assume and/or retain all liabilities or obligations
at any time arising under or in connection with any benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by Indigo, the Company, or any of its Affiliates
or with respect to which Indigo, the Company, or any of its Affiliates has any
fixed or contingent liability or obligation. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Indigo shall retain all liabilities or obligations,
including with respect to any "qualifying event" (as defined under COBRA),
under COBRA or similar Applicable Law incurred by Indigo or the Company on or
prior to the Closing Date or arising as a result of the transactions described
herein, each with respect to the Business Employees or their dependents.



(g) With respect to any Business Employee to which Parent does not offer
employment in accordance with Section 6.04(a), Parent shall reimburse Indigo
for any severance payments and benefits that exceed $2,250,000, in the
aggregate, that are provided to such Business Employee by Indigo or any if its
Affiliates consistent with the severance payments and benefits set forth on
Section 6.04(g) of the Disclosure Schedule. With respect to any Transferred
Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent or any of its Affiliates on
or before the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide
such employee with severance benefits equal to the greater of the applicable
severance benefits (i) provided by Parent or any of its Affiliates, as
applicable, to similarly situated employees as of the applicable termination
date; and (ii) the severance benefits set forth on Section 6.04(g) of the
Disclosure Schedule applicable to such Transferred Employee.



(h) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time as of the Closing
Date to which any





Transferred Employee is entitled pursuant to Indigo\'s vacation time policy
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (i) to the extent consented to by the
Transferred Employee or otherwise permitted by Applicable Law, Parent shall,
or shall cause its Affiliates to, assume the liability for such accrued but
unused vacation time and allow such Transferred Employee to use such accrued
but unused vacation time; or (ii) to the extent such assumption of liability
is not consented to by a Transferred Employee, Parent shall reimburse Indigo
for the payment to such Transferred Employee of such Transferred Employee\'s
accrued but unused vacation time. For the purposes of this Section 6.04(h),
"vacation time" shall include vacation time, paid/flexible time off and
similar arrangements. In addition, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, credit each Transferred Employee with the amount of sick leave to which
the Transferred Employee is entitled pursuant to Indigo\'s sick leave policy
immediately prior to the Closing Date, towards his or her sick leave for
purposes of the sick leave policy maintained by Parent or one of its
Affiliates, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
Parent\'s assumption or reimbursement obligation with respect to all
Transferred Employees under this Section 6.04(h) exceed the aggregate amount
set forth on Section 6.04(h) of the Disclosure Schedule.



(i) After the Closing, each Transferred Employee will continue to hold any
shares of Indigo common stock ("Indigo Stock") and/or vested options or other
rights to acquire shares of Indigo Stock ("Indigo Equity Awards") held by such
Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing, on the terms and
subject to the conditions under which such Indigo Stock and/or Indigo Equity
Awards were held as of immediately prior to the Closing, including the
applicable terms of Indigo\'s employee stock purchase plan. Options to
purchase Indigo Stock held as of the Closing by Transferred Employees may be
exercised to acquire Indigo Stock for only that period of time after the
Closing Date as provided in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing, and each Indigo Equity Award shall remain
subject to the terms of the applicable Indigo plan under which it was granted
and the terms of the original grant.

(j) The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 6.04 with respect to Business Employees are included for the sole
benefit of the respective parties and shall not create any right in any other
Person, including any employees or former employees of the Business, any
participant in any Employee Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any right to
employment or continued employment with Indigo or Parent (or any of their
respective Affiliates), nor require Parent or any of its Affiliates to
establish, adopt, continue or amend any Parent Employee Plan or other benefit
or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement on
or after the Closing Date for Transferred Employees, nor limit the ability of
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the
Company) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, nor create any right to a
particular term or condition of employment with Indigo, Parent or any of their
respective Affiliates, nor prohibit or in any way limit the right of Parent,
Indigo or any of their respective Affiliates to terminate the employment of
any employee at any time and for any or no reason.



Section 6.05 Contribution of Assets and Liabilities. Prior to the Closing,
Indigo shall cause to be contributed to the Company the Assets Contributed to

attached as Exhibit B (the "Asset Transfer Agreement"), other than the India

Section 6.06 Financing.



(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and to
consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, including, but not limited
to, the following: (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment Letters; (ii)







participation by senior management of Parent in, and assistance with, the
preparation of customary rating agency presentations and meetings with rating
agencies relating to such arrangement of loans; (iii) causing the Debt
Financing to be consummated upon satisfaction of the applicable Financing
Conditions; (iv) satisfying on a timely basis all Financing Conditions
required for the Closing Date (other than any condition where the failure to
be so satisfied is a result of the Company\'s failure to furnish information
described in Section 6.06(b)); (v) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt
Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto) or on such
other terms acceptable to Parent and its financings sources; and (vi) in the
event that the conditions set forth in Sections 8.01 and 8.02 and the
Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied,
using its reasonable best efforts to cause the financing providers to fund the
full amount of the Financing. Parent shall give Indigo prompt notice of any
actual breach, repudiation or threatened or anticipated breach or repudiation
by any party to the Commitment Letters of which Parent or its Affiliates
becomes aware relating to the obligation to fund the Financing. Without
limiting Parent\'s other obligations under this Section 6.06, if a Financing
Failure Event occurs, Parent shall (i) immediately notify Indigo of such
Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefore known to Parent, (ii) obtain
alternative financing from alternative financing sources, on terms no less
favorable in the aggregate (including any "market flex" provisions related
thereto) to Parent as are reasonably available for financings of the type
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter in the debt markets at such time,
in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date, as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event, and (iii) obtain, and
when obtained, provide Indigo with a true and complete copy of, a new
financing commitment that provides for such alternative financing subject only

Financing Conditions. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall amend,
modify, supplement, restate, assign, substitute or replace any of the
Commitment Letters or any Debt Financing Document except for (i) substitutions
and replacements pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and (ii)
amendments, modifications, supplements, restatements, assignments,
substitutions or replacements which (A) do not reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount unless the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount or the Debt Financing is otherwise made
available to fund such fees or original issue discount) or (B) do not impose
new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any other
provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or Equity Commitment Letter, in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) materially delay or prevent or
make less likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date or (y) adversely impact the
ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or Equity
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, in each

Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add additional lenders,
arrangers, bookrunners and agents and the Equity Commitment Letter to add
additional investors as permitted herein). Parent shall promptly deliver to
Indigo or the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or
replacement. Parent shall not consent to any assignment of rights or
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter without the prior written
approval of Indigo, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Parent shall keep Indigo informed in reasonable detail of the
status of Parent\'s efforts to arrange the Financing. Upon the request of
Indigo, Parent will confirm (y) with its financing sources their intent and
ability to perform, and the availability of the Financing, under the

Conditions, and (z) that it is not aware of any event or condition that could
reasonably be expected to result in the failure of a Financing Condition.
Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall take any action with respect to
the Financing that could reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Section 6.06 or in any other provision of this
Agreement, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be









required (A) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or (B) to
consummate the Closing prior to the date specified in the proviso of Section
2.03.



(b) The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos in connection with the
Debt Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company and that the Company shall be permitted
to review the use of such logos prior to usage in connection with the
Financing. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' and accountants costs and expenses) incurred by the
Company in connection with the cooperation of the Company contemplated by this
Section 6.06(b) and shall hold harmless the Company and its Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to
Section 6.06(b) and any information used in connection therewith (except with
respect to any information provided in writing by the Company specifically for
us in connection therewith), and the Guaranty shall guarantee the
reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to this
paragraph of this Section 6.06.

developed or sold, and the services developed or provided in connection
therewith (including the offering of the Mint platform and other existing

"Business Software" means the software products, designed for and marketed to
financial institutions to manage any or all of the following: bank based
payments, online banking, and mobile banking.



(c) To the extent Parent believes that Indigo is in breach of this Section
6.07, Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide written
notice to Indigo of the operations of Indigo that Parent believes constitute a
violation of this Section 6.07 and a period of 30 days following receipt of

notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such alleged breach.
The senior management of the parties, including each party\'s legal and
business representatives, shall meet (including via telephone) and attempt in
good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute during the Resolution
Period, it being understood that Parent shall have no obligation to resolve
such alleged breach or make any concessions to Indigo.

hire any Retained









Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)(A) general advertisements in
newspapers and similar media of general circulation (including advertisements
posted on the Internet), job fairs or other general solicitation and (B) use

not be a violation of clause (i)(A) or (ii)(A), as applicable, and (ii) Indigo
shall not be prohibited from hiring or otherwise employing any Business
Employee to whom Parent does not make an offer of employment in accordance
with Section 6.04(a), which persons are set forth on Section 6.07(d)(2) of the
Disclosure Schedule.



Section 6.08 Deletion of Code. Promptly after the Closing, except to the
extent necessary to provide any services under, or as retained in any hosted

Software residing in Indigo systems and of all related documentation,
developer notes, or other confidential information of the Company relating
thereto and shall make no further use thereof. With respect to such Object

will reasonably cooperate with each other and, on or prior to the Closing
Date, will cause, as applicable, PetroTiger and Intuit India to execute the
Asset Transfer Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "India ATA"). For

of this Agreement will constitute Assets Contributed to the Company. Intuit
India shall execute and deliver such further instruments of conveyance,
transfer and assignment and take such other action as may reasonably require
to more effectively convey or otherwise transfer to PetroTiger the India
Assets.

otherwise required by Applicable Law. Indigo shall submit a draft of each of
the Group Tax Returns (but only to the extent related to the Company) to the
Parent as soon as is practicable for review and comment and Indigo shall
consider such comments from the Parent and resolve any disputes with the
Parent in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, Indigo shall pay all Taxes
with respect to any Group Tax Returns for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any such Tax Returns would
reflect Confidential Information about Indigo or any Affiliate of Indigo
(other than the Company), Indigo shall have the option to provide redacted or
pro forma tax returns to the Parent for review and comment.



Section 7.02 Other Tax Returns. Other than the Tax Returns described in
Section 7.01, Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause
to be filed all Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the Company the due
date of which (taking into account extensions of time to file) is after





the Closing Date but only if such Tax Return has not been filed on or prior to
the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner
consistent with prior practice unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. No
later than 15 days before the due date for filing any such Tax Returns (or, if
such Tax Return is not an income Tax Return, as soon as practicable prior to
the due date), Parent shall deliver such Tax Returns to Indigo for its review
and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall pay or cause the Company
to pay all Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the Company
other than any Taxes with respect to Group Tax Returns.



Section 7.03 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent and Indigo shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any
Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
party\'s request) the provision of records and information which may be
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Contest and making
appropriate persons available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Parent and Indigo shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified, any extensions thereof) of the respective
Taxable periods, and abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Indigo shall not be required to transfer or make available to
Parent any Tax Returns or related books and records and information with
respect to Taxes of Indigo or any of Indigo\'s Affiliates (other than Tax
Returns (or applicable portions thereof) and related books and records and
information of the Company).



Section 7.04 Tax Refunds. Indigo shall be entitled to the amount of any refund
or credit with respect to any Group Tax Returns.



Section 7.05 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use,
registration, value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable
real estate transfer Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby will be borne equally by Parent and Indigo.
Each of Parent and Indigo hereby agrees to file in a timely manner all
necessary documents (including all Tax Returns) as required by Applicable Law
and pay all such amounts for which such Person is so liable in accordance with
the first sentence of this Section 7.05.



Section 7.06 Certain Conduct. Except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent shall not permit or cause the Surviving Corporation to enter
into any transaction outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing
Date after the Effective Time. Except as required by Applicable Law, Parent
shall not and shall not permit or cause the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates (i) to amend, re-file or otherwise modify any previously
filed Tax Return of the Company or (ii) make or change any Tax election
(including any election under Section 338 of the Code or any similar election)
with respect to the Company or the transactions contemplated herein for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period without Indigo\'s prior written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.



Section 7.07 Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax sharing, allocation,
indemnification or similar agreements, arrangements or undertakings in effect,
written or unwritten, between Indigo or any of its Subsidiaries other than the
Company, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall be
terminated before or as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the
Parent, the Company and their Affiliates shall not be bound thereby or have
any liability thereunder.



Section 7.08 Waiver of Loss Carrybacks. To the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, relinquish pursuant to
Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-







21(b)(3)(ii)(B) (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law),
with respect to all net operating losses attributable to the Surviving
Corporation, the portion of the carryback period for which the Surviving
Corporation was a member of a consolidated group of which Indigo or any of its
Affiliates is or was the common parent.

(a) by mutual written agreement of Indigo and Parent;



(b) by either Indigo or Parent, if the Merger has not been consummated on or

any party whose material breach of any provision of this Agreement or failure

the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time;



(c) by either Parent or Indigo, if a Governmental Authority shall have issued
any Order or taken any other action, in each case, which restrains, enjoins or

(d) by Parent, if (i) any representation or warranty of Indigo contained in
this Agreement shall be inaccurate such that the condition set forth in
Section 8.02(a) would not be satisfied or (ii) the covenants or obligations of
Indigo or the Company contained in this Agreement shall have been breached in
any material respect such that the condition set forth in Section 8.02(b)
would not be satisfied; provided, however, that if an inaccuracy or breach is
curable by Indigo or the Company during the 30-day period after Parent
notifies Indigo in writing of the existence of such inaccuracy or breach (the

that the condition set forth in Section 8.03(a) would not be satisfied or (ii)
the covenants or obligations of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and has irrevocably confirmed
in such written notice that all conditions in Section 8.03 have been satisfied
or that Indigo is willing to waive any and all such conditions that have not
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), and (ii) Parent shall not have
agreed to effect the Closing within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
delivery of such notice.



The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01
(other than pursuant to Section 9.01(a)) shall give a notice of such
termination to the other party setting forth the subsection under this Section
9.01 that such party is terminating this Agreement.

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination.



(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01, this Agreement
shall become void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any
Representative, stockholder or Affiliate of such party) to the other party

provision of this Agreement, (ii) solely to the extent provided in Section

shall, in all events, remain bound by and continue to be subject to the
provisions set forth in Section 6.02, this Section 9.02 and Article 10, which

termination fee of 71,750,000.000 in cash (the "Termination Fee"). The
Termination Fee, if applicable, shall be paid by Parent to Indigo by wire
transfer of immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after
the termination of this Agreement. Payment of the Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Indigo and its Affiliates against Parent and any
of its Affiliates, Sponsor, directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents
and other Representatives, successors and assigns (each, a "Parent Related
Party") and the Debt Financing Sources following a termination of this
Agreement, it being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to
pay fees or damages payable pursuant to this Section 9.02(b) on more than one
occasion. The Termination Fee shall be considered liquidated damages (and not
a penalty) for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Indigo or
any other Person in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Letters and
the Debt Financing Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any other matter forming the
basis for such termination, and no Person shall have any rights or Claims
against any of Parent or any Parent Related Party or any Debt Financing Source
relating to this Agreement, the







Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing Documents (and the termination hereof
and thereof) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (and
the abandonment or termination thereof), or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and
neither Parent nor any Parent Related Party nor any Debt Financing Source
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing Documents (and
the termination hereof and thereof) or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith
or therewith. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 9.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement.



ARTICLE 10.

Section 10.03 Remedies; Specific Performance.



(a) Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies. After the Effective Time,
the rights and remedies of the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not
alternative). Solely to the extent that the right of specific performance is
explicitly applicable under the terms of this Sections 10.03(b) and 10.03(c),
each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the other
parties to this Agreement would be irreparably damaged in the event that any
of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore, solely to the
extent that the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under
the terms of this Sections 10.03(b) and 10.03(c), each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby agrees that (a) the parties to this Agreement shall be
entitled to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of
the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the
performance by each other party hereto under this Agreement, (b) the
provisions set forth in Section 9.02(b)(i) are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any party\'s rights to specific enforcement and (c) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without that right, neither Indigo nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. To the extent that the right of specific
performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of this Section 10.03,
each party to this Agreement hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such
suit that the other parties to this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law
and to interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of
injunction or specific performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any
requirement to post any bond or other type of security in connection with
obtaining such relief.



(b) Remedies of Parent.



(i) Specific Performance. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.01, Parent shall be entitled to seek and obtain an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief in the event of a
breach of threatened breach of any of the provisions of this





Agreement by Indigo or the Company in the courts described in Section 10.08
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including
Indigo\'s and the Company\'s obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



(ii) Termination. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01.



(iii) Monetary Remedies. Other than in the case of fraud, in no event shall
Parent have the right to seek or obtain monetary damages from Indigo or any
Indigo Related Party under this Agreement (whether at law or in equity, in
contract, tort or otherwise) other than as provided in Section 9.02 and
Section 10.01.



(c) Remedies of Indigo.



(i) Specific Performance (Non-Closing Covenants). Prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01 and other than as it
relates to the right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (which are governed
by the provisions of Section 10.03(b)(ii)), Indigo shall be entitled to seek
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief in the event of
a breach of threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement by
Parent or Merger Sub in the courts described in Section 10.08 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof.



(ii) Specific Performance (Closing). Prior to a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, Indigo shall be entitled to seek and
obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable remedies to
enforce Parent\'s obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement only in the
event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) Parent and
Merger Sub are required to complete the Closing pursuant to Section 2.03 and
have failed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
within three (3) Business Days following the date the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to Section 2.03; (ii) the conditions set forth in Section
8.01 and Section 8.02 have been satisfied or waived by the applicable party
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing) have been satisfied on the date the Closing
should have been consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement but for
the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (iii) the Debt Financing
(including any financing pursuant to alternative financing that has been
obtained in accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, Section 6.06)
has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded at the Closing; and (iv) Indigo has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Parent that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, and Parent and Merger Sub otherwise comply with
their obligations hereunder, then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.03(b)(ii) shall not in any
way affect the right of Indigo to seek an injunction or specific performance
or other equitable remedies, in each case described in Section 10.03(b)(i),
for obligations other than with respect to the Equity Financing. While Indigo
may pursue both a grant of specific performance to the extent permitted by
this Section 10.03 and the payment of the Termination Fee to the extent
permitted by Section 9.02(b), under no circumstances shall Indigo be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance to require Parent
to consummate the Closing and payment of the Termination Fee. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Indigo or the Company be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent\'s right to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement if the







Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). In no event shall the Company
or Indigo be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this
Agreement other than solely under the specific circumstances and as
specifically set forth in this Section 10.03(b).



(iii) Termination Fee. Prior to the Effective Time, Indigo shall be entitled
to payment of the Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to Section
9.02(b).



(iv) Termination. Prior to the Effective Time, Indigo shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01.



(v) Monetary Remedies. In no event shall Indigo have the right to seek or
obtain monetary damages from Parent or any Parent Related Party under this
Agreement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise) other
than as provided in Section 10.01. In addition to the rights of Parent and
Merger Sub hereunder, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled, at Parent and
Merger Sub\'s sole election, to settle any claims arising from or relating to
this Agreement by agreeing to consummate the Merger in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.



(d) Sole Remedy. The parties acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided
for in this Section 10.03 shall be the parties\' sole and exclusive remedies
for any breaches of this Agreement or any claims relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other
rights, claims and causes of action, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen,
which exist or may arise in the future, that such party may have against the
other party, the Parent Related Parties or the Indigo Related Parties, as the
case may be, arising under or based upon any Law (including any securities
law, common law or otherwise) for any breach of the representations and
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement.



(e) Debt Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the
Debt Commitment Letter to the contrary, in no event shall the Debt Financing
Sources have any liability or obligation to Indigo, the Company or any of
their Subsidiaries or any of their respective equityholders, officers,
directors, employees, agents, controlling persons or assignees or Affiliates
of any of the foregoing relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing Documents, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Debt Financing; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 10.3(e) shall in any
way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Commitment Party under the Debt Commitment Letter or Parent\'s or Merger
Sub\'s obligations under this Agreement. In addition to the rights of Parent
and Merger Sub hereunder, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled, at Parent
and Merger Sub\'s sole election, to settle any claims arising from or relating
to this Agreement by agreeing to consummate the Merger in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement



Section 10.04 Amendments and Waivers.



(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by
each party against whom the waiver is to be effective. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sections 9.02(b), 10.03(e), 10.04,
10.06, 10.08 and 10.09 (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify
the substance of Sections 9.02(b), 10.03(e), 10.04, 10.06, 10.08 and 10.09)
may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that impacts or
is adverse in any respect to the Debt Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the Commitment Party.









(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.



Section 10.05 Expenses; Indebtedness. Except as otherwise provided herein, (a)
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, including
all third-party legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting or other
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated thereby, shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or
expense; provided, that the costs and expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with this Agreement prior to the Closing (including Transaction

number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other

and each of the documents, instruments and agreements delivered in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including each of the
Exhibits and the Disclosure Schedule, and the Transaction Documents,
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.



Section 10.12 Further Assurances. From time to time until the first
anniversary of the Closing, if either Parent or Indigo determines, acting
reasonably and in good faith, that Indigo failed prior to the Closing to
convey or otherwise transfer to the Company any property or asset owned,
leased, used or licensed by Indigo as of immediately prior to the Closing, the
actual conveyance or transfer of which from Indigo to the Company was required
prior to the Closing in order to make the representation or warranty set forth
in Section 3.13(b) to be accurate in all material respects as of the Closing,
then Indigo shall execute and deliver such further instruments of conveyance,
transfer and assignment and take such other action as Parent may reasonably
require to more effectively convey or otherwise transfer to Parent such
property or asset to the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) execute and
deliver such further instruments and take such other action as Indigo may
reasonably require to more effectively assume any liabilities arising under
any such asset that constitutes a Business Contract.

Section 10.13 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an 

acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



Section 10.14 Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to
the performance of this Agreement.
