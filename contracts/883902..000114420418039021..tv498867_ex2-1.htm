(a) Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL and
the DLLCA, at the Effective Time, Panther shall be merged with and into

(b) As early as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger relating
to the Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such
form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of, the DGCL and the DLLCA (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall

liabilities and duties of Neptune and Panther shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the second (2nd) Business Day
after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted herein) of the

by actions taken at the Closing, but subject to the continuing satisfaction or
waiver of all conditions as of the Closing) set forth in _Article VII_, at

to the applicable positions so indicated, subject to and conditioned on
the Effective Time. If prior to the Effective Time, any management appointee
is unwilling or unable to serve in such designated management position as a
result of illness, death, resignation or any other reason, then a replacement
for such person, if any, shall be appointed by Neptune.

  



  

1.5 _Stockholders Agreement_. Prior to the Effective Time, but
with effect only from and after the Effective Time, Neptune shall enter

Islands exempted limited partnership, and Atrium Intermediate Holdings, LLC, a

Article II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF PANTHER AND NEPTUNE

  



  

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Panther, Neptune or the holders of any Panther LLC
Interests or book-entry interests (the " _Holders_ ") or the holders of
Neptune Common Stock, all Equity Interests in or of Panther (including
Panther LLC Interests) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than Panther LLC Interests not entitled to receive
merger consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ , shall be converted into
the right to receive, in the aggregate with respect to all such interests,
58,709,067 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Neptune Common Stock,
collectively, (the " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ "), with each Holder
becoming entitled to receive a number of shares of Neptune Common stock equal
to such Holder's Percentage Interest _multiplied by_ the number of
shares constituting the Aggregate Merger Consideration (" _Per Interest
Merger Consideration_ "). All such Panther LLC Interests that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist and each Holder shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such Panther LLC Interests, except the right to receive the Per
Interest Merger Consideration, without interest. Each Atlas Holder
shall become entitled to receive such Atlas Holder's share of the Per
Interest Merger Consideration only upon such Atlas Holder's submission of an
Atlas LOT to the Surviving Corporation.

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Cancellation and Conversion of Certain Panther LLC Interests_.
Panther LLC Interests held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Panther
immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and each holder of
such interests shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
Panther LLC Interests.

  



  

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the Execution Date and the
Effective Time, any change in the number or type of outstanding shares of
Neptune Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
combination or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend, stock
distribution or other similar event with a record date during such period,
the number of shares constituting the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto
to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to
undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

2.2 _Issuance of Aggregate Merger Consideration_. At the Closing,
Neptune shall deliver to each Holder such Holder's Per Interest Merger
Consideration in Neptune Common Stock, in book-entry form, together with an
executed certificate of the transfer agent of Neptune certifying as to the
book-entry issuance thereof. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
interests in Neptune or book-entry credit of the same will be issued.

  



  

2.3 _LLC Interest Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
applicable transfer books of Panther shall be closed with respect to Panther
LLC Interests and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Panther LLC Interests theretofore outstanding on the records of
Panther.

  



  

2.4 _Withholding_. Neptune, Panther and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of local, state, federal, or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by Neptune, Panther or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Neptune, Panther or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

  



  

2.5 _Reorganization Treatment_. It is intended that for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and this
Agreement is hereby adopted as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

  



  

Article III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF NEPTUNE

  



  

Except as (a) disclosed in the Neptune SEC Documents publicly filed with or
publicly furnished to the SEC on or after January 1, 2017 and prior to
the Execution Date (excluding any disclosures included in any "risk factor"
or "forward looking information" section of such Neptune SEC Documents) or
(b) set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to Panther on the Execution
Date (the " _Neptune Disclosure Letter_ "), which identifies items of
disclosure by reference to a particular section or subsection of this
Agreement ( _provided_ that any information set forth in one section of the
Neptune Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to each other section or
subsection thereof or hereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent),
Neptune hereby represents and warrants to Panther as follows:

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

3.1 _Organization; Qualification_. Each Neptune Entity is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each Neptune Entity (a) has all
requisite organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its
assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and (b) is duly qualified, registered or licensed to do business
as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure
to be so duly qualified, registered or licensed and in good standing would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Neptune Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of Neptune to perform its obligations under this Agreement
or the Transactions. Neptune has made available to Panther true and complete
copies of the Organizational Documents of each Neptune Entity, as in effect
on the Execution Date. There has been no violation of any of the provisions
of the Organizational Documents of each Neptune Entity, and no Neptune Entity
has taken any action that is inconsistent in any material respect with any
resolution adopted by such entity's members, board of directors or board of
managers (or other similar body) or any committee of the board of directors
or board of managers (or other similar body) of such entity. Section 3.1 of
the Neptune Disclosure Letter sets forth each Neptune Entity.

  



  

3.2 _Authority; Enforceability_.

  



  

(a) Neptune has the requisite power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and, subject
to receipt of the Neptune Stockholder Approval, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements.
The execution and delivery by Neptune of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements and the consummation by Neptune of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements have been
duly and validly authorized by Neptune, and, except for the Neptune
Stockholder Approval, no other proceedings on the part of Neptune or its
stockholders is necessary to authorize this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements or to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements. The Neptune Board has, by
unanimous vote of the Transaction Directors, (i) declared it advisable to
enter into this Agreement, (ii) determined that this Agreement, the
Transactions and the terms of the Stockholders Agreement and the Registration
Rights Agreement are fair and in the best interests of Neptune and its
stockholders, (iii) approved this Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement, the
Registration Rights Agreement and the Transactions and (iv) determined to
recommend that the holders of Neptune Common Stock vote to approve the
Transactions and adopt this Agreement (the " _Neptune Recommendation_ "). No
Neptune stockholders or other holders of Equity Interests of Neptune have any
dissenters' rights or rights of appraisal relating to the Transactions or the
Transaction Agreements.

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) This Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements have been,
or, in the case of the Transaction Agreements to be delivered after
the Execution Date, will be, duly executed and delivered by Neptune, and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Panther Entities,
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the valid and
binding obligation of Neptune, enforceable against Neptune in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally
and subject, as to enforceability, to legal principles of general
applicability governing the availability of equitable remedies,
including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair
dealing (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law) (collectively, " _Creditors ' Rights_").

  



  

3.3 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements by Neptune and, subject
to the receipt of the Neptune Stockholder Approval, the consummation by
Neptune of the Transactions do not and will not (a) result in any breach or
violation of any provision of the Organizational Documents of any Neptune
Entity; (b) constitute a default (or an Event that with notice or passage of
time or both would give rise to a default) under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration (with or without the
giving of notice, or the passage of time or both) under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any Contract to which any Neptune Entity is a
party or by which any property or asset of any Neptune Entity is bound or
affected; (c) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in _Section
3.4_, violate any Law to which any Neptune Entity is subject or by which any
Neptune Entity's properties or assets are bound; or (d) constitute (with or
without the giving of notice or the passage of time or both) an Event which
would result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) on any asset of any Neptune Entity, except, in the cases of
clauses (b), (c) and (d), for such defaults or rights of termination,
cancellation, amendment, acceleration, violations or Encumbrances as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Neptune
Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the ability of Neptune to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

3.4 _Approvals of Governmental Entities and Third Parties_. No
declaration, filing or registration with, or notice to, or
authorization, consent or approval of, any Person or Governmental Entity is
necessary for the consummation by Neptune of the Transactions, other than (a)
filings and clearances required under the HSR Act, the Competition Act of
Canada and the Austrian Cartel Act, (b) in connection or in compliance with
the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, (c) applicable state securities and
"blue sky" Laws, (d) the Neptune Stockholder Approval and (e) such
declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or
approvals which, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Neptune Material Adverse Effect or
to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Neptune to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or the Transactions.

related thereto, a " _Neptune Real Property Lease_ "). A Neptune Entity has a
valid leasehold or subleasehold (as applicable) interest in all Neptune Leased
Real Property, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except Permitted

effect of any applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential
transfers, or similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect of general

Adverse Effect.

  



  

(c) The Neptune Entities are not in default or otherwise in breach
under any Neptune Real Property Lease and, to the Knowledge of Neptune, no
other party is in default or otherwise in breach thereof, except for breaches

Lease has notified the Neptune Entity party thereto in writing that it is
exercising any termination right with respect thereto, and, to the Knowledge
of Neptune, there is no outstanding dispute, oral agreement or forbearance
program in effect with respect to any Neptune Real Property Lease, except as

this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements by Panther and the
consummation by Panther of the Transactions do not and will not: (a) result

is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific

to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y) any
fraud, known to such officers, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Panther's
internal controls. The principal executive officer and the
principal financial officer of Ply Gem Holdings, Inc. made all certifications

the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, (b)
through the Execution Date, no Panther Entity has taken or agreed to take any

Panther, written notice terminating (or expressly stating the intent
to terminate) such customer's or supplier's relationship with any Panther
Entity.

  



  

4.22 _Financing_. A true and complete copy of the Debt Commitment
Letter as in effect as of the date hereof has been provided to Neptune,
together with a true and complete copy of the fee letter relating to the Debt
Commitment Letter (the " _Fee Letter_ "). As of the date hereof, the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter are in full force and effect and are the
legal, valid and binding enforceable obligation of Panther Midco, and, to the
knowledge of Panther, each of the parties thereto, in accordance with the
terms and conditions thereof, except to the extent that enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally, or by principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies. As of the date hereof, and after
giving _pro forma_ effect to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter,
assuming that the Payment Condition (as defined in the Existing Panther ABL
Credit Facility) is met on the Closing Date, the consummation of the Financing
on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter will not conflict with
the Existing Panther Credit Facilities or the Existing Panther Indenture. As
of the date hereof, (a) no event has occurred, which, with or without notice
or lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute
a default or breach on the part of Panther Midco or, to the knowledge of
Panther, any other party thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee
Letter and (b) assuming the truth and accuracy of the representations set
forth in _Article III_, Panther has no reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy the conditions precedent to the consummation of the
Financing contained in the Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied by it.

  



  

4.23 _Warranties/Product Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) All products that have been licensed, leased, developed,
manufactured, marketed, sold or distributed by any Panther Entity (the "
_Panther Products_ "); conform with (i) all applicable contractual
commitments and all applicable warranties; (ii) the product
specifications published by Panther; and (iii) regulations, certification
standards and other requirements of any applicable Governmental Entity or
third party, in each case, other than warranty claims in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice and, except as would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Panther Material
Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) Since January 1, 2016, (i) there have not been, and currently
are no, defects or deficiencies in the Panther Products that have had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Panther Material Adverse Effect and
(ii) there has not been, nor is there under consideration by any Panther
Entity, any recall, market withdrawal or replacement, safety alert,
notification to any Governmental Entity or post-sale warning of a material
nature concerning any Panther Product.

4.24 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in _Article III_, Panther agrees
and acknowledges that neither Neptune, nor any Person on behalf of the
Neptune, makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to Neptune or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other
information provided or made available to Panther in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions, including information conveyed at
management presentations, in virtual data rooms or in due diligence sessions
and, without limiting the foregoing, including any estimates, projections,
predictions or other forward-looking information, and Neptune shall not have
any liability to Panther resulting from Panther's reliance on any such
information.

which such Neptune Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and any
other material documents (including financing commitments, if any) and
correspondence in respect thereof, including the identity of the Person making
such proposal), and, that Neptune intends to take such action at the end of
the notice period, which notice shall specify the basis for such Neptune
Recommendation Change (such notice being referred to herein as a " _Neptune
SP Recommendation Change Notice_ "), and (2) following such five (5)-Business
Day period, the Special Committee after taking into account in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Panther
and, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, shall have determined in good faith that the Neptune Alternative
Proposal remains a Neptune Superior Proposal; each time
material modifications to the terms of a Neptune Alternative Proposal
determined to be a Neptune Superior Proposal are made a new Neptune SP
Recommendation Change Notice shall be required, and in such case, the time
periods specified in the foregoing clauses (1) and (2) with respect to the
new notice shall be three (3) Business Days.

  



  

(iii) the Neptune Board (acting through the Transaction Directors) or
the Special Committee may make a Neptune Recommendation Change of the type
described in clause (i) or (ii) of the definition thereof in response to a
Neptune Intervening Event if prior to taking such action the Special
Committee reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Neptune
Board or the Special Committee to make such Neptune Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the Neptune Board's or the Special Committee's
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
effecting such Neptune Recommendation Change (A) Neptune shall have given
Panther at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice informing
Panther that Neptune has determined that a Neptune Intervening Event has
occurred or arisen (which notice will reasonably describe such Neptune
Intervening Event) and Neptune intends to effect a Neptune Recommendation
Change at the end of the notice period (such notice being referred to herein
as a " _Neptune Recommendation Change Notice_ "), (B) during the five
(5)-Business Day period starting after the date on which such Neptune
Recommendation Change Notice is received, if requested by Panther, Neptune
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, negotiate in
good faith with Panther and Panther's Representatives (to the extent Panther
wishes to negotiate), which may be on a nonexclusive basis with respect to
negotiations or discussions permitted by this _Section 6.1_ , to revise the
terms and conditions of this Agreement such that a failure of the Neptune
Board or the Special Committee to effect such a Neptune Recommendation Change
in response to such Neptune Intervening Event would not be inconsistent with
the Neptune Board's or the Special Committee's fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (C) following such five (5)-Business Day period after the
date of the Neptune Recommendation Change Notice, the Special Committee after
taking into account in good faith any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Panther and, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, shall have reasonably determined in good faith
that the failure to effect such a Neptune Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the Neptune Board's or the Special Committee's fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company that is required by Law or (iii) making any "stop,
look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that this

or _Section 6.1(d)_.

  



  

(f) From and after the Execution Date, Panther and the Sponsor (i)

6.2 _Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Execution Date,
Neptune shall prepare and file or cause to be filed with the SEC, the
Proxy Statement in order to seek the Neptune Stockholder Approval. Panther
shall (x) cooperate with Neptune in the preparation of the Proxy Statement;
(y) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish the information required by the
SEC or federal securities Laws to be included in the Proxy Statement
concerning the Panther Entities, including updated financial statements if
required and (z) use its reasonable best efforts to provide such other

outside legal counsel in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement. Neptune shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as is
practicable after filing and each of Neptune and Panther shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
holders of Neptune Common Stock as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Proxy Statement shall have been cleared by the SEC. Each party shall also
take any action required to be taken and make any necessary filings under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with the Transactions, this Agreement or the issuance of Neptune
Common Stock in the Transactions. All filings by Neptune with the SEC in
connection with the Transactions and all mailings to the stockholders of
Neptune in connection with the Transactions shall be subject to the
reasonable opportunity for prior review and comment by Panther, which comments
Neptune shall consider in good faith, acting reasonably.

  



    

 | 47| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any party discovers
any information relating to Panther or Neptune, or any of their
respective Affiliates, directors or officers that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement Proxy Statement so that such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party and Neptune shall promptly
cause to be filed with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate
such information to the stockholders of Neptune.

  



  

(c) The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of
any correspondence, communications or comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply each other with (i) copies of all correspondence and a description of
all material oral discussions between it or any of its respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Transactions and (ii)
copies of all orders of the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement.

  



  

6.3 _Stockholders Meeting; Recommendations_. Neptune shall take, in
accordance with the DGCL and its Organizational Documents, all
actions reasonably necessary to mail the Proxy Statement to Neptune's
stockholders and to establish a record date, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Neptune Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of securing
the Neptune Stockholder Approval. Unless a Neptune Recommendation Change is
effected in accordance with _Section 6.1_ , the Proxy Statement shall state
that the Neptune Board has, by unanimous vote of the Transaction Directors,
(i) approved this Agreement and the Transactions; (ii) determined that this
Agreement and the Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of
Neptune and its stockholders; and (iii) include the Neptune Recommendation.
Unless a Neptune Recommendation Change is effected in accordance with _Section
6.1_ , Neptune shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from
stockholders of Neptune votes in favor of the Neptune Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding any Neptune Recommendation Change, this Agreement shall be
submitted to the stockholders of Neptune at the Neptune Stockholder Meeting
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Neptune of such
obligation unless this Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to the
terms hereof. In addition to the foregoing, Neptune shall not submit to the
vote of its stockholders any Neptune Alternative Proposal or other
acquisition proposal other than the Transactions. Anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement notwithstanding, Neptune may adjourn or postpone
the Neptune Stockholder Meeting (A) to the extent necessary, to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that Neptune has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) is
necessary under applicable Law, is provided to Neptune's stockholders, (B) if,
as of the time for which the meeting of Neptune's stockholders is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient
shares of Neptune Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such meeting or (C) with
the consent of Panther, to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the
Neptune Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that no adjournment or
postponement may be made to a date on or after three (3) Business Days prior
to the End Date.

6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) From the Execution Date until the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, (i) Neptune shall provide and shall cause
Neptune's Representatives to provide Panther and its authorized
Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice, such reasonable access to the offices, employees, customers,
suppliers, properties, books and records of Neptune and its Subsidiaries (so
long as such access does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of
Neptune and its Subsidiaries) as Panther may reasonably request, and (ii)
Panther shall provide and shall cause Panther's Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to provide Neptune and its authorized
Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice, such reasonable access to the offices, employees, properties,
books and records of the Panther Entities (so long as such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of any Panther Entities) as Neptune
may reasonably request (including for the purposes of planning the operation
of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time). No party shall have
access to personnel records of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories
or other information that in such other party's good faith opinion the
disclosure of which could subject such other party or any of its Subsidiaries
to risk of liability.

  



  

(b) With respect to any information disclosed pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_, each of Panther and Neptune shall comply with, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to comply
with, all of its obligations under the mutual nondisclosure and
confidentiality agreement, dated June 7, 2018, previously executed by Panther
and Neptune (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). No party shall be required
to provide access to or disclose any information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of such party or
any Subsidiary of such party or contravene any Contract, Law or order (it
being agreed that the parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not
result in such jeopardy or contravention).

  



  

6.5 _Efforts to Consummate; Notification_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
party will use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Transactions,
including using reasonable best efforts to (and, with respect to the following
clauses (i), (ii) and (iv), Sponsor shall and shall cause the Funds to use
their respective reasonable best efforts to) (i) cause the conditions
precedent set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied; _provided_ , that in
the case of Sponsor, its obligations under this clause (i) shall only require
that Sponsor (A) use reasonable best efforts to cause the condition set forth
in _Section 7.3(c)_ to be satisfied and _(B)_ not take or fail to take any
action, and cause the Funds not to take or fail to take any action, with the
intention of preventing, frustrating or delaying the satisfaction of the
condition set forth in _Section 7.2(d)_ , (ii) obtain all necessary waivers,
consents, approvals, permits, orders or authorizations (including the
expiration or termination of any waiting periods) from Governmental Entities
and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings
(including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and take all steps as may be necessary to avoid, or to have
terminated, if begun, any Proceeding by any Governmental Entity by the End
Date, (iii) obtain all necessary waivers, consents, approvals, permits,
orders or authorizations from third parties, (iv) defend any investigations or
Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to avoid the entry
of, or to have reversed, terminated, lifted or vacated, any stay, temporary
restraining order or other injunctive relief or order entered by any
Governmental Entity that could prevent or delay the Transactions or the
consummation of the Transactions and (v) execute and deliver additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Neptune,
Sponsor and Panther shall, and the Sponsor shall cause the Funds to, (i) make
or cause to be made any filings required under the HSR Act, the Competition
Act of Canada and the Austrian Cartel Act with respect to the Transaction as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and, with respect to filings under the HSR
Act, in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after, the Execution Date,
(ii) furnish to any other parties as promptly as reasonably practicable all
information required for any application or other filing to be made by the
other party pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the
Transactions, (iii) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
inquiries received from, and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information or documentation that may be requested by, the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or by any other Governmental Entity
in respect of such registrations, declarations and filings or such
transactions, (iv) promptly notify the other parties of any communication
between that party and the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity and
of any material communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding the application of a
Regulatory Law to any of the Transactions and (v) act in good faith and use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the other parties in connection
with any such registrations, declarations and filings and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any such agency or other
Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law with respect
to any such registration, declaration and filing or any such transaction.
Anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.5(b)_ notwithstanding,
materials provided to the other parties or its outside counsel may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of Neptune and its
Subsidiaries or Panther Entities or as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.5_
shall require, or be construed to require, (i) any Panther Entity or any
Neptune Entity to agree to (A) sell, divest, discontinue, hold separate or
limit any assets, businesses or interests, (B) terminate, modify, or create
any ventures, (C) terminate or modify any existing relationships, contractual
rights or obligations, (D) effectuate any other changes or restructurings,
(E) create any contractual rights or obligations or firewalls, (F) refrain
from making any investment or acquisition or (G) any conditions relating to,
or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets, businesses
or interests, in each case of the foregoing clauses (A) through (G), to the
extent that such actions individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Neptune, Panther, or the
Surviving Corporation, or (ii) subject to clause (i), Sponsor or any of its
Affiliates, other than the Funds and other than the Panther Entities and
the Neptune Entities (both of which are addressed by clause (i)), to agree to
any of the actions or matters referred to in clauses (i)(A)-(G) of this
_Section 6.5(c)_.

6.6   _Certain Notices_.

  



  

(a) Panther and Neptune shall each promptly advise the other party
of (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions or (b) upon receiving any communication from any Governmental
Entity or third party whose consent or approval is required for consummation
of the Transactions that causes such party to believe that there is a
reasonable likelihood that any such consent or approval will not be obtained
or that the receipt of any such consent or approval will be materially
delayed.

  



  

6.7 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to this Agreement and the Transactions shall be a release mutually agreed
upon by Panther and Neptune. Thereafter, Panther and Neptune shall consult
with each other and provide each other with the opportunity to review and
comment upon any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions or this Agreement and shall not issue any such other press
release prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law or any listing agreement related to the trading of the shares
of either party on any securities exchange, in which case the party proposing
to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use
reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party and
provide the other party with an opportunity to review and comment on the
content of the proposed disclosure, which comments such party shall consider
in good faith, acting reasonably, before issuing any such press release
or making any such public announcement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
each of Panther and Neptune may make press releases, public statements or
public announcements concerning this Agreement or the Transactions that
consist solely of information previously disclosed in press releases, public
disclosures or statements made by Neptune and/or Panther in compliance with
this _Section 6.7_ and (b) Neptune shall not be required to provide for
review or comment to Panther any statement, release or disclosure in response
to or in connection with a Neptune Alternative Proposal or Neptune
Recommendation Change, it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that
nothing in this clause (b) shall permit Neptune to make any statement or
effect a Neptune Recommendation Change other than in accordance with _Section
6.1(b)_ or _Section 6.1(d)_.

6.8 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in
respect of each), in the same manner as provided by Panther, as applicable,
immediately prior to the Execution Date, each present and former director,
officer and employee of Panther, or any of their respective Subsidiaries (in
all of their capacities (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or employee of
the Panther Entities or Neptune Entities, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time (including with respect to acts or
omissions by directors or officers of Neptune or Panther or their
respective Subsidiaries in their capacities as such arising in connection
with the Transactions), and shall provide advancement of expenses to the
Indemnified Parties, in all such cases to the same extent that such persons
are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the
Execution Date by Panther pursuant to Panther's Organizational Documents and
indemnification agreements, if any, or by any one of Panther's Subsidiaries
pursuant to such Subsidiary's Organizational Documents and
indemnification agreements of any Subsidiary of Panther, if any, in existence
on the Execution Date.

  



  

(b) Neptune agrees that, for six (6) years after the Effective
Time, the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification of the
current and former directors and officers of Panther than are provided by
Panther in Panther's Organizational Documents and indemnification agreements
as of the Execution Date, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individuals until the expiration of the statutes of
limitations applicable to such matters or unless such amendment, modification
or repeal is required by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect for the benefit of the Indemnified
Parties an insurance and indemnification policy with an insurer with the same
or better credit rating as the current carrier for Panther that provides
coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each such person covered by the officers' and directors' liability insurance
policy of Panther on terms with respect to coverage and in amounts no less
favorable in the aggregate than those of Panther's directors' and officers'
insurance policy in effect on the Execution Date;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid
by Panther for such coverage; and _provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that
if any annual premium for such insurance coverage exceeds 300% of such annual
premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for a cost not exceeding such amount. The Surviving
Corporation's obligations under this _Section 6.8(c)_ may be satisfied by
the Surviving Corporation purchasing a "tail" policy, under Panther's
existing directors, and officers, insurance policy, which (i) has an effective
term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers each person
covered by Panther's directors' and officers' insurance policy in effect on
the Execution Date or at the Effective Time for actions and omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time and (iii) contains terms that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than those of Panther's directors' and
officers' insurance policy in effect on the Execution Date. If such "tail"
policy has been obtained by Neptune prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation.

  



    

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_, are (i) intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or
otherwise. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity obligations provided in this
_Section 6.8_ unless it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to such indemnity.

  



  

(e) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, if the Surviving
Corporation, or any of its successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation honor the indemnification obligations set forth
in this _Section 6.8_.

  



  

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date,
Neptune shall or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to provide each
Continuing Neptune Employee and each Continuing Panther Employee whose
employment is terminated without cause during the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date
with severance benefits equal in value to the greater of (i) the severance
benefits that such individual would be eligible to receive under the
applicable severance policy, program or arrangement of any Panther Entity set
forth on Section 6.9(a) of the Panther Disclosure Letter and (ii) the
severance benefits that such individual would be eligible to receive under
the severance policy, program or arrangement of any Neptune Entity set forth
on Section 6.9(a) of the Neptune Disclosure Letter, in each case, taking into
account such Continuing Panther Employee's service with the Panther Entities
prior to the Closing and with the Neptune Entities following the Closing and
such Continuing Neptune Employee's service with the Neptune Entities prior to
and following the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, during the one (1)-year period referred to in
the immediately preceding sentence, each Continuing Neptune Employee and
Continuing Panther Employee that is party to an individual agreement with
Neptune or Panther that provides for severance benefits shall receive
severance benefits pursuant to his or her individual agreement.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, Neptune shall give each Continuing
Panther Employee full credit for all purposes under any employee
benefit plans sponsored, maintained or contributed to by any Neptune Entity
for such Continuing Panther Employee's service with any Panther Entity and
with any predecessor employer to the same extent recognized prior to the
Closing under a corresponding Panther Benefit Plan; _provided_ that the
foregoing service recognition shall not apply (i) to the extent such credit
would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service,
(ii) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan
or retiree welfare plan or (iii) for purposes of any benefit plan that is
frozen or provides grandfathered benefits. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (A) Neptune shall, or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiaries to, provide that each Continuing Panther Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in
any and all Neptune Benefit Plans, and (B) (1) for purposes of each Neptune
Benefit Plan in which a Continuing Panther Employee participates during the
year in which the Closing Date occurs that provides medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits, Neptune (or its applicable Subsidiaries)
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Neptune Benefit Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Panther Employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the
analogous Panther Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Panther
Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing and (2) Neptune shall,
or cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Panther Benefit
Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in a corresponding
Neptune Benefit Plan begins to be taken into account under such Neptune
Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such Neptune Benefit Plan.

  



    

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Neptune and Panther agree to the covenants set forth on Section
6.9(c) of the Panther Disclosure Letter.

  



  

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, Panther shall seek approval by the
Holders, in accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, of the
right of any "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c)
of the Code and the regulations thereunder) to receive or retain any payments
that would, in the absence of such stockholder approval, constitute "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Prior to
seeking such approval, Panther will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from each disqualified individual waivers that provide that no payments
and/or benefits that would separately or in the aggregate constitute "excess
parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code ("
_Parachute Payments_ ") with respect to such disqualified individual shall,
in the absence of such Holder approval referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence, be payable to or retained by such disqualified individual
to the extent such Parachute Payments would not be deductible by reason of
the application of Section 280G of the Code or would result in the imposition
of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code on such disqualified
individual. All materials produced by Panther in connection with the
implementation of this _Section 6.9(d)_ shall be provided to Neptune at least
five (5) Business Days in advance for Neptune's review and comment, and
Panther shall consider any of Neptune's requested changes or comments in good
faith and not unreasonably omit them; _provided_ that if any compensatory
arrangement is entered into between a Neptune Entity and a disqualified
individual before the Closing, Neptune shall provide a copy of such
arrangement or summary of its material terms to Panther at least ten
(10) Business Days before the Closing and shall cooperate with Panther and
its advisers in good faith to determine the value for the purposes of Section
280G of the Code of any payments or benefits contemplated therein and if
Neptune does not comply with its obligations under this sentence, Panther's
failure to include such Neptune arrangements in the Holder voting materials
described herein will not result in a breach of this _Section 6.9(d)_.

  



    

 | 54| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Without limiting _Section 11.6_, nothing in this Agreement
shall constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, any employee
benefit plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by any Person. The
provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are for the sole benefit of the parties
hereto and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be
construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Continuing Panther Employee or Continuing Neptune Employee or
other current or former employee (or spouse or dependent thereof) of Neptune,
Panther or any of their respective Subsidiaries, other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns), any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters
provided for in this _Section 6.9_) under or by reason of any provision of
this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall give any employee or other
service provider of Neptune, Panther or any of their respective Affiliates or
any other Person any right to continued employment or service.

  



  

6.10 _ Section 16(b) Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Neptune
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any disposition of
Equity Interests of Neptune (including derivative securities with respect
thereto) or acquisition of Equity Interests of the Surviving Corporation

11.2 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or

adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

11.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the
Neptune Disclosure Letter, the Panther Disclosure Letter and the
other documents delivered pursuant hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, or

hereunder, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other parties of any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise of any right hereunder. No agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any extension or waiver shall be valid, unless set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Effective Time shall occur) and (ii) as set forth in _Section 11.13_ with
respect to the Financing Parties.

(including by waiver or consent) from time to time in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof. When calculating the period of time before which,
within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant
to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such
period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is not a Business
Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day.
References to any period of days will be deemed to be to the relevant number
of calendar days, unless otherwise specified.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN, AND IN ALL
RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE

Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect
of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense
in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement of
this Agreement or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such
action, proceeding or transactions shall be heard and determined in such a
Delaware state or federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any
such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that

proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 11.1_ or in such other manner

MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND

referred to herein are hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof for
all purposes as if fully set forth herein. The statements in the Neptune
Disclosure Letter and Panther Disclosure Letter relate to the provisions in
the section of this Agreement to which they expressly relate; _provided_ ,

and (iii) shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission to any third
party concerning such item.

  



  

11.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
each would be irreparably damaged in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached and that any non-performance or breach of this
Agreement by any party could not be adequately compensated by money damages
alone and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law. Each
party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any
other party of any provisions contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching
party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages, except
as limited by _Section 8.4_) to seek and to obtain a decree or order of
specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
provisions, and an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 11.10_, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. The parties further agree that they shall not object to the
granting of any injunctive relief on the basis that an adequate remedy at law
may exist.

11.12 _Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, and
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including _Section 11.13_
 below, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a
written instrument executed and delivered by all the parties whether before
or after approval of the Merger or the other Transactions; _provided_ ,

which applicable Law or the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires
further approval by stockholders or members without such further approval.

  



  

11.13 _Financing Parties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, each of the parties hereto on its own behalf and on behalf
of its Subsidiaries hereby: (a) agree that any Proceeding, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the
Financing Parties, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the
Financing or any of the agreements (including the Debt Commitment Letter)

remains available, and any appellate court thereof and each party hereto
irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (b) agrees that any
such Proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York
(without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would result
in the application of the laws of another state), (c) agrees not to bring or

any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Party in any way arising out of or

of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in the
Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (d) irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such court, (e) knowingly,
intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law trial by jury in any Proceeding brought against the Financing
Parties in any way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the

hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, (f) agrees
that none of the Financing Parties will have any liability to any of the
parties hereto or their respective Affiliates relating to or arising out of

contract, in tort or otherwise, other than, with respect to the parties
thereto, pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement
entered into in connection with the Financing, and no party hereto nor any of
their respective Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of the
Financing Parties hereunder, (g) agrees the Financing Parties are express
third-party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions in this
Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements and (h) agrees that none of
_Section 11.6_ , _Section 11.12_ , this _Section 11.13_ or the definition of
"Financing Parties" (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent
an amendment or waiver of such provision would modify the substance of any of
the foregoing provisions) shall be amended, waived, supplemented or otherwise
modified in any way adverse to the Financing Parties without the prior
written consent of the Committed Lenders.
