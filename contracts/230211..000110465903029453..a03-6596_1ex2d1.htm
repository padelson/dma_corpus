 _Section 2.03_ _.  Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and
Officers. _(a) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the
part of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, the certificate of incorporation of
the Company shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving

applicable law.

of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the

(i) except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.04(a)(ii) and 2.06, each Share
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Amount in cash (the " **Merger
Consideration** "), without interest;

  



  

(ii) each Share held by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto; and

  



  

10      
   



  

(iii) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) The aggregate Merger Consideration shall be (i) the sum of $2,400,000,000
plus any Remaining Cash plus the Option Benefit, (ii) minus, without
duplication, the Funded Debt, the Option Amount and the Supplemental Option
Amount (" **Aggregate Merger Consideration** ").

  



  

The Per Share Amount shall be the quotient of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration _divided by_ the number of Primary Shares.

  



  

" **Additional Amount** " means the sum of:

  



  

(i) the product of (x) the number of Shares issued or deemed to be issued in
respect of or exchange for Company Stock Options and Deferred Shares during
December 2003 (excluding any such Shares withheld by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in respect of withholding tax obligations or for repayment
of any Stockholder Loan Agreement) and (y) the greater of $37.40 and the Per
Share Amount;

  



  

(ii) the product of (x) the number of any such Shares referred to in the
foregoing clause (i)(x) of this definition withheld by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in respect of withholding tax obligations or for repayment
of any Stockholder Loan Agreement and (y) $37.40; and

  



  

(iii) the product (such product, the " **Supplemental Option Amount** ") of
(x) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over $37.40 and (y) the
number of Company Stock Options and Deferred Shares canceled or exercised in
connection with clause (i) of this definition, _less_  the number of Shares
actually received (after giving effect to the withholding of Shares referred
to in clause (ii)(x) of this definition) by the holders of such Company Stock
Options or Deferred Shares in respect of such cancellations or exercises,
subject to any Plan Payment Cap.

  



  

" **Option Amount** " means the sum of (i) the aggregate positive
differences between the Per Share Amount and the exercise price of each
Company Stock Option and (ii) the product of the number of Deferred Shares
and the Per Share Amount in each case, as of the Effective Time, _minus_ any
reduction in payments of Option Consideration resulting from any Plan Payment
Cap. The Per Share Amount used in the calculation of the Option Amount shall
be equal to the Per Share Amount to be paid pursuant to this Agreement in
respect of each outstanding Share.

  



  

11      
   



  

" **Option Benefit** " means (i) 35% of the sum of the Option Amount and the

other securities convertible or exchangeable into Shares).

  



  

" **Remaining Cash** " means the aggregate of cash balances and cash
equivalents of the Company as of the close of business two Business Days
prior to the Effective Time as determined in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

Section 2.04(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an example of
the calculation of the Per Share Amount based on specified assumptions.

  



  

 _Section 2.05_ _.  Surrender and Payment. _(a) __ At or before 5:00 p.m.
Eastern time on the Business Day prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a statement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, certified by the chief financial officer of the
Company (the " **Statement** "), setting forth the Remaining Cash, the Option
Amount, the Supplemental Option Amount, the Company Expenses, the Funded Debt
and the Primary Shares, in each case (other than the Remaining Cash)
calculated as of the Effective Time, quantifying in reasonable detail the
items constituting such amounts and providing such evidence thereof as Parent
may reasonably request, together with a calculation of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration as of the Effective Time. Upon delivery of the Statement
by the Company, the Company shall provide Parent and its representatives
with access to the officers, employees, agreements, and books and records of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in order to allow Parent and
its representatives to verify the accuracy of such amounts.

  



  

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall contribute cash to
Merger Sub in an amount equal to the sum of the Option Amount, the
Supplemental Option Amount and the amount of Funded Debt to be paid off at
Closing. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to repay such portion of the Funded Debt as of
the Effective Time as Parent shall determine (it being understood that any
election by Parent not to repay a portion of the Funded Debt shall not alter
the calculation of the aggregate Merger Consideration). Parent and the
Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers of or
consents with respect to any Funded Debt to the extent such Funded Debt is
not repaid in full at Closing and such waivers or consents are necessary as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each former holder of a Company Stock Option or
Deferred Share canceled or exercised in connection with clause (i) of the
definition of Additional Amount an amount in cash determined by multiplying
(i) the excess (if any) of the Per Share Amount

  



  

12      
   



  

over $37.40 by (ii) the number of shares of Voting Company Stock underlying
such Company Stock Option or Deferred Share _less_ the number of any Shares
actually received (after giving effect to the withholding of Shares referred
to in clause (ii)(x) of the definition of Additional Amount) by the former
holder of such Company Stock Option or Deferred Share in respect of such
cancellation or exercise, subject in each case to any Plan Payment Cap.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall appoint The
Bank of New York as an agent (the " **Exchange Agent** ") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares
of Company Stock (the " **Certificates** ") or (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Stock (the " **Uncertificated Shares** "). Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall make available by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Exchange Agent the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the
Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall
send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares
to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.  The letter of transmittal
shall be in a form mutually agreeable to the Company and Parent and shall
provide for the payment of any outstanding balances under the Stockholder
Loan Agreement out of the proceeds otherwise payable to the relevant
Stockholder. Section 2.05(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the
aggregate amount of available credit under the Stockholder Loan Agreement,
each Stockholder with an outstanding balance under the Stockholder Loan
Agreement, the amount of such balance and the number of Shares held by such
Stockholder, in each case as of November 30, 2003.

  



  

(d) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, at or following the
Closing, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share.
 Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective
Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

  



  

(e) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any

  



  

13      
   



  

transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(f) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for,
and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

  



  

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this Section 2.05 that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Shares six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.05
prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions
with respect thereto, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares two years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental
authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

 _Section 2.06_. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.04,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with
Delaware Law shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such Shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

  



  

 _Section 2.07_ _.  Stock Options and Deferred Shares.  _(a) Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Voting Company
Stock outstanding under any compensation plan or arrangement of the Company
or its

  



  

14      
   



  

Subsidiaries or otherwise outstanding (each such option, a " **Company Stock
Option** ") and each Deferred Share shall be canceled, and each holder of any
such Company Stock Option (other than the Home Run Options) or Deferred
Shares, shall be entitled to receive from the Company (subject to any Plan
Payment Cap), an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) in the case of
the Company Stock Options, the excess (if any) of the Per Share Amount over
the exercise price of such Company Stock Option and in the case of the
Deferred Shares, the Per Share Amount by (ii) the number of shares of Voting
Company Stock underlying such Company Stock Option or Deferred Share (such
amount, the " **Option Consideration** "). All such payments will be subject
to the terms and conditions of the plans or agreements with respect to which
such options or shares were issued, including, but not limited to applicable
tax withholding requirements. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time
all Home Run Options shall be cancelled pursuant to their terms without any
consideration being payable to the holder thereof.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, to the extent necessary
to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.07, (i)
obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock Options and Deferred Shares
and (ii) make amendments to the terms of the Companys stock option or
compensation plans or arrangements. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 2.07, payment may be withheld in respect of any Company Stock
Option or Deferred Share until such necessary consents are obtained.

  



  

 _Section 2.08_ _.  Adjustments. _If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

  



  

 _Section 2.09_ _.  Withholding Rights. _Each of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign law. If the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of which
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction
and withholding.

  



  

 _Section 2.10_ _.  Lost Certificates. _If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim

  



  

15      
   



  

that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 3** ** 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

The Company represents and warrants to Parent that except as set forth in the

businesses of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and are adequate
to conduct such businesses as currently conducted.

  



  

(f) The Company has made available to Parent copies of all of the leases and
amendments with respect to the Leased Real Property, if any, which copies are
true and complete in all material respects. Each Material Lease is a valid
and subsisting lease enforceable against the parties thereto in
accordance with its terms. As of the date hereof, to the Companys
Knowledge, no default of any landlord under any of such Material Lease after
applicable grace periods, if any, exists. The Company has not received any
written notices alleging a default by the Company or its Subsidiaries under
the Material Leases and, to the Companys Knowledge, there are (i) no
defaults by the Company or its Subsidiaries under any of such Material Leases
that would entitle the landlord thereunder to terminate same and (ii) no
events which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute such a
default.

  



  

27      
   



  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any real property.

  



  

(h) No representation or warranty is made in this Section 3.14 with respect

Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list as of the date

issued or subject to an application for registration and specifying as to
each such Owned Intellectual Property Right, as applicable, (i) the nature of
such Intellectual Property Right, (ii) the owner of such Intellectual
Property Right, (iii) the jurisdictions by or in which such Intellectual
Property Right has been issued, registered or in which an application for
such issuance or registration has been filed, and (iv) the registration or
application numbers thereof.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Owned
Intellectual Property Rights are not limited to those items set forth on this
Section 3.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule but rather include all
items covered by the definition of Owned Intellectual Property Rights,
whether or not identified on a Schedule, including for illustration purposes
only and not as a limitation, trade secrets and unregistered copyrighted
material.

  



  

(b) Section 3.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth as of the
date hereof each and every written IP License (other than shrink wrap or

and sets forth as of the date hereof (i) the title of the IP License, (ii)
the date thereof and (iii) the parties thereto.

  



  

(c) The Owned Intellectual Property Rights and the Intellectual Property
Rights used under the IP Licenses together constitute all the material
Intellectual Property Rights necessary to, or used or held for use in, the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted.  The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not adversely affect any material Owned Intellectual Property
Rights or require any consent or other action by any Person under, constitute
a default or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default under, or cause or permit the termination,
cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled under any IP License, except in each case as would not reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries in any material
respect, which, for the purpose of this sentence shall mean that the business
of the Company could not be conducted as currently conducted or in a
substantially similar manner or otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, own or
have sufficient rights to use the work product developed for them under their
currently existing software development agreements in their business as
currently conducted.

  



  

28      
   



  

(d) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries is infringing, misappropriating
or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property Right of any third Person,
and during the seven years prior to the date hereof, none of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any
Intellectual Property Right of any third Person in any manner, in either case
that has or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company and
its Subsidiaries in any material respect, which, for the purpose of this
sentence shall mean that the business of the Company could not be conducted
as currently conducted or in a substantially similar manner or otherwise has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. There is no claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending
against, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against, the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
present officer, director or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company (i) based upon, or challenging or seeking to deny or restrict, the
rights of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (A) in any of the
Owned Intellectual Property Rights or (B) under any IP License, (ii) alleging
that the use of the Owned Intellectual Property Rights or the Intellectual
Property Rights under any IP License or any services provided, processes used
or products manufactured, used, imported or sold by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company do or may conflict with, misappropriate, infringe
or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Right of any Third Party or
(iii) alleging that the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual
Property Right of any Third Party except in each case as has not had or would
not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company and its
Subsidiaries in any material respect, which, for the purpose of this sentence
shall mean that the business of the Company could not be conducted as
currently conducted or in a substantially similar manner or otherwise have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

(e) The Companys and its Subsidiaries right, title and interest in and to
all material Owned Intellectual Property Rights are free and clear of any
Lien other than Permitted Liens.

  



  

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has infringed, misappropriated
or otherwise violated any material Owned Intellectual Property Right other
than as has not and would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Company and its Subsidiaries in any material respect, which, for the purpose
of this sentence shall mean that the business of the Company could not be
conducted as currently conducted or in a substantially similar manner, or
otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

 _Section 3.16_. _Insurance Coverage_. The Company has furnished to Parent a
list of, and made available to Parent true and complete copies of, all
insurance policies and fidelity bonds relating to the assets, business,
operations, employees, officers or directors of the Company and its
domestic Subsidiaries. There is no material claim by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company pending under

  



  

29      
   



  

any insurance policy (each, an " **Insurance** **Policy** ") or fidelity
bond (each, a " **Bond** ") relating to the assets, business, operations,
employees, officers or directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries as to
which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of
such Insurance Policy or Bond or in respect of which such underwriters have
reserved their rights. All premiums payable under all Insurance Policies and
Bonds have been timely paid and the Company and its Subsidiaries have
otherwise complied in all material respects with the terms and conditions of
all Insurance Policies and Bonds.  The Insurance Policies and Bonds (or other
policies and bonds providing substantially similar insurance coverage) have
been in effect since July 1, 2000 and remain in full force and effect.  The
Insurance Policies and Bonds are of the type and in amounts customarily
carried by Persons conducting businesses similar to those of the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company.  As of the date hereof, the Company does not
know of any threatened termination of, premium increase with respect to, or
material alteration of coverage under, any Insurance Policy or Bond.

  



  

 _Section 3.17_. _Licenses and Permits_. Section 3.17 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule correctly describes each license, franchise, permit,
certificate, approval or other similar authorization affecting, or relating
in any way to, the assets or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(other than with respect to real property) (the " **Permits** "), together
with the name of the government agency or entity issuing such Permit, except
for such Permits the failure of which to hold would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set
forth in Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) such Permits
set forth in Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule are valid and in
full force and effect, (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company is in default under, and no condition exists that with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a default under, such Permits set
forth in Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (iii) none of
such Permits set forth in Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
will be terminated or impaired or become terminable, in whole or in part, as
a result of the transactions contemplated hereby.

compliance with all currently applicable laws respecting employment
and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and
hours, and are not engaged in any unfair labor practice, failure to comply

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no unfair labor
practice complaint pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened

 _Section 3.22_. _Employee Benefit Plans._ (a) Section 3.22(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list identifying
each "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA that is
subject to any provision of ERISA, each material employment, severance or
similar contract, plan, arrangement or policy and each other material plan
or arrangement (written or oral) providing for compensation,
bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock related rights or other
forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation benefits, insurance
(including any self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits,
employee assistance program, disability or sick leave benefits, workers
compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and
post-employment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension,
health, medical or life insurance benefits) which is maintained, administered
or contributed to by the Company or any Affiliate and covers any employee or
former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability. Copies of
such plans (and, if applicable, related trust or funding agreements
or insurance policies) and all amendments thereto and all current summary
plan descriptions, summaries of material modifications and material
communications to employees have been made available to Parent together with
the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B
thereto) and tax return (Form 990) prepared in connection with any such plan
or trust. Such plans are referred to collectively herein as the " **Employee
Plans**."

  



  

(b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any predecessor thereof
sponsors, maintains or contributes to, or has in the past sponsored,
maintained or contributed to, any Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

  



  

(c) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter, or has pending or
has time remaining in which to file an application for such determination,
from the Internal Revenue Service, and to the Knowledge of the Company there
is no reason why any such determination letter should be revoked or not be
reissued nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has revocation been

  



  

33      
   



  

threatened. Each corresponding trust intended to be exempt from federal
income tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code has been determined to be
so exempt by the IRS.  The Company has made available to Parent copies of the
most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letters with respect to
each such Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan has been maintained in material
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which
are applicable to such Employee Plan, and all contributions required to be
made under each Employee Plan have been made or accrued. No material events
have occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that would reasonably be
expected to result in payment or assessment by or against the Company of any
material excise taxes under Section 4975, 4979, 4980B or 5000 of the Code.

  



  

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or set forth in Section
3.22(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not by itself entitle any
employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material
obligation pursuant to, any Employee Plan. The consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone
or upon the occurrence of additional acts or events) result in any payment
under any Employee Plan that would constitute an "excess parachute payment"
for purposes of Section 280G or 4999 of the Code.

  



  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in
respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries
except as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

  



  

(f) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to,
or change in employee participation or coverage under, an Employee Plan which
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan above
the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recently
ended fiscal year.

  



  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject
to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any
collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding with a
labor union or organization.

  



  

(h) Excluding routine claims for benefits, there is no action, suit, audit,
proceeding or, to the Knowledge of the Company, investigation pending against
or involving or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or

  



  

34      
   



  

involving any Employee Plan before any court or arbitrator or any state,
federal or local governmental body, agency or official.

  



  

(i) Each International Plan has been maintained in substantial compliance
with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all applicable
statutes, orders, rules and regulations (including any special provisions
relating to qualified plans where such Plan was intended so to qualify) and
has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities.
 According to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently
used for the purpose of funding each International Plan (or, if the same has
no such assumptions and valuations or is unfunded, according to actuarial
assumptions and valuations in use by the PBGC on the date hereof), as of the
most recent valuation date applicable to such International Plan, the total
amount or fair value of the funds available under such Plan to pay benefits
accrued thereunder or segregated in respect of such accrued benefits,
together with any reserve or accrual with respect thereto, exceeded the
accrued benefit obligations under such Plan. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates will get the full benefit of any
such funds, accruals or reserves.

  



  

 _Section 3.23_ _.  Environmental Matters. _(a) Prior to the date hereof
and except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company:

summons or order has been received, no complaint has been filed, no penalty
has been assessed, and no investigation, action, claim, suit, proceeding or
review (or any basis therefor) is pending or, to the Knowledge of the

all Environmental Laws and all Environmental Permits; and

  



  

(iii) there are no liabilities of or relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute,
determined, determinable or otherwise arising under or relating to any
Environmental Law and there are no facts, conditions, situations or set of
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in or be the basis
for any such liability.

  



  

(b) There has been no material environmental investigation, study, audit,
test, review or other analysis conducted since January 1, 2000, of which the
Company has Knowledge in relation to the current or prior business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any property or facility now or
previously owned or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has
not been made available to Parent at least five Business Days prior to the
date hereof.

  



  

35      
   



  

(c) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not trigger
any requirements under Sections 22a-134 through 22a-134e of the Connecticut
General Statutes, as amended, and any rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder.

  



  

(d) For purposes of this Section 3.23, the terms " **Company** " and "
**Subsidiaries** " shall include any entity that is, in whole or in part, a
predecessor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, though all
representations and warranties with respect to predecessors shall be made

or any Subsidiary of the Company, (i) is involved in any material business
arrangement or other relationship with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

of incorporation and bylaws or indemnification agreements with such
Indemnified Persons, in each case in effect on the date hereof; _provided_
that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from
time to time under applicable law.

  



  

46

provide officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time covering each such
Indemnified Person currently covered by the Companys officers and
directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and

respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount; _provided further_ that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute for such Company policies new policies with at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous and
provided that said substitution does not result in any gaps or lapses in
coverage.

  



  

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or

addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other applicable laws or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

benefits received by such individuals in the aggregate immediately prior to
the date hereof under applicable Employee Plans (other than any Employee Plan
providing for stock based compensation or benefits). The provisions of
this Section 7.04 shall not create in any current or former employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries any rights to employment or continued employment

to any specific terms or conditions of

  



  

47

eliminate any investment choice in the Companys 401(k) plan, including
without limitation the employer stock fund, and may change vendors and other
service providers associated with such plan from time to time.

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.04, nothing herein shall
prevent Parent from amending or terminating any Employee Plan in accordance
with its terms.

  



  

(c) If, following the Effective Time, Parent determines to permit the
employees of the Company to participate in the employee benefit plans and
arrangements of Parent (" **Parent Plans** "), Parent shall provide any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who was an employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and has continued
to be so until the effective time of such proposed participation (each, an "
**Affected Employee** ") full credit for such Affected Employees service
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or predecessors for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under the Parent Plans, to the same extent recognized
under similar plans or arrangements of the Company or such Subsidiary in
which any such Affected Employee participated prior to and, to the extent
applicable, following, the Effective Time, except: (i) with respect to any
health plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries, Parent will,
in accordance with the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (" **HIPAA** "), waive any limitation on
medical coverage due to pre-existing conditions for an employee or dependant
who is covered under the Companys health plan immediately prior to the date
on which such employee or dependent would be covered under a health plan
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) Parent shall not be
obligated to provide credit for years of service for benefit accrual purposes
under any defined benefit pension plan maintained by Parent or its
Subsidiaries prior to the date on which the employee actually becomes a
participant in such plan, and (iii) with respect to any health plan of Parent
or one of its Subsidiaries which provides post-retirement coverage, Parent
will provide credit only for periods of an employees employment with Parent
or its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining eligibility.
