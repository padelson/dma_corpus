and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. At
the Effective Time, all certificates representing common stock of Merger Sub
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Capital Stock held by the
Company as treasury stock (other than shares in a Company Plan) or owned by
Parent or Merger Sub (other than shares held in trust accounts, managed
accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties) immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.

  

Section 3.2 _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, all
of the outstanding Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist. Certificates
representing such shares of Company Common Stock, if any, prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock were converted in
the Merger pursuant to Section 3.1. Holders of Company Common Stock as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will, as of the Effective Time, cease
to be, and will have no rights as, stockholders of the Company, other than
rights to receive the Merger Consideration provided under this Article III.

Section 3.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

  

(a) Each then-outstanding award of options to purchase Company Common Stock
granted under the Company Stock Plan or as an inducement grant (a " _Company
Stock Option_ ") shall, in accordance with the Company Stock Plan or any
applicable award agreement, be converted at the Effective Time into an option
to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company Stock Option (other than changes necessary to reflect the Merger), the
number of shares of Parent Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share
(" _Parent Common Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole share),
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock
Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio.

  

(b) Each then-outstanding award of restricted stock units or deferred stock
units (other than any Company PSU Award) with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan or as an inducement grant (a
" _Company RSU Award_ ") that was granted on or after January 23, 2017 and is
not held by a non-employee director, former employee or employee whose
employment is being terminated involuntarily without "cause" (as defined in
the applicable Company Stock Plan) immediately following the Effective Time
shall, in accordance with the Company Stock Plan or any applicable award
agreement thereunder, be converted at the Effective Time into a restricted
stock unit award, subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company RSU Award (other than changes necessary to reflect the
Merger), with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined
by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share). With respect to all other Company
RSU Awards, each such Company RSU Award shall fully vest and be converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such Merger Consideration and
any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents shall be paid, less withholding
for applicable Taxes, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time and in any event not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following
the Effective Time (or any later date required by Section 409A of the Code).

  

(c) Each then-outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan or as an
inducement grant with performance-based vesting or delivery requirements (a "
_Company PSU Award_ " and together with the Company Stock Options and Company
RSU Awards, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") that was granted on or after
January 23, 2017 and is not held by a non-employee director, former employee
or employee whose employment is being terminated involuntarily without "cause"
(as defined in the applicable Company Stock Plan) immediately following the
Effective Time shall, in accordance with the Company Stock Plan or any
applicable award agreement thereunder, be converted at the Effective Time into
a restricted stock unit award, subject to the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such Company PSU Award (other than changes necessary to
reflect the Merger and the performance-based

  

 

16  

  

vesting schedule, which shall be converted into a service-based vesting
schedule in accordance with the applicable award agreement), with respect to a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the
applicable PSU Share Number by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest
whole share). With respect to all other Company PSU Awards, each such Company
PSU Award shall fully vest and be converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company PSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time (with the total number of shares subject to each Company PSU
Award deemed to be equal to the PSU Share Number). Such Merger Consideration
and any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents shall be paid, less
withholding for applicable Taxes, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day
following the Effective Time (or any later date required by Section 409A of
the Code).

  

(d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any
event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Company Stock Plan) shall adopt resolutions or
take such other actions as may be required to effect the foregoing provisions
of this Section 3.3.

  

(e) Any shares of Company Common Stock that remain available for issuance
pursuant to the Company Stock Plan as of the Effective Time (the " _Residual
Shares_ ") shall, in accordance with the Company Stock Plan, be converted at
the Effective Time into the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, equal to
the product of the number of such Residual Shares and the Exchange Ratio (such
shares of Parent Common Stock, the " _Assumed Shares_ "). At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need of any further corporate
action, Parent shall assume the Company Stock Plan, with the result that
Parent may issue the Assumed Shares after the Effective Time pursuant to the
exercise of options or other equity awards granted under the Company Stock
Plans or any other plan of Parent or any its Affiliates.

  

(f) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to issue a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock with respect to the settlement of
Company Equity Awards contemplated by this Section 3.3. Effective as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such awards and shall maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such awards remain outstanding.

  

Section 3.4 _Surrender and Payment_.

  

(a) At or promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent (subject to the
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, of the Company) (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of (i) certificates that immediately
prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the
" _Uncertificated Shares_ "), for exchange in accordance with this Article
III, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amounts payable under Section
3.1(a). As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Effective
Time, Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
at

  

 

17  

  

the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent) for use in such exchange. Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation or transfer of
Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by any such
Certificate and such Certificate so surrendered and the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by any such Uncertificated Shares shall
forthwith be cancelled.

  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated
Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

  

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on
the stock transfer books of Company Capital Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with, the procedures set forth
in this Article III.

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be paid, at
the request of Parent, to Parent or as otherwise directed by Parent, and any
such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.4 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, none of the Acquirer Parties, the Company, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any holder or former holder of shares
of Company Common Stock for any amount

  

 

18  

  

properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

  

Section 3.5 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock shall occur, in each case as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, or any other similar change in capitalization, but
excluding for the avoidance of doubt any change that results from (a) any
exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof, or permitted to become
outstanding hereafter, to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted
under the Company Stock Plan or (b) any vesting of Company Equity Awards
outstanding as of the date hereof, or permitted to become outstanding
hereafter, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

  

Section 3.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

Section 3.7 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if required by DGCL (but only to the extent
required thereby), shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(c)) and that are
held by holders of such shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have
complied with, Section 262 of DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be
convertible into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of
such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair value
of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section
262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws
or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under DGCL. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses such right, such Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the
Merger Consideration for such shares. At the Effective Time, any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the rights provided in Section 262 of DGCL and as provided in the previous
sentence. The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) of any demands received by the Company for
appraisals, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to DGCL and received by the Company in respect of
Dissenting Shares, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any demands for

  

 

19  

  

appraisal or settle, compromise, offer to settle or compromise, or otherwise
negotiate any such demands.

  

Section 3.8 _Withholding_. Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, the Paying Agent and any of their
respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under all
applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
recipient of the payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

  

ARTICLE IV 
  
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

Except as disclosed (i) in the Company Disclosure Letter (with specific
reference to the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the
information stated in such Company Disclosure Letter relates; _provided_ ,
that any item on the Company Disclosure Letter in any one or more sections of
the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed with respect to other
sections of this Agreement and all other sections or subsections of the
Company Disclosure Letter solely to the extent that the relevance of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face notwithstanding the absence of a
specific cross‑reference) or (ii) in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to
the date hereof solely to the extent that the relevance of such disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face (but excluding, in each case, any disclosures
set forth in any risk factor section, in any section relating to
forward‑looking statements and any other disclosures included in the Company
SEC Documents solely to the extent that they are generic, cautionary,
predictive or forward‑looking in nature, whether or not appearing in such
sections), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

  

Section 4.1 _Corporate Existence and Power_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized or formed and validly existing and, except
as would not reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective operations, taken as a whole, is in
good standing (in jurisdictions where applicable) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, (b) has all requisite power
(corporate, company or limited partnership, as the case may be) and authority
to own and operate its property, assets or rights, to lease the property,
assets or rights it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it
is currently engaged, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
material impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
operations, taken as a whole, and (c) is duly qualified to do business and in
good standing (in jurisdictions where applicable) under the Laws of each
jurisdiction in which its ownership, lease or operation of property, assets or
rights or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. No jurisdiction, other than those in which
such Person is duly qualified, has claimed in writing that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is required to qualify as a foreign corporation or other
entity therein, except with respect to jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified

  

 

20  

  

would not reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective operations, taken as a whole.

  

Section 4.2 _Authorization; No Contravention_. The Company has all requisite
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement has been duly authorized and approved by the Company, and no
corporate, company, limited partnership, stockholder or other action on the
part of the Company is necessary to approve or consummate the Merger other
than the receipt of the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Company Common Stock, voting
together as a single class (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). Assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in
Article V of this Agreement, the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement, assuming that the consents, approvals and filings
referred to in Section 4.3 and the Company Stockholder Approval are duly
obtained and/or made, do not (i) violate, conflict with or result in any
breach, default or contravention of (or with due notice or lapse of time or
both would result in any breach, default or contravention of), require any
consent, notice, filing or other action by any Person under, give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the
loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien under, any
Contractual Obligation of the Company or its Subsidiaries, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) violate, conflict
with or result in any breach, default or contravention of (or with due notice
or lapse of time or both would result in any breach, default or contravention
of) any organizational document, instrument or certificate of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) violate, conflict with or result in any breach,
default or contravention of (or with due notice or lapse of time or both would
result in any breach, default or contravention of) any material Applicable Law
applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (iv) except for expiration
or early termination, as the case may be, of all applicable waiting periods
under the HSR Act, violate any orders, injunctions, judgments, decrees,
determinations or regulatory restrictions of any Governmental Authority (or
determinations of an arbitrator) against, or binding upon, the Company or its
Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Orders_ ").

  

Section 4.3 _Governmental Approvals_. Except for (a) such filings and
notifications as may be required by the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws set
forth in _Schedule 4.3_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (b) for any required
consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or

the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, (f) such filings of reports under the Exchange Act and as
contemplated by the rules of the NYSE, and (g) any approval, consent,
authorization or filing that if not obtained would not be reasonably expected
to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no
approval,

  

 

21  

  

consent, compliance, exemption, authorization or other action by, or notice
to, or filing with, any applicable Governmental Authority with jurisdiction or
supervision over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no lapse of a
waiting period under any Applicable Law, is necessary or required in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance by, or enforcement
against, the Company of this Agreement (including effectiveness of the
Merger).

  

Section 4.4 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company, and this Agreement constitutes, when duly executed
and delivered by Company, shall constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity relating to enforceability (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity).

  

Section 4.5 _Litigation_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.5_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, there are no Claims pending, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, at Law, in equity, in arbitration or by or before any
Governmental Authority against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, that would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No
material outstanding Order has been issued by any court or other Governmental
Authority against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which any of
their respective assets or properties is subject or bound. _Schedule 4.5_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date hereof, a true,
correct and complete list of each Claim or Order that (i) resulted in any
criminal sanctions to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) within the
last three years resulted in an Order requiring payments in excess of
$250,000, in each case by or against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or, in their capacity as such, any of their respective officers or directors,
or (iii) within the last three years, imposed any injunctive relief with
respect to, or that has required the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
alter, its business practices.

  

Section 4.6 _Compliance with Laws_.

  

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is and has been since December 31,

reasonably expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold all material authorizations,

individual, under Applicable Law, to have and maintain a Permit in respect to
such individual's activities for the Company or its Subsidiaries (each such
individual, an " _Associated Person_ ") (i) has such Permit, (ii) such Permit
is in full force and effect and (iii) such Associated Person is not subject to
a "statutory disqualification" (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act)
or any other disqualification that would be a basis for censure, limitations
on the activities, functions or operations of the individual or suspension or
revocation of any such Permit, by any Governmental Authority or SRO.

  

(d) Since December 31, 2015, (i) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received (and there is no Knowledge of the Company of) any
written notice from any Governmental Authority that (x) alleges any

Associated Persons is under investigation or the subject of an inquiry by any
such Governmental Authority for such alleged noncompliance) with any
Applicable Law, (y) asserts any deficiency in required legal capital or (z)
would be reasonably likely to result in a material fine, assessment or cease

restriction of any Permit, in each of cases (x), (y) and (z), that is material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any agreement or

Associated Persons).

since December 31, 2015.

  

(i) No Governmental Authority or SRO has, prior to the date hereof, expressly

issued by the Internal Revenue Service and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
no circumstances exist which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
such qualification or exemption.

  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability
or obligation under any Company Plan to provide welfare benefits after
termination of employment to any employee or dependent other than as required
by Section 4980B of the Code or other Applicable Law.

  

(h) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains, sponsors,
participates in, contributes to or is obligated to contribute to, or has
within the last six (6) years maintained, sponsored, participated in,
contributed to was obligated to contribute to, or otherwise has incurred any
obligation or liability (including any contingent liability) under, any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA) or any
other employee pension benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code. No Company Plan is a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of
Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or the equivalent thereof under applicable
non-U.S. Laws). Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not resulted or would not reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no
event has occurred and no condition exists that would, either directly or by
reason of the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' affiliation with any of
their ERISA Affiliates, subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other

  

 

34  

  

liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other Applicable Law, in each case, as
related to the Company Plans.

  

(i) Each Company Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code is in compliance, in
all material respects, in form and operation with Section 409A of the Code and
the applicable guidance and regulations thereunder.

  

(j) Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.13(j)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the Merger, will cause or result in (either alone or in
combination with another event): (i) any of the following with respect to any
current or former officer, employee, manager, director, or consultant of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries: (A) any material payment, compensation, or
benefit (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due, or material
increase in the amount of any payment, compensation, or benefit becoming due,
or (B) the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any material
payment, compensation, or benefit, or (ii) the payment or deemed payment of
any amount (whether in cash, property, the vesting of property, or otherwise)
that would reasonably be expected, individually or in combination with any
other such payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment," as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code, or (iii) any material funding obligation under
any Company Plan or an imposition of any material restrictions or limitations
on the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' right to administer, amend, or
terminate any Company Plan. No person is entitled to receive any Tax gross-up
payment from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the
imposition of any excise taxes required by Section 4999 of the Code.

  

(k) Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
resulted or would not reasonably be expected to result in material liability
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, each Company Plan
maintained exclusively for the benefit of employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries residing outside of the United States (each, a " _Non-U.S.
Company Plan_ ") has been maintained in compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all Applicable Law (including any special
provisions relating to qualified plans where such Non-U.S. Company Plan was
intended to so qualify) and all such plans that are intended to be funded
and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate,
based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions. There is no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation relating to any Non-U.S.
Company Plan. Except as required by Applicable Law, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries offers employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries participation in any Non-U.S. Company Plans that provide defined
benefit pension benefits.

  

Section 4.14 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth on _Schedule
4.14_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect Liabilities, other than (a)
Liabilities fully and adequately reflected in or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of June 30,
2018 included in Company SEC Documents filed before the date of this
Agreement, (b) Liabilities incurred since December 31, 2017 in the ordinary
course of business, (c) Liabilities that are permitted by this Agreement in
accordance with the terms hereof, (d) Liabilities that have been discharged or
paid off, (e) Liabilities that would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, and (f) Liabilities

Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use
all Intellectual Property that is used in the conduct of the Company Business
(collectively, the " _Company Intellectual Property_ "), in each case free and
clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Upon the Closing, except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken together, the Surviving Corporation will own or
continue to have the right to use, as applicable, all Company Intellectual
Property on substantially identical terms and conditions as the Company and
its Subsidiaries enjoyed immediately prior to the Closing.

  

(b) _Schedule 4.15(b) _of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all of the

owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as would not be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) none of the
Company Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is subject to any outstanding Order and there are no Claims pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any such Company Intellectual Property, and (ii)
all of the registrations and applications set forth on _Schedule 4.15(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter are valid and in full force and effect. The
Company has taken all actions within its power or authority reasonably
necessary to ensure protection of the Intellectual Property listed on
_Schedule 4.15(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter under Applicable Law
(including making and maintaining in full force and effect all necessary
filings, registrations and issuances) and to protect the secrecy,
confidentiality and value of its Trade Secrets, except for actions which, if
not taken, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

(c) Except as would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (i) neither the conduct of the Company Business nor the use of
any Company Intellectual Property nor any products or services currently or
previously sold, provided or licensed by the Company or any of its

alleging any such infringement or violation or challenging the rights of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in or with respect to any Company
Intellectual Property.

  

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of the Company, no Person is infringing upon
or otherwise violating any Company Intellectual Property or any rights of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries therein.

  

 

36  

  

(e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material effect on
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken together, each present or past
employee, consultant and any other Person who developed any Company
Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries (including any Owned Software) has executed a valid and
enforceable Contract with the Company or a Subsidiary that (i) conveys to the
Company or such Subsidiary any _and_ all right, title and interest in and to
all Intellectual Property developed by such Person in connection with such
Person's employment or engagement by the Company or such Subsidiary, (ii)
requires such Person, during and after the term of employment or engagement,

patent applications filed in connection with such Intellectual Property, (iii)
establishes, in all material respects, a representation and covenant by such
Person that no process, technique, innovation or other work product provided
to the Company or such Subsidiary is or will be derived from or otherwise
constitute the proprietary information of a prior employer or contractor, in
contravention of any prior confidentiality agreement, and (iv) obligates such
Person to keep any confidential Information, including Trade Secrets, of the
Company and its Subsidiaries confidential both during and after the term of
employment or engagement.

Person has gained unauthorized access to or made any unauthorized use of the
IT Assets or any Information contained therein, including any Personal

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a material effect on
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken together, (i) no Owned Software used
in the Company Business uses any "open source" code, shareware or other
Software that is made generally available to the public without requiring
payment of fees in such a way as would require disclosure or licensing of, or
waiver of any rights with respect to, any Owned Software or any other
Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
(ii) none of the Company Software is covered by or subject to the requirements
of any version of the GNU General Public License (the " _GPL_ ") or the GNU
Affero General Public License (the " _Affero GPL_ ") and, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Company has replaced any jPOS code licensed under the GPL or the
Affero GPL used in the Company Software with code that is not subject to the
GPL or Affero GPL, and the distribution, sale or licensing of the Company
Software, including such replacement code, does not infringe the copyright of
any other Person, including jPOS.org. With respect to all material Owned
Software, the Company or a Subsidiary is in actual possession and control of
the applicable source code, object code, code writes, notes, documentation,
and know-how to the extent required for use, distribution, development,
enhancement, maintenance and support of such Owned Software. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has disclosed or otherwise granted, in
the ordinary course of business, a right to use source code for Owned Software
to a third party outside of the scope of a written

  

 

37

Policy and all Applicable Laws regarding the collection, use and protection of
any personally identifiable or non‑public financial Information (collectively,
" _Personal Information_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries have customary
security measures in place to protect Personal Information stored in their
computer systems from unlawful use by any third party or any other use by a
third party that would violate the Company Privacy Policy (the " _Security
Programs_ "). Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries are fully compliant
with all applicable requirements of EU General Data Protection Regulation
EU/2016/679 and any Laws implementing or supplementing such regulation
(collectively, " _GDPR_ "), including that: (i) all processor agreements
affecting Personal Information will be in compliance with Article 28 of the

Information was collected or obtained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and, upon the Closing, the Surviving Corporation will own and
continue to have the right to use all such Personal Information on identical
terms and conditions as the Company and its Subsidiaries enjoyed immediately

there is no civil, criminal or administrative Claim, notice or demand letter
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Environmental Laws and (iii) to the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no past or present events, conditions,
circumstances, activities, practices, incidents, agreements, actions or plans
which would reasonably be expected to prevent compliance in all material
respects with, or which have given rise to or shall give rise to liability
under, the Environmental Laws.

those insurance policies or binders of insurance identified on _Schedule 4.18_
of the Company Disclosure Letter. Such policies and binders are valid and
enforceable in accordance with their terms and are in full force and effect
and no written notice of cancellation, suspension, denial, limitation of
coverage or termination has been received or threatened with respect to any
such policy, in each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to be

Section 4.19 _Controls_. The Company has established and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures and a system of internal controls over financial
reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively,
of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act, designed (i) to ensure that material information required to be

Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis
to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company's filings
with the SEC and other public disclosure documents, and (ii) to provide

weaknesses" (as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in
the design or operation of the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting which would, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect or
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data, in each case which has not been
subsequently remediated or (B) any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and corporate

guaranties thereof (each, a " _Company Lease_ " and the real property covered
by each such Company Lease, a " _Company Leased Facility_ "). The Company has
made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all Company
Leases. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Company Lease is
valid, binding and enforceable against the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary in accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles) and is in full
force and effect with respect to the Company or its applicable Subsidiary and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, with respect to the other parties thereto;

any written notice of default under any Company Lease or of any intention of
any party to terminate or not renew the Company Lease; and (iv) the Company
and its Subsidiaries have a valid leasehold interest in all of the Company
Leased Facilities free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. The
Company Leased Facilities collectively constitute all of the material real

Subsidiaries as currently conducted. The Company or its applicable Subsidiary
has not subleased, licensed or given any other Person the right to use or
occupy any of the Company Leased Facilities.

taken all necessary action so that any takeover, anti−takeover, moratorium,
"fair price", "control share" or other similar Law enacted under any Law
applicable to the Company does not, and will not, apply to the Merger, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. There is no stockholder
rights plan, "poison pill" antitakeover plan or similar device in effect to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, party to or otherwise
bound.

respect to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding any
Acquirer Party or any of their Affiliates, and neither the Company nor any of

Section 5.8 _Financing; Solvency_

  

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, accurate and complete copies of
executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ ") pursuant to which the lenders named therein (the "
_Lenders_ "), subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, have
committed to lend to VFH Parent LLC and Impala Borrower LLC, each a direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (each, a " _Borrower_ "), the
amounts set forth therein, and such amounts are sufficient for Parent to fund
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the refinancing of
the Company Credit Agreement and the refinancing of the Fourth Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 30, 2017 among VFH Parent LLC, as
borrower, Virtu Financial LLC, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, as amended (such committed debt
financing, the " _Debt Financing_ ", and the amount of financing required for
the foregoing purposes, the " _Required Amounts_ "). Parent has delivered to
the Company a true, complete and correct copy of all fee letters (the " _Fee
Letters_ ") related to the Debt Commitment Letter, subject to redaction solely
of fee, flex and other economic provisions that are customarily redacted in
connection with transactions of this type and that could not in any event
affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or amount of the Debt
Financing.

  

(b) As of the date hereof, (i) the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated, or amended or modified or
waived in any respect, and (ii) the Debt Commitment Letter, in the form so
delivered, is a legal, valid and

  

 

44  

  

binding obligation of Parent and/or Merger Sub (as applicable) and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors' rights and subject, as to enforceability, to
general equity principles. Except for the Fee Letters, there are no other
agreements, side letters, or arrangements of any kind relating to the Debt
Commitment Letter that would affect the amount, availability, enforceability
or conditionality of the Debt Financing. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or its Subsidiaries under
any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, would (i) make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect, (ii)
result in any of the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter not being
satisfied or (iii) otherwise result in the Debt Financing not being available
on the date of the Closing. As of the date hereof, no Debt Financing Source
has notified Parent, Merger Sub or any Borrower of its intention to terminate
any of the Debt Commitment Letter or not to provide the Debt Financing.
Assuming satisfaction of the conditions in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3, as of
the date hereof, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any Borrower has any reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or
condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter or that the full amounts committed pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letter will not be available as of the Closing. There are no conditions
precedent (including any "flex" provisions) to the funding of the full amount
of the Debt Financing and there are no contingencies that would permit the
Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Financing other than as set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent, Merger Sub and the Borrowers have fully
paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees required
by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this
Agreement. As of the date hereof, Debt Commitment Letter has not been
modified, amended or altered and none of the commitments thereunder has been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated. As of the date hereof, no
amendment or modification to the Debt Commitment Letter is contemplated other
than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

  

(c) Assuming the funding of the Debt Financing in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent will have available at
Closing sufficient cash in immediately available funds to pay the Required
Amounts. The Parent Common Stock to be issued or become issuable pursuant to
Section 3.3 has been duly authorized and reserved for issuance and, when
issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and free and clear of all Encumbrances.

  

(d) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) by Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective affiliates or any other financing or other
transactions be a condition to any of Parent's or Merger Sub's obligations
under this Agreement.

  

(e) Assuming that the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived, then immediately after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
consummation of the Debt Financing), (i) the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will

  

  

 

45  

  

be able to pay their Indebtedness and Liabilities, as such Indebtedness and
Liabilities become absolute and matured, (ii) the then present fair saleable
value of the assets of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, will exceed or equal the amount that will be required to
pay their probable Liabilities (including the probable amount of all
contingent Liabilities) and Indebtedness as such Liabilities and Indebtedness
become absolute or matured, (iii) the assets of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, at a fair valuation, will exceed
their probable Liabilities (including the probable amount of all contingent
Liabilities) and Indebtedness and (iv) the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will not have unreasonably small
capital to carry on their businesses as presently conducted or as proposed to
be conducted.

agree that, except for the representations or warranties expressly set forth
in _Article IV_ , neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates nor any other
person on behalf of the Company has made any representation or warranty,
expressed or implied, with respect to the Company, its respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,

plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or with respect to
the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company, and
neither the Acquirer Parties nor any of their Affiliates nor any other person
on behalf of the Acquirer Parties has relied on any representation or warranty
except for those expressly set forth in Article IV.

with an opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement or response
(including the proposed final version of the Proxy Statement or response),

Company shall promptly notify Parent of such event, and the Company and the

its Subsidiaries to, make available to the Acquirer Parties (i) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of the federal
securities Laws or federal or state banking, mortgage lending, real estate or
consumer finance or protection Laws (other than reports or documents which the
Company is not permitted to disclose under Applicable Law) and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, violate any
contract or agreement or contravene any Law; and in any such event, the
parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements.

  

 

53  

  

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
entered into between the Company and Parent, dated as of April 11, 2018 and
amended as of September 28, 2018 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  

(c) No investigation by any of the Parties or their respective representatives
shall constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the others set forth herein.

  

Section 7.4 _No Solicitation by the Company; the Company Board
Recommendation_.

  

(a) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 7.4, the Company shall
not, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates or any of
its or their respective officers, directors or employees, agents, affiliates
and representatives (including any investment bankers, attorneys or
accountants retained by it or any of its Affiliates) (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate,
or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate (including by way of providing
information) any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to result in a Company Takeover
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or
cooperate in any way with any Person (whether or not a Person making a Company
Takeover Proposal) with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
asset or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement related to any Company Takeover Proposal (an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ "), (v) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder, or (vi)
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Company Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Takeover Proposal, request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room
access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Company Takeover Proposal, which was not preceded by, or resulting
from, any breach of this Section 7.4, that the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Company Proposal,
the Company may, subject to compliance with Section 7.4(f), prior to (but not
after) the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, take any action
described in clauses (x) and (y) below, to the extent that the Company Board
concludes in good faith (and following

  

 

54  

  

consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would
be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law: (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives and any financing sources)
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, so long as any material
non-public information provided under this clause has previously been provided
to the Acquirer Parties or is provided to the Acquirer Parties substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate
in discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover Proposal and the
negotiation of such terms with the Person making such Company Takeover
Proposal (and such Person's Representatives and any financing sources);
_provided_ , that the Company shall within 24 hours provide Parent with any
information with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries provided
to such Person which was not previously provided to Parent (or its
Representatives). The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall terminate, waive, amend, modify or fail to enforce any
existing standstill or confidentiality obligations owed by any Person to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case except to the extent
necessary to permit the Company to take an action it is otherwise permitted to
take under this Section 7.4(b) in full compliance with such provision;
_provided_ , that the Company (on behalf of itself and any of its
Subsidiaries) hereby waives any such standstill obligation to the extent
necessary to permit a Person otherwise covered by such standstill to submit a
confidential unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal to the
Company Board. For purposes of clarification, the taking of any of the actions
contemplated by clause (x) or (y) of this Section 7.4(b) shall not be deemed
to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

(c) Except as set forth in Section 7.4(d), neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
Parent), or propose to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Parent),
the Company Board Recommendation, (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable,
or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Company
Takeover Proposal, (C) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), (D) enter into any agreement, letter
of intent, or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or breach
its obligations hereunder, (E) subject to Section 7.4(g), fail to recommend
against any Company Takeover Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the
Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Company Takeover
Proposal, (F) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement or re-affirm such Company Board Recommendation at the request of
Parent within ten (10) Business Days or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of
the foregoing (each being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ").

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Company Board may, prior to
(but not after) the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (x) in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal, the Company Board determines
(after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors) that such
unsolicited bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal

  

 

55  

  

constitutes a Superior Company Proposal and following consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change is reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law, or (y) other than in
connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, an event, fact, circumstance,
development or occurrence that affects the business, assets or operations of
the Company that is unknown to the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement and becomes known to the Company Board (an " _Intervening Event_ ")
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL and the Company Board
has concluded in good faith, following consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is
reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change until after the fifth (5th) Business Day (the " _Recommendation Change
Notice Period_ ") following Parent's receipt of written notice (a " _Company
Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the
Company Board intends to take such action, including the details of the
Intervening Event or, in the case of a Superior Company Proposal, the terms
and conditions of any Superior Company Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Company Board and the identity of the party making such
Superior Company Proposal, and, if applicable, shall have contemporaneously
provided a copy of all of the relevant proposed transaction agreements and any
other documents provided by, or correspondence with, the party making such
Superior Company Proposal, including the then-current form of the definitive
agreements with respect to such Superior Company Proposal (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such Superior Company
Proposal or change to the material facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event shall require a new Company Notice of Recommendation Change
and trigger a new Recommendation Change Notice Period). The Company Board may
not make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of a Superior
Company Proposal if any such Superior Company Proposal resulted from a breach
by the Company of this Section 7.4.

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining whether to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall take into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent in
response to a Company Notice of Recommendation Change or otherwise; _provided_
, that the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its financial and legal advisors to, during the Recommendation Change Notice
Period and prior to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent also seeks to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that (i) in
the event of a Company Notice of Recommendation Change in respect of a
Superior Company Proposal, this Agreement results in a transaction that is no
less favorable to the stockholders of the Company than any Company Takeover
Proposal that would be deemed to constitute a Superior Company Proposal in the
absence of such adjustments or (ii) in the event of a Company Notice of
Recommendation change in respect of an Intervening Event, the Company Board
would no longer be required to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
order not to be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law, and, in the event Parent
agrees to make such adjustments to this Agreement in either case of clause (i)
or (ii) above, as applicable, no Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall
be made.

  

 

56  

  

(f) In addition to the foregoing obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 7.4, the Company shall within 24 hours of the receipt thereof, advise
Parent orally of any Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal (including any changes
thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall (x) keep Parent informed in all material respects
and on a reasonably current basis (and in no event later than 24 hours from
the occurrence or existence of any material event, fact or circumstance) of
the status and details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of
any Company Takeover Proposal, and (y) provide to Parent as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written material exchanged between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of
any Takeover Proposal.

  

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required
disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure
to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under
Applicable Law; _provided_ , that any such statement that would be a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall be in accordance with Section 7.4(d) and
Section 7.4(e).

  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

" _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing), with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the assets or equity interests,
as applicable, of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii)
direct or indirect acquisition of more than 15% of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or voting power of the Company, (iii) sale, lease,
contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of
merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise) of any business or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of
the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) issuance, sale or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or
group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 15% or
more of the voting power of the Company, (v) any tender offer or exchange
offer as a result of which any Person or group shall acquire, directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, of 15% or more of the voting power of the Company or (vi) any
combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger).

  

" _Superior Company Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal made by a third party or group pursuant to which such third party
(or, in a

  

 

57  

  

parent-to-parent merger involving such third party, the stockholders of such
third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of
the voting power of the Company or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on terms which the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its legal and
financial advisors) (i) to be superior to the holders of Company Common Stock
from a financial point of view than (x) the Merger (including the Merger
Consideration), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and the Person making the proposal (including all financial,
regulatory, legal conditions to consummation and other aspects of such
proposal), and (y) this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent to
the terms of this Agreement), and (ii) is reasonably capable of being
consummated on the terms proposed and (iii) for which financing, if a cash
transaction (whether in whole or in part), is not a condition to closing.

  

Section 7.5 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give
each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or
other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such
party may reasonably conclude may be required by Applicable Law, court process
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. Parent and the
Company agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the Parties.

  

Section 7.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt notice
to the Company and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to
occur would cause (a) any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (b) a material
failure of Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations and warranties of any of the Parties or the conditions to the
performance by the Parties hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
failure to comply with this covenant shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this Section 7.6 or the failure of any condition set forth in
Article VIII to be satisfied, or, without limiting any remedies with respect
to any breach identified in such notice, otherwise constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying inaccuracy or material failure would independently result in a
failure of the conditions set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied.

  

Section 7.7 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  

(a) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent agrees that all rights,
existing as of the date hereof, to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided

  

 

58  

  

in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) or in any indemnification, employment or other
similar agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth in
_Schedule 7.7_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of the
date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is as of the date
of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time,
serving at the request of the Company of any of its Subsidiaries as a director
or officer of another Person (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "
_Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys' fees and disbursements (" _Losses_ "), incurred or
arising in connection with any claim, action, investigation, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring or
alleged to have existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company
Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person or any act or
omission by such Company Indemnified Party while serving in such capacity,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law. In the event of any such claim,
action, investigation, suit or proceeding, (x) each Company Indemnified Party
will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any
such claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding from the Surviving
Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Surviving
Corporation from the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
_provided_ , that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter. Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 7.7, upon learning of any threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall
promptly notify the Company and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation thereof in writing; _provided_ , that the failure promptly to so
notify in writing shall not affect the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation except to the extent, if any, that it is materially prejudiced by
such failure or delay.

  

(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.7.

  

(c) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (i) cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) provide substitute
polices for the Company and its current and former directors and officers (and
any individual who becomes an officer or director prior to the

  

 

59  

  

Effective Time) who are currently (or prior to the Effective Time become)
covered by the directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company in either case, of not less than
the amount of existing coverage and have other terms and from carriers not
less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies in respect of any one policy year more than 250% of the annual
premium payable by the Company for such insurance for the twelve-month period
ending June 30, 2019 (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
Section 7.7 it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the
years within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such
insurance, prior to the Closing Date, the Company may in consultation with
Parent, and shall if Parent so directs, purchase a "tail" directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy
for the Company and its current and former directors and officers (and any
individual who becomes an officer or director prior to the Effective Time) who
are currently (or prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
directors' and officers' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company, if and to the extent that the same may be obtained
for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed, on an annual basis, the
Maximum Amount. In the event the Company purchases such tail coverage, the
Surviving Corporation shall cease to have any obligations under the first
sentence of this Section 7.7(c).

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.7, (i) shall survive consummation of the
Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified
Parties), his or her heirs and (iii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

  

Section 7.8 _Takeover Laws_. The Parties hereto and their respective boards of
directors or other governing bodies shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, and (ii) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

  

Section 7.9 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause any disposition or acquisition by the Company's directors
and officers of shares of Company Capital Stock or conversion of any
derivative securities in respect of such shares of

  

 

60  

  

Company Capital Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, including any such actions specified in the applicable SEC
No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999.

  

Section 7.10 _Litigation_. The Company and Parent shall each give the other
Party the opportunity to participate at its own expense, to the extent
practicable and subject to Applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information and in a manner that does not result in any waiver or loss of
attorney-client privilege, in the defense or settlement of any litigation
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents, including any stockholder litigation against the
Company and/or its directors or any litigation by or against any lender under
the Company Credit Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parent's prior written consent in its sole discretion.

  

Section 7.11 _Financing_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms set forth therein (subject to any
"flex" provisions applicable thereto), including by (i) maintaining in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiating and entering into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_
") consistent with the terms and conditions contained therein (including, as
necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee letter) and
(iii) satisfying on a timely basis, or obtaining waivers of, the conditions in
the Debt Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements. Parent shall comply
with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter and Definitive
Agreements in a timely and diligent manner. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed of material developments in respect of Parent's efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing. Prior to the Closing, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Parent shall not (A) agree to, or permit, any
amendment, modification or supplement of, or waiver under, the Debt Commitment
Letter or any Definitive Agreement to the extent such amendment, modification,
supplement or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount to be funded under
the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount of the Debt Financing or similar fees unless the
aggregate amount to be funded under the Debt Financing is increased by an
equivalent amount) unless Parent has sufficient cash on hand available), (ii)
adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) any conditions to the
consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing, (iii) adversely
affects the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified, relative to the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter as in effect on the date hereof; or (iv) could otherwise reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) terminate any Debt
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver
to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or waiver of any
Debt Commitment Letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) Parent may amend
the Debt Commitment Letter solely to add investors, lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Commitment

  

  

 

61  

  

Letter as of the date hereof and, in connection therewith, amend the
allocation of economics with respect to the existing and additional investors,
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities,
if the addition of such additional parties and amendment of additional terms
do not impact the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the
Closing and (y) in the event that Parent is required pursuant to this Section
7.11 to provide any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar
privilege, Parent may withhold disclosure of such information so long as
Parent gives notice to the Company of the fact that it is withholding such
information and thereafter Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to waive the applicable privilege or protection.

  

(b) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions applicable thereto)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and such portion is necessary to
fund the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall promptly
notify the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange to obtain alternative debt financing from
alternative sources for such portion in an amount equal to the amount of the
Debt Financing. If obtained, Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true
and complete copies of a new debt financing commitment pursuant to which any
such alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent with any
portion of the Debt Financing. References in this Agreement to (i) the "Debt
Financing" shall include the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter as amended, modified or replaced, (ii) the "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall include such documents as amended, modified or replaced and
(iii) "Debt Financing Sources" shall include the providers of debt financing
under such documents as amended, modified or replaced (in the case of each of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), including replacement with alternative financing
and alternative debt financing commitments pursuant to this Section 7.11 from
and after such amendment, modification or replacement); _provided_ , that fee
letters or side letters which do not contain "flex" or other provisions which
affect the terms or amount, availability or conditions of the Debt Financing
shall not be required to be provided.

  

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to provide, such
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, including (i) participating in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due
diligence sessions and sessions with prospective Debt Financing Sources and
prospective lenders and buyers of the Debt Financing (including direct contact
between senior management and representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Debt Financing Sources and potential
lenders for the Debt Financing, on the other hand) and ratings agencies (in
each case at mutually agreed times and places), and reasonably cooperating
with the marketing efforts of Parent and its Debt Financing Sources, in each
case in connection with the Debt Financing, (ii) as promptly as reasonably
practicable, furnishing Parent and its Debt Financing Sources and their
respective Representatives with the Required Information, (iii) assisting with
the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering
documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda (including
public side versions thereof), prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing (the " _Offering Documents_ "), (iv)
providing customary authorization letters to

qualifying for subsidized

  

  

 

65

nor any rights, interests and obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any
Party, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without
the prior written consent of each of the other Parties and any attempt to make
any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void.

  

(b) Except (i) as provided in Section 7.7, (ii) for the provisions of Article
III (which, from and after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of
holders of Company Common Stock and holders of Company Equity Awards as of the
Effective Time) and (iii) for the provisions of the last sentence of Section
7.11(c) which shall be for the benefit of the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives, the Acquirer Parties and the Company hereby
agree that their respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein, except that
the Non-Recourse Parties are made third party beneficiaries of Section 10.7
and Section 10.11.

  

Section 10.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile or portable
document format (PDF) signatures shall be treated as original signatures for
all purposes hereunder.

  

Section 10.6 _Specific Performance_.

  

(a) The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
court referred to in Section 10.7 below, without proof of actual damages (and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The Parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.

Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  

(a) This Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts‑of‑law principles of such State.

  

(b) Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court and the
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware) for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise (and agrees that no such
action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it
or any of its subsidiaries except in such courts). Each of the Parties further
agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Person's
respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for
any action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to
which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately
preceding sentence. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), any objection to the laying of
venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement, whether
in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (and if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, in any Delaware State court or the Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) or that any such action,
suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF
OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO ANY DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE
THEREOF OR ANY FINANCING CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.

  

Section 10.8 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible. The Parties intend that the remedies and

  

  

 

74  

  

limitations thereon contained in this Agreement (including in Section 10.11)
be construed as integral provisions of this Agreement and that such remedies
and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a Party's
liability or obligations hereunder.

  

Section 10.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the exhibits
and schedules hereto and the Transaction Documents are intended by the Parties
as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete and
exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the Parties hereto
in respect of the subject matter contained herein and therein. There are no
restrictions, promises, representations, warranties or undertakings, other
than those set forth or referred to herein or therein. This Agreement,
together with the exhibits and schedules hereto, and the Transaction Documents
supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the Parties with
respect to such subject matter. No representation, warranty, inducement,
promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this Agreement has been
made or relied upon by any of the Parties.

  

Section 10.10 _Expenses_. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, including in Section 7.2, Section 7.11(c) or Section 9.3 hereof,
all costs and expenses incurred by any Party to this Agreement or on its
behalf in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (" _Expenses_ ") shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expense whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that
Expenses incurred in connection with printing and mailing of the Proxy
Statement and in connection with notices or other filings with any
Governmental Authorities under any Laws shall be shared equally by Parent and
the Company.

  

Section 10.11 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
all claims, obligations, liabilities or causes of action (whether in contract
or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based
upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or
relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made
in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement) may be made
only against (and are those solely of) the entities that are expressly
identified as Parties to this Agreement in the Preamble to this Agreement. No
other Person, including any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, stockholder, affiliate, agent, attorney or representative
of, or any financial advisor to, any Party to this Agreement or any director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder,
affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of, or any financial advisor to
any of the foregoing (each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_ ") shall have any
liabilities or obligations (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations
or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance or breach. In no event
shall any Party or any of their respective Affiliates, and each Party agrees
not to and to cause their Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party. This Section 10.11
shall not restrict actions by the Company against the Acquirer Parties to
specifically enforce the obligations of the Acquirer Parties in this
Agreement, including Section 7.11.

  

 

75  

  

Section 10.12 _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement without notice or liability to any
other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated
with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties.
Consequently, persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  

Section 10.13 _Debt Financing Parties_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company and Parent, on behalf of themselves,
their respective Subsidiaries and each of their respective controlled
Affiliates hereby: (a) agrees that any suit, action, claim, complaint, formal
investigation or other proceeding (a " _Proceeding_ "), whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Debt
Financing Parties, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt
Financing or any of the agreements (including the Debt Commitment Letter)
entered into in connection with the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court
in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so long as such forum is and
remains available, and any appellate court thereof and irrevocably submits
itself and its property with respect to any such Proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court, (b) agrees that any such Proceeding shall be
governed by the laws of the State of New York (without giving effect to any
conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the laws
of another state), except as otherwise provided in the Debt Commitment Letter
or other applicable definitive document relating to the Debt Financing, (c)
agrees not to bring or support or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or
support any Proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Party in any way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder in any forum
other than any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York,
New York, (d) agrees that service of process upon the Company, its
Subsidiaries or its controlled Affiliates in any such Proceeding or proceeding
shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 10.3, (e)
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in any
such court, (f) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law trial by jury in any Proceeding brought
against the Debt Financing Parties in any way arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder, (g) agrees that none of the Debt Financing Parties will have any
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives (in each case, other than Parent, Holdco or
their respective Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation following
consummation of the Merger)) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder,
whether in law

  

  

 

76  

  

or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise and (h) agrees that
the Debt Financing Parties are express third party beneficiaries of, and may
enforce, any of the provisions of this Section 10.13, and that such provisions
and the definition of "Debt Financing Parties" shall not be amended in any way
adverse to the Debt Financing Parties without the prior written consent of the
Debt Financing Sources).
