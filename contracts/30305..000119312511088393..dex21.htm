ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01 _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with
and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in St. Louis, Missouri at the offices of
Armstrong Teasdale LLP, 7700 Forsyth Blvd., Suite 1800, St. Louis, Missouri
63105, as soon as possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days
after the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the
Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the
party or parties entitled to the benefit of such conditions, that is the
earlier of (a) any Business Day during the Marketing Period as may be
specified by Parent on no less than three Business Days prior notice to the
Company and (b) the final day of the Marketing Period, or at such other
place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree (the "Closing Date"); provided, that notwithstanding the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 9, this
Agreement may be terminated pursuant to and in accordance with Section 10.01
such that the parties shall not be required to effect the Closing, regardless
of whether the final day of the Marketing Period shall have occurred prior to
such termination.

(c) Upon the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall cause the Merger
to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as
is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
Delaware Law. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective
Time") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as permitted by Delaware Law
as Parent and the Company shall agree and shall be specified in the
Certificate of Merger).

 



9 (d) The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in
the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall possess all the properties, rights, powers, privileges and
franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities,
restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as
provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.02 _Conversion of Shares_ _._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary,
the Company or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or any
shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Subsidiary:

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.04, each
share of Company Common Stock (including each Company Restricted Share)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (together with the Company
Rights attached to each such share), shall be converted into the right to
receive $19.25 in cash, without interest (such per share amount, the "Merger
Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a
"Certificate") and each uncertificated share of Company Common Stock (an
"Uncertificated Share") which immediately prior to the Effective Time was
registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company, shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. For
avoidance of doubt, no Merger Consideration shall be paid under this Section
2.02(a) on account of any Performance Unit or any right or security into which
such Performance Unit converts as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and the settlement of Performance Units hereunder shall be
governed solely by the provisions of Section 2.05 hereof.

(b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time together with the Company Rights attached to each such
share shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;
and

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.03  _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Paying
Agent") for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration to the holders of
Company Common Stock and shall enter into a Paying Agent Agreement with the
Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause Merger Subsidiary to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit
(from and after the Effective Time) of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for payment in accordance with this Section 2.03 through the Paying
Agent, cash sufficient to pay the

 



10  aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.02. All cash deposited
with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(a) shall herewith be
referred to as the "Payment Fund". Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
any event within two Business Days following the Closing Date), Parent shall
send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each Person who was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to receive payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.02(a) a letter of transmittal and instructions (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent) for use in such payment.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated
Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective
Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon
the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented
to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive only the Merger
Consideration to the extent provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article 2. 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent or otherwise on the instruction of Parent, and any such
holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, in
respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to

 



11  such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_ _. _ Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted
in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly
demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware
Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. From and after the Effective Time,
a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not have, and shall not be entitled to
exercise, any of the voting rights or other rights of a holder of shares of
the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Section 262 of
Delaware Law, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall have the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

Section 2.05  _Stock Options and Other Equity Awards_.

(a) _Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option
under any Stock Plan, including without limitation the 1993 Option Plan, the
1995 Option Plan and the 1999 Option Plan, whether or not then exercisable or
vested, shall become fully vested and be cancelled in exchange for the right
to receive, within ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time, an amount
in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under
such Company Stock Option, less any applicable taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment. As used herein, the term "Company Stock Option"
shall mean any outstanding option to purchase shares of capital stock of the
Company under any Stock Plan. As of the Effective Time, all Company Stock
Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist
and shall become only the right to receive the option consideration described
in this Section 2.05(a), and, without limiting the foregoing, the Board of
Directors of the Company or the appropriate committee thereof shall take all
necessary action to effect such cancellation, including but not limited to
adopting any required amendment to any of the Stock Plans, and obtaining any
required participant consents.

 

(b) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company or the compensation
committee of the Board of Directors of the Company will adopt such resolutions
and take such other reasonable actions as may be required to provide that with
respect to the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"): (A)
participants in the ESPP may not alter their payroll deductions from those in
effect on the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their
participation in the ESPP), (B) no offering period will be commenced after
the date of this Agreement (it being understood that the current offering(s)
in progress as of the date hereof shall continue, and shares of

 



12  Company Common Stock shall be issued to participants thereunder on the next
currently scheduled purchase date thereunder occurring after the date hereof
as provided under, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the ESPP), (C)
in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, any offering in progress as of the
Effective Time shall be shortened, and the "Offering Termination Date" (as
defined in the ESPP) shall be the Business Day immediately preceding the
Effective Time, (D) each then outstanding option under the ESPP shall be
exercised automatically on such Offering Termination Date, (E) the ESPP shall
be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and (F) the
amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant under the ESPP as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to
purchase shares of capital stock of the Company in accordance with the ESPP,
be refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time (without interest). Notwithstanding any restrictions on
transfer of stock in the ESPP, the treatment in the Merger of any stock
purchased pursuant to the ESPP as described under this provision shall be in
accordance with Section 2.02(a).

(c) _Performance Units_. At the Effective Time, the performance objectives
underlying all Performance Units that are outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be achieved at the maximum level,
pursuant to the terms of the 2004 LTIP as described in Section 4.27, as
amended prior to the date upon which the Companys Board of Directors approved
this Agreement. At such time, such Performance Units shall not be converted
into Company Restricted Shares, but rather shall be converted into the
unvested right (the "Unvested Cash Right") to receive, upon vesting, an amount
in cash equal to (i) the number of Performance Units _multiplied by_ (ii)
$1.50. The Unvested Cash Rights shall vest on the 12-month anniversary of the
Closing Date, provided that the holder thereof has been continuously employed
by Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) through such
date, or shall vest on such earlier date as may be provided under the terms
of the 2004 LTIP as described in Section 4.27, as amended prior to the date
upon which the Companys Board of Directors approves this Agreement. The
amount of cash to which the holder of any such Unvested Cash Right
is entitled shall be paid, without interest, within ten (10) calendar days
after the vesting thereof. All amounts payable pursuant to the Unvested Cash
Rights are intended to be "short-term deferrals" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), and accordingly, are intended to
be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code,
the regulations and other guidance of general applicability thereunder, and
any state law of similar effect (collectively, "Section 409A"), and
accordingly, no payment of the cash underlying Unvested Cash Rights will be
subject to the additional income tax under Section 409A, and any ambiguities
herein will be interpreted to be so exempt. If the Closing Date occurs after
July 3, 2011, in no event will Performance Units (other than Performance Units
held by an employee with an employment agreement described in Section 4.27)
with a performance period which ends on such date be converted into an
Unvested Cash Right under this Section 2.05(c). Instead, to the extent such
Performance Units are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time due
to the fact that the Company has not had sufficient time after the end of
such fiscal year to convert such Performance Units into Company Restricted
Shares in accordance with the terms of the 2004 LTIP, such Performance Units
shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive, within ten (10)
Business Days after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product
of (a) the number of Performance Units subject to an award and (B) $1.50.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.05(c) (except for the first
sentence of this Section 2.05(c)) to the contrary, Performance Units,
including those Performance Units which are fully

 



13  earned as of July 3, 2011, held by an employee with an employment agreement
described in Exhibit C, D, E or F to Section 4.27, which have not been
converted into Company Restricted Shares as of Closing, shall be considered
outstanding and converted into Unvested Cash Rights pursuant to this Section
2.05. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.05(c) (except for the first
sentence of this Section 2.05(c)) to the contrary, Performance Units,
including those Units which are fully earned as of July 3, 2011, held by an
employee with an employment agreement described in Exhibit A or B to Section
4.27, which have not been converted into Company Restricted Shares as of
Closing, shall be settled in accordance with the terms of such employment
agreement.

 

Section 2.06 _Adjustments_ _._ If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock shall occur, as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), merger,
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other
similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of
such event on the Merger Consideration or any such other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.07 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under any provision of any Applicable Law, including federal,
state, local or foreign Tax law, and if any such amounts are deducted and
withheld, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as the
case may be, timely pay such amounts to the appropriate Government Authority.
If the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

Section 2.08 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

ARTICLE 3

 

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

Section 3.01 _Articles of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation of
the Company shall be amended in its entirety as set forth on Annex I and, as
amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law.

 



14 Section 3.02 _Bylaws_. The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended
in accordance with Applicable Law.

Section 3.03  _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the
officers of the Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time shall be the officers
of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE 4

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (i) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with or furnished
to the SEC by the Company since June 28, 2009 and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement ("Filed Company SEC Documents") (other than any
disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, any disclosures of risks
included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature), or
(ii) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule (it being agreed that
disclosure of any information in a particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any
other section or subsection of this Agreement to which the relevance of such
information is readily apparent on its face), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent that:

Section 4.01 _Corporate Existence and Power_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation and has all
corporate powers required to carry on its business as conducted as of the date
hereof. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where such qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where
failure to be so qualified has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Prior to the date of this
Agreement, the Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies
of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement, and each as so
delivered is in full force and effect. The Company is not in violation of any
provision of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

 

Section 4.02 _Corporate Authorization_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the affirmative vote of the
holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in
connection with the consummation of the Merger (the "Company Stockholder
Approval"), to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Subsidiary,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its

 



15  terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights
generally and general principles of equity). The Company Stockholder Approval
is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys
capital stock or other securities required in connection with the consummation
of the Merger. No vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys
capital stock or other securities is required in connection with the
consummation of any of transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated by
the Company other than the Merger.

 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Companys Board of Directors (or a
duly appointed committee thereof) has (i) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of
the Companys stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) approved and
adopted all actions necessary to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv)
resolved to recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys stockholders (such recommendation, the "Company Board
Recommendation").

 

Section 4.03 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which
the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the HSR Act and under any comparable merger control laws of
foreign jurisdictions, if applicable (the consents, approvals orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings required under or in
connection with any of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) above, the "Required
Governmental Authorizations"), (iii) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, and any other applicable U.S.
state or federal securities laws, (iv) compliance with any requirements of the
AMEX and (v) any actions or filings the absence of which would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

Section 4.04 _Non-contravention_. Except as set forth on Section 4.04 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance by the

Branch (collectively, the "Lender"), including any schedules, exhibits and
annexes thereto and excerpts of the engagement letter associated therewith
(the "Engagement Letter") that contain any conditions to funding or "flex"
provisions, and a copy of the fee letter associated therewith (the "Fee
Letter") with only fee amounts and "flex" provisions redacted (the Fee Letter,
together with such commitment letter and any schedules, exhibits and annexes
thereto, collectively, the "Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which the lender
parties thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to

warrants that the Engagement Letter and the "flex" provisions of the Fee
Letter do not permit the imposition of any new conditions (or the expansion

result in net cash proceeds less than the amount that would be required to
consummate the Merger. As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment
Letter has not been amended, restated or otherwise modified and neither Parent

contained in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or
rescinded. As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full

or default under the Commitment Letter by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or, to

As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary has
any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated

representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement or the failure

hereby on a timely basis, nor is there any Order outstanding against, or, to
the

 



41  knowledge of Parent, investigation by any Governmental Authority or

investigation and analysis, and each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary
acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties of the

opportunities, welfare benefits and perquisites (excluding equity and equity
based incentive compensation) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to

Section 6.02 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

(a) Subject to Section 6.02(b), the Company shall not, and shall cause the
Companys Subsidiaries not to, and shall not knowingly permit or authorize its
and their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants and other authorized agents, advisors or
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, 

 



45  initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any information relating to the Company or any of

(iv) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement
with respect to any voting securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (v) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent,

instruct their respective Representatives to, (A) cease immediately and
terminate any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if
any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) instruct any such Third Party (or
its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information about the
Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company to return or destroy
all such information and (C) subject to Section 6.02(b), not terminate,
waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it or any of its Affiliates or Representatives
is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and enforce the
provisions of any such agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the adoption of
this Agreement by Companys stockholders, the Board of Directors of the
Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, may, subject to compliance with Section 6.02(c), (i) engage in
negotiations or discussions (including, as a part thereof, making any
counterproposal or counter offer to) with any Third Party that, subject to the
Companys compliance with Section 6.02(a), has made after the date of this
Agreement a Superior Proposal or a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company believes in good faith
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel) is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to any Third Party that, subject to
the Companys compliance with Section 6.02(a), has made after the date of this
Agreement a Superior Proposal, nonpublic information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms
no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; provided that all such information (to the extent that
such information has not been previously provided or made available to
Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to
or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available
to such Third Party), (iii) terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of
its Affiliates or Representatives is a party with respect to any Superior
Proposal; and (iv) make an Adverse Recommendation Change, but in each case
referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) only if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel to the Company, that failure to take such action would
likely result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, taking
into account all adjustments to the

 



46  terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent pursuant to Section
6.02(c). Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the
Company from complying with requirements Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act or
complying with the requirements of Rule 14d-9 under the 1934 Act with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal, so long as any action taken or statement made to
so comply is consistent with this Section 6.02(b) provided, however, that in
no event shall this sentence affect the obligations of the Company otherwise
specified in Sections 6.02(a), (b) and (c). For the avoidance of doubt, a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d 9(f) under the 1934 Act, an express rejection of any applicable
Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Companys
recommendation to the stockholders of the Company in favor of the Merger
shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change (including for
purposes of Section 10.01(c)(i)).

 

(c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions
referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 6.02(b) unless (i) the
Company shall have delivered to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior
written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new two
Business Day period), (ii) prior to the expiration of such three Business Day
period (or two Business Day period, as applicable), Parent does not make a
proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) to be at least as favorable as the
Superior Proposal after giving effect to, among other things, the payment of
the Company Termination Fee set forth in Section 11.04(b), such that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines that the failure to take such action
is no longer likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law, and (iii) the Company shall
continue to advise Parent after delivery of such notice of the status and
material terms of any discussions and negotiations with the Third Party.
During the three Business Day period (or two Business Day period, as
applicable) prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), the Company shall,
and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any
revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but
in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry that would be
reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that to the knowledge of the Company
may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, which notice
shall be provided in writing and shall identify the material terms and
conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request (including
any material changes thereto and the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal) and shall be accompanied by a copy of any written
Acquisition Proposal and a copy of the relevant Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, if applicable, and any other relevant transaction documents with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed
(in writing) in all material respects on a timely basis of the status and
details (including, within 24 hours after the occurrence of any amendment,
modification, development, discussion or negotiation) of any

 



47  such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, including furnishing copies
of any additional written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation.

 

"Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal for at least 66.67% of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into
account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal would result
in a transaction (i) that if consummated, is more favorable to Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger or, if
applicable, any binding proposal by Parent capable of being accepted by the
Company to amend the terms of this Agreement taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including the expected
timing and likelihood of consummation, taking into account any governmental
and other approval requirements, and including any break-up fees and expense
reimbursement provisions), (ii) that is reasonably likely to be completed on
the terms proposed, taking into account the identity of the person making the
proposal, any approval requirements and all other financial, legal and other
aspects of such proposal and (iii) for which financing, if a cash transaction
(whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Board of Directors of the Company.

(d) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.02 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by the Company. The materiality of any such breach
shall be determined under Applicable Law based on the facts and circumstances
of any such breach.

(e) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict the Companys ability to comply with any of the
terms of this Section 6.02, and represents that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement.

(f) The Company shall not take any action to (i) exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates) from the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the
Delaware (or any similar provision of any other Applicable Law) or otherwise
cause such restrictions not to apply or (ii) amend or waive the Company
Rights Agreement, redeem the Company Rights or exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates) from the Company
Rights Agreement, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless
such actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i).

Section 6.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time and subject to
Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, upon
reasonable notice and request, (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors, Financing Sources and other authorized representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to its offices,

 



48  properties, books and records, including, but not limited to, for purposes
of continuing their due diligence of the Company and without limitation for
matters relating to export controls and government contracts, (ii) furnish to
Parent and its counsel such financial and operating data and other information
as such Persons may reasonably request and a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and
(iii) instruct its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives to cooperate with Parent in its investigation. Any
investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this Section shall, prior to
the Effective Time, require the Company to take any action that would, in the
good faith judgment of the Company, constitute a waiver of the attorney-client
or similar privilege or trade secret protection held by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or violate confidentiality obligations owing to third
parties; provided, however, that the Company shall make a good faith effort to
accommodate any request from Parent for access or information pursuant to this
Section in a manner that does not result in such a waiver or violation. All
information furnished pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of November 22, 2010, between Parent and
the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

(b) The Company shall deliver to Parent monthly consolidated and consolidating
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries within 15 calendar
days of the end of each fiscal month.

Section 6.04 _Stockholder Action_ _._ From the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, the Company shall not settle or offer to settle any
stockholder Action against the Company and/or its directors or executive
officers relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereunder, without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to keep Parent informed with respect to status of,
and any material developments in, any such Action.

Section 6.05 _FIRPTA Certificate_ _._ On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Parent an
affidavit satisfying the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(c)(3) in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent;
it being understood that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, if the Company fails to provide Parent with such certification, the
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
withhold the requisite amount from consideration otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement in accordance with Section 1445 of the Code and the
applicable Treasury Regulations and Section 2.07 hereof and that any amount so
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding.

Section 7.01 _Conduct of Parent_ _._ From the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, except with the Companys prior written consent, Parent

before, the Effective Time or would materially delay the Closing. From the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall
cause Merger Subsidiary not to (i) intentionally take any action
(or intentionally omit to take any action) that would, to the knowledge of
the Parent at the time the action is taken, result in any of the conditions
set forth in Article 9 not to be satisfied; or (ii) intentionally take any
action (or omit to take any action) that would, to the knowledge of Parent at
the time the action is taken, materially and adversely affect Parents and
Merger Subsidiarys ability to consummate the Financing.

action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under

"Indemnified Person") against any costs or expenses (including advancing
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Person to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law; provided, however, that such advance shall
be conditioned upon the Surviving Companys receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall be
ultimately determined by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this
Section 7.04(a)), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, arbitration, proceeding or investigation in respect of or
arising out of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law
or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Companys articles of
incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof; provided that such
indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time
under Applicable Law. In the event of any such action, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the
defense of any such action.

occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each Indemnified Person
covered as of the date of this Agreement by the Companys DandO Insurance
policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement (or a six-year
prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to Parent
providing coverage benefits and terms no less favorable to the Indemnified
Persons than the Companys current such policy; for the avoidance of doubt,
the Company may purchase such "tail policy" at its option prior to the
Effective Time, and, in such case Parent shall cause such policy to be in full
force and effect for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by the Surviving Corporation); _provided_ that, in satisfying its
obligation under this Section 7.04(c), the Surviving Corporation shall not be

merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the Organizational Documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or any other
Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation
of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person.

Section 7.05 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Subject to Section 2.05, Parent shall make payments in such amounts and
to such Company employees as set forth on Section 7.05(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule pursuant to the Companys 2004 LTIP at the time such
payments would be paid under such plan in accordance with its terms. Parent
shall make payments to Company employees eligible to participate in the
Companys 2011 annual incentive plan as of the date of this Agreement at the
ordinary time such payments would otherwise be paid under such plan in
accordance with its

 



51  terms, provided that all such payments shall be based on the amounts accrued
as expense relating to such bonus plan on the Companys financial statements,
but in no event shall such amount exceed $3,900,000.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates in which any Current Employee first becomes eligible to
participate, on or after the Effective Time (the "Parent Plans"), Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) during the period commencing on the
Effective Date and ending on December 31, 2011 waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such Current Employee under any health and
welfare Parent Plans in which such Current Employee may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time; and (ii) credit Current Employees with
service for time worked for the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting
credit under (but not for the purposes of benefit accrual under) any such
Parent Plan to the extent permitted under the terms of such Parent Plan,
provided, however, that in no event shall any credit be given to the extent it
would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

Section 8.01 _Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Material_ _._ As promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in any event within 15
Business Days after the date hereof), the Company shall file the Company
Proxy Statement with the SEC in preliminary form as required by the 1934 Act,
and shall use all reasonable efforts to have the Company Proxy Statement
cleared by the SEC. The Company shall obtain and furnish the information
required to be included in the Proxy Statement, shall provide Parent and
Merger Subsidiary with any comments that may be received from the SEC or its
staff with respect thereto, shall respond promptly to any such comments made
by the SEC or its staff with respect to the Company Proxy Statement, and
shall cause the Company Proxy Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the
Companys stockholders at the earliest practicable date. If at any time prior

the Merger, the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers should be discovered by the Company or
Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Company
Proxy Statement so that such document would not contain any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall promptly file with the
SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to
the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel. The

reasonably practicable after the Company Proxy Statement is

 



52  cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Companys stockholders for the purpose
of voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger.
Except in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted
by Section 6.02(b), the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) recommend
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Companys
stockholders, (ii) include such recommendation in the Company Proxy Statement
and (iii) publicly reaffirm such recommendation to its stockholders at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting after a request
to do so by Parent or Merger Subsidiary; provided, however, if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal and Parent requests that the Company reaffirm
its recommendation less than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall have the right to postpone the Company
Stockholder Meeting to the seventh (7th) Business Day from the date of
Parents request to reaffirm its recommendation. An Adverse Recommendation
Change made in compliance with Section 6.02(b) will not constitute a breach by
the Company of this Agreement. In connection with such meeting, the Company
shall (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval and (ii) otherwise comply in all material respects with
all legal requirements applicable to such meeting.

Section 8.02 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

advisable under Applicable Law to consummate in the most expeditious manner
possible the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i)
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable with any Governmental
Authority or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of

other third parties that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fulfill the conditions to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) defending any actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings threatened or commenced by any
Governmental Authority or arbitrator relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining
order or preliminary injunction entered by any Governmental Authority or
arbitrator vacated or reversed, and (iv) cooperating to the extent reasonable
with the other parties hereto in their efforts to comply with their
obligations under this Agreement. 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and all other filings required (1) under any applicable non-US
antitrust or competition laws (together with the HSR Filings, the "Antitrust
Filings") and (2) under any other applicable competition, merger control,
antitrust or similar law that the Company and Parent deem advisable or
appropriate with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable and in any event within fifteen (15)

 



53  Business Days of the date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to use their reasonable best efforts to
take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. In
addition, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or
cause to be taken all actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain any
consent, waiver, approval or authorizations relating to the HSR Act or similar
non-US laws that are required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which efforts shall include, without
limitation, the proffer by Parent of its willingness to accept an order
providing for the divestiture by Parent of such of its assets and businesses
as are necessary to fully consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and an offer to hold separate such assets and businesses pending
such divestiture. In the event that the FTC or the DOJ or any other
Governmental Authority or arbitrator requires the divestiture or the holding
separate by Parent of any assets, no adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration and Parent shall be required to hold such assets separate, or to
divest them, as the case may be, following the Closing.

 

Section 8.03 _Certain Filings_.

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection
with the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement, (ii) in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be obtained from parties to any material Contracts, in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iii) in taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing
information required in connection therewith or with the Company Proxy
Statement and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals
or waivers. 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other party of
any communication it receives from any Governmental Authority or arbitrator
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the
other party to review in advance any proposed communication by such party to
any Governmental Authority or arbitrator and shall provide each other with
copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of
their representatives and any Governmental Authority or arbitrator. Neither
Parent nor the Company shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority or arbitrator in respect of any such filings,
investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority or
arbitrator, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting.

press conference or conference call before such consultation.

 



54 Section 8.05 _Stock Exchange De-listing_ _._ Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially reasonable

Applicable Laws and rules and policies of AMEX to enable the de-listing by

Section 8.07 _Notice of Certain Events_ _._ Each of the Company and Parent

(a) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority or
arbitrator in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(b) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement that could reasonably
be expected to give rise to a risk of termination set forth in Section
10.01(c)(ii) or Section 10.01(d)(ii), as the case may be; and

(c) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of termination set forth
in Section 10.01(c)(ii) or Section 10.01(d)(ii), as the case may be;

_provided, however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
8.07 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving that notice.

Section 8.09 _Financing_.

(a) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts to
arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment
Letter or on other terms that would not adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Merger Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including using reasonable best efforts (taking into account

 



55  the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period) to (i) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained therein (including any "market flex" provisions) or on other terms
reasonably acceptable to Parent and not in violation of this Section 8.09,
(ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions and covenants applicable to
Parent in the Commitment Letter that are within its control and otherwise
comply with its obligations thereunder, (iii) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letter until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, (iv) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter, and (v)
subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
consummate the Financing at the Closing. Parent shall have the right from time
to time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any
of its rights under, the Commitment Letter, and/or substitute other debt
financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or
alternative Financing Sources, including without limitation to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had
not executed the Financing Commitment as of the date of this Agreement;
provided, that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification to or waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter that
amends the Financing and/or substitution of all or any portion of the
Financing shall not (i) impose any additional conditions precedent or expand
upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Commitment
Letter, (ii) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or (iii)
prevent or impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall be permitted to
reduce the amount of Financing under the Commitment Letter in its reasonable
discretion; provided, that Parent shall not reduce the Financing to an amount
committed below the amount that is required, together with other financial
resources of Parent and Merger Subsidiary including cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company and the
Companys Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, to consummate the Merger on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement; and provided further, that such
reduction shall not (i) impose any additional conditions precedent or expand
upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Commitment
Letter, (ii) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or (iii)
prevent or impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the syndication of the Financing to the extent permitted by the
Commitment Letter shall not be deemed to violate Parents obligations under
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice: (A) of any material breach or
material default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
material breach or material default) by any party to any Commitment Letter or
definitive document related to the Financing of which Parent or its Affiliates
becomes aware; (B) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Person with respect to any: (x) actual or potential
material breach, material default, termination or repudiation by any party to
any Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing or
any provisions of the Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to
the Financing or (y) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to
the Financing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course
negotiations with respect to the terms of the Financing or any definitive
agreement with respect thereto); and (C) if for any reason Parent or Merger
Sub believes in good 

 



56  faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment
Letter or the definitive documents related to the Financing; provided, that
in no event will Parent or Merger Subsidiary be under any obligation to
disclose any information that is reasonably believed to be subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege or that is requested for purposes of
litigation. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within three
(3) Business Days after the date the Company delivers Parent or Merger Sub a
written request, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence,
and subject to the proviso of the immediately preceding sentence. In the event
any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Commitment Letter (including any "market flex"
provisions), Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions not
materially less favorable to Parent and Merger Subsidiary in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any
such alternative financing, any amended or substitute financing permitted by
this Section 8.09(a), and the Financing, an "Available Financing"). In the
event that on the final day of the Marketing Period (i) all or any portion of
the Financing structured as High Yield Financing has not been consummated,
(ii) all closing conditions contained in Article 9 shall have been satisfied
or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature will not be
satisfied until the Closing) and (iii) all conditions to the Bridge Financing
set forth in the Commitment Letter have been satisfied, then Parent shall
borrow under and use the proceeds of the Bridge Financing (or such alternative
bridge financing) to replace such affected portion of the High Yield
Financing on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else
set forth herein, the Company hereby acknowledges that it shall have no claims
(contractual or otherwise) against any Financing Source relating to the Merger
or the Financing.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Financing Sources" means the entities that
have committed to provide or otherwise entered into agreements in connection
with the Financing or any other Available Financing, including the parties to
the Commitment Letter and any joinder agreements or definitive agreements
relating thereto.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Marketing Period" shall mean the period of 35
consecutive calendar days commencing on the later of the date that both (i)
Parent shall have received the Required Information and (ii) the Company has
mailed to its stockholders the Company Proxy Statement; provided, that to the
extent Parent receives the Required Information prior to the date that the
Company Proxy Statement is mailed to the Companys stockholders, such 35 day
period shall be reduced, but not by more than ten days, by the number of days
in advance of such mailing date that the Required Information is delivered to
Parent and provided, further, that (A)(1) throughout and at the end of such 35
day period such Required Information shall at all times remain compliant with
applicable provisions of Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the
1933 Act, (2) throughout and at the end of such 35 day period nothing has
occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set
forth in Section 9.02 to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be
scheduled for any time during such 35 consecutive calendar day period and (3)
at the end of such 35 day period the conditions set forth in Section 9.01
shall be satisfied; provided, that such 35 consecutive calendar day period
must (x) end on or prior to June 30, 2011, (y) begin on or after July 5, 2011
and end on or prior to August 19, 2011 or (z) begin on or after September 3,
2011; provided, further that if the 

 



57  Company has mailed to its stockholders the Company Proxy Statement on or
prior to June 21, 2011 and the Required Information is delivered by June 18,
2011, the Marketing Period will be reduced to 15 consecutive Business Days
solely for the period beginning on July 5, 2011 and ending on July 25, 2011,
(B) the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on
which the Financing, including the High-Yield Financing (other than any
portion of the Financing that constituted Bridge Financing with respect to
such High-Yield Financing) is consummated and (C) the Marketing Period shall
not be deemed to have commenced if after the date hereof and prior to the
completion of the Marketing Period:

(1) the Companys outside auditor shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with
respect to any financial statements contained in the Companys most recently
filed Annual Report on Form 10-K (including, if applicable, the Company 10-K)
contained in the Required Information, in which case the Marketing Period
shall not be deemed to commence unless and until, at the earliest, a new
unqualified audit opinion is issued with respect to the consolidated financial
statements of the Company for the applicable periods by the Companys outside
auditor or another independent public accounting firm;

(2) the Company issues a public statement indicating that it is restating,
or intends to restate, any historical financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Documents or that any such restatement is under
consideration or may be a possibility, in which case the Marketing Period
shall not be deemed to commence unless and until such restatement has been
completed and the relevant Company SEC Document or SEC Documents has or have
been amended or the Company has announced that it has concluded that no
restatement shall be required in accordance with applicable law; or

(3) the Company shall have been delinquent in filing any Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K, in which case the Marketing Period
will not be deemed to commence unless and until any such delinquency has been
cured.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries,
and its and their respective Representatives (except for those Representatives
which are not employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any
outside legal and accounting Representatives, in which case the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such
Representatives) to provide to Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the
Financing Sources all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and/or the
Financing Sources that is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with
any Available Financing and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation (i) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as
lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, any
Available Financing), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies, and cooperating with the
marketing efforts of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Financing Sources, in
each case in connection with any Available Financing, (ii) assisting in the
preparation of (y) any offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with any Available Financing, including the syndication thereof;
provided that any such assistance shall include execution and delivery of
customary representation letters in connection with bank information
memoranda, and (z) materials for rating agency presentations, (iii) as
promptly as practical,

 



58  furnishing Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Financing Sources with
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including (x) all
financial statements, pro forma financial information, financial data, audit
reports and other information of the type required by Regulation S-X and
Regulation S-K under the 1933 Act for registered offerings of debt securities
and of the type and form customarily included in offering documents used in
private placements pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act for companies such
as the Company or Parent (including, to the extent applicable with respect to
such financial statements, the report of the Companys auditors thereon and
related management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations) to consummate any offering of debt securities contemplated by
the Commitment Letter or any Available Financing, assuming that such offering
was consummated at the same time during the Companys fiscal year as the
offering of debt securities contemplated by the Commitment Letter or any
Available Financing (provided that in no circumstance shall the Company be
required to provide subsidiary financial statements or any other information
of the type required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X,
Compensation Disclosure and Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b)
or other information customarily excluded from a Rule 144A offering
memorandum), and (y) such other information and data as are otherwise
necessary in order to receive customary "comfort" letters with respect to the
financial statements and data referred to in the preceding clause (iii)(x)
(including "negative assurance" comfort) from the independent auditors of the
Company and its Subsidiaries on any date during the relevant period (all such
information in this clause (iii), the "Required Information"), (iv) subject to
customary confidentiality arrangements reasonably acceptable to the Company,
providing due diligence materials reasonably requested by the Financing
Sources in connection with any Available Financing, (v) upon Parents
reasonable request, using reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants
comfort letters, customary accountants consents for use of their reports
in connection with offerings of securities under the 1933 Act (including Rule
144A thereunder), legal opinions, hedging agreements, appraisals, surveys,
engineering reports, title insurance and other documentation and items
relating to any Available Financing, (vi) executing and delivering, as of the
Effective Time (and only effective as of the Effective Time), any definitive
agreements in respect of any Available Financing, including any pledge and
security documents or other certificates, documents and instruments relating
to guarantees, the pledge of collateral and other matters ancillary to such
Available Financing (including a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters and consents
of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to such
Available Financing) as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection
with such Available Financing, and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
pledging of collateral (including cooperation in connection with the pay-off
of the Companys existing indebtedness and the release of related Liens) and
providing the guarantees contemplated by any Available Financing, (vii)
taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit the Financing Sources
to evaluate Companys current assets, cash management and accounting systems,
policies and procedures relating thereto for the purposes of establishing
collateral arrangements and (B) prepare deposit account or other control
agreements in connection with the foregoing, (viii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain landlord consents, waivers, consents, estoppels,
surveys, title insurance and approvals from other parties to material

to the extent required to effect any Available Financing, (ix) using
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Financing Sources benefit
from the existing

 



59  lending relationships of Company and its Subsidiaries, (x) requesting
customary payoff letters, Lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be
delivered to allow for the payoff, discharge and termination in full on the
Closing Date of all indebtedness and Liens under indebtedness of the Company
required to be repaid as of the Effective Time by the terms of any Available
Financing, (xi) furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources promptly with all
documentation and other information required by any Governmental Authority
with respect to any Available Financing under applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act,
and in any event at least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, and (xii)
taking all corporate actions reasonably requested by Parent as are necessary
to permit the consummation of any Available Financing, including the
preparation, execution and delivery of resolutions, the holding of any
necessary board meetings, and the amendment of any organizational document,
and to permit the proceeds of any Available Financing, together with the cash
at the Company and its Subsidiaries, to be made available to Parent on the
Closing Date to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (it being
understood that no resolutions, amendment or availability of cash shall become
effective until prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, prior to
the Effective Time occurs, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
(A) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or (B) execute and
deliver any definitive agreement or any other customary closing documents with
respect to any Available Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding, nothing
herein shall require any such cooperation to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. The Company will periodically update any such Required
Information to be included in an offering document to be used in connection
with any Available Financing in order to ensure that such Required
Information does not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
therein not misleading. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the
Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries names, marks
and logos and the dissemination of Required Information (subject to customary
confidentiality provisions) in connection with any Available Financing;
provided, that any such names, marks and logos are used, and the Required
Information is disseminated, solely in a manner that is not intended or not
reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective intellectual property rights.

specify for the purpose by notice to the other parties hereto. All such
notices, requests and other communications shall be deemed received on the
date of receipt by the recipient thereof if received prior to 5:00 p.m. on a

Section 11.02 _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_ _._ The
representations and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or
other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time,
or except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02, upon termination of this
Agreement.

 

Section 11.03 _Amendments and Waivers_.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; _provided_ that, after the Company Stockholder Approval there shall
be no amendment or waiver that pursuant to Delaware Law requires further
Company Stockholder Approval without their further approval.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and
remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 

Section 11.04 _Expenses_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense; provided, however, the filing fees of the Notification and Report
Forms filed under the HSR Act

 



65  and any premerger notification and reports filed under similar applicable
antitrust law of any non United States Governmental Authority shall be shared
equally by Parent and the Company. 

(b) If a Company Payment Event (as hereinafter defined) occurs, the Company
shall pay Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) a fee
equal to $12,410,000 (the "Company Termination Fee"), less the amount of
Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent (if any) pursuant to this Section
11.04(b), it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required
to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. If, the Company
Payment Event is pursuant to clause (x) of the definition thereof, the Company
Termination Fee shall be paid simultaneously with the occurrence of such
Company Payment Event (and as a condition to the effectiveness of the
termination giving rise to such Company Payment Event) or, if the Company
Payment Event is pursuant to clauses (y) or (z) of the definition
thereof, the Company Termination Fee shall be paid within two Business Days
following the consummation of an Acquisition Proposal. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(b)(iii) under circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is not
then payable pursuant to this Section 11.04(b), then the Company shall
reimburse Parent and its Affiliates for all of their reasonable out-of-pocket
fees and expenses (including all fees and expenses of its Financing Sources,
counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to Parent
and Merger Sub and their Affiliates) incurred by Parent or Merger Subsidiary
or on their behalf in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation, investigation, negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement, the Financing and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Parent Expenses"), up to a maximum amount of $5,000,000;  _provided_ , that
the payment by the Company of the Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section
11.04(b), (i) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to
pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 11.04(b) and (ii)
shall not relieve the Company from any liability or damage resulting from an
intentional and material breach prior to such termination of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

"Company Payment Event" means the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to (x) Section 10.01(c)(i) or Section 10.01(d)(i), (y) Section 10.01(b)(i) or
(b)(iii) or (z) Section 10.01(c)(ii) under circumstances in which such breach
or failure to perform was intentional and material, but only if in the case
of clauses (y) and (z) (A) prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal
shall have been made to the Company or shall have otherwise been publicly
disclosed or proposed by a Third Party, and (B) within eighteen (18) months
following the date of such termination the Company enters into a definitive
Agreement with respect to a transaction described in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" or recommends or submits an Acquisition Proposal to
its stockholders, or a transaction in respect of an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, which, in each case, need not be the same Acquisition Proposal
that shall have been made, publicly disclosed or communicated prior to
termination hereof (provided, that for purposes of this definition only, all
references to 20% in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed
instead to be "50%").

 

(c) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 11.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if any party fails promptly to pay any
amounts due pursuant to this Section 11.04, and, in order to obtain such

 



66  payment, the owed party commences a suit that results in a judgment against
the owing party for the amounts set forth in this Section 11.04, the owing
party shall pay to the owed party its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 11.04 from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime
lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges
and agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that (i) the Company
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Subsidiary in the
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (ii) in the event
that the Company Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the Company
pursuant to this Section 11.04, the right to receive the Company Termination
Fee shall constitute each of Parents and Merger Subsidiarys and each of
their Affiliates and representatives sole and exclusive remedy.

Section 11.05 _Disclosure Schedule References_ _._ If and to the extent any
information required to be furnished in any Section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule is contained in this Agreement or in any other Section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, such information shall be deemed to be included
in all other Sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule in which the
information would otherwise be required to be included to the extent the
relevance of such disclosure to such Sections is readily apparent on its face.
Disclosure of any fact or item in any Section of the Company Disclosure
Schedules shall not be considered an admission by the disclosing party that
such item or fact (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or
greater significance) represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or
that such item or fact will in fact exceed any applicable threshold limitation
set forth in the Agreement and shall not be construed as an admission by the
disclosing party of any non-compliance with, or violation of, any third party
rights (including but not limited to any intellectual property rights) or any
Applicable Law of any Governmental Authority, such disclosures having been
made solely for the purposes of creating exceptions to the representations
made herein or of disclosing any information required to be disclosed under
the Agreement.

Section 11.06  _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except
as provided in Section 7.04 shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. (i) Except as provided in Section
7.04 and Section 7.05 and (ii) to the extent the Effective Time
occurs, except for the rights of the holders of Company Common Stock, Company
Restricted Shares, Company Stock Options and Performance Units under Article 2
of this Agreement to receive payment therefor, no provision of this Agreement
is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or
liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
hereto agree that any Financing Source shall be an intended third party
beneficiary of (i)

 



67  the last sentence of the first paragraph of Section 8.09(a), (ii) Section
11.08 and (iii) Section 11.09.

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
other party hereto.

Section 11.07 _Governing Law_ _._ This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 

Section 11.08 _Jurisdiction_ _._ The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the Delaware Court of
Chancery or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal
court sitting in Delaware, so long as one of such courts shall have subject
matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause
of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a
transaction of business in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any
such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service
of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof).

 

Section 11.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_ _._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 

Section 11.10 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_ _._ This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. Delivery of a signed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement by facsimile or by PDF file (portable document format file) shall
be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a

 



68  counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall
have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication).

Section 11.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter thereof. 

Section 11.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority or arbitrator to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled, without posting a bond or similar indemnity, to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
parties acknowledge and agree that damages of a party shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the
extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a party and its stockholders
(taking into consideration relevant matters, including lost stockholder
premium, other combination opportunities and the time value of money), which
shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such party.

 



69 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.
