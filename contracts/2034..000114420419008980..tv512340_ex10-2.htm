1.4 _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not assume and shall not be
obligated to assume or be obliged to pay, perform or otherwise discharge any
Liability of any Seller, and each Seller shall be solely and exclusively

constitute an Excluded Liability;

  



  

(f) any Liability arising out of or incurred as a result of any
actual or alleged violation by any Seller of any Law prior to the Closing, or

(j) all Liabilities in respect of any employee or other service

or prior to the Closing Date, except for any Taxes of an Acquired
Subsidiary, in each case; and

1.5 _Assignments; Cure Amounts_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer
reserves the right, in consultation with Sellers, to amend or supplement, at
any time prior to five (5) days prior to the Sale Hearing (the " _Assumption
Deadline_ "), _Schedule 1.1(c)_ to add any contracts, so long as any such
contract to be added to _Schedule 1.1(c)_ (x) is not to be assumed or
available to be assumed pursuant to any other sale or transaction previously
approved by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Bankruptcy Case, and
(y) is added to such schedule(s) prior to the entry of any Order of the
Bankruptcy Court approving the rejection of such contract or lease, and
subject to the party to such contract or lease receiving information
evidencing Buyer's adequate assurance of future performance and having an
opportunity to object within seven (7) days or such other period of time set
forth in an Order of the Bankruptcy Court of the receipt of such information
to the assignment of such contract or lease on the ground that Buyer has not
demonstrated adequate assurance of future performance of such contract or
lease pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. Any contract added to
_Schedule 1.1(c)_ (to the extent consistent with the prior sentence) shall be
deemed an Assumed Contract. Each Seller shall transfer and assign all Buyer
Assumed Agreements (that such Seller is a party thereto and to the
extent assignable pursuant to Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code) to
Buyer, and Buyer shall assume all Buyer Assumed Agreements from a Seller that
is a party thereto, as of the Assumption Deadline pursuant to Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code and the Sale Order. In connection with and as a
prerequisite to such assignment and assumption, Buyer shall pay in full all
costs (as determined by such Seller that is party thereto based on the Books
and Records of such Seller or as otherwise determined by the
Bankruptcy Court) to cure all defaults under such Buyer Assumed Agreements to
the extent required by Section 365(b) of the Bankruptcy Code (such amounts,
the " _Cure Costs_ ") and Sellers shall have no Liability therefore. The Cure
Costs for each Buyer Assumed Agreement are set forth opposite the name of
each Buyer Assumed Agreement set forth on _Schedule 1.5_ , but for
the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the Cure Costs for any Buyer
Assumed Agreement are determined by the Bankruptcy Court to be higher than
the amounts listed on _Schedule 1.5_ , Buyer shall be fully responsible to pay
such higher Cure Costs.

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Sale Order shall provide that as of the Closing, each Seller
shall assign to Buyer the Buyer Assumed Agreements to which it is a party,
with each Buyer Assumed Agreement identified by its name and date (if
available), the other party to such Buyer Assumed Agreement and the address
of such party for notice purposes, all included on one or more exhibit(s)
attached to either the motion filed in connection with the Sale Order or one
or more motion(s) or notice(s) regarding such Seller's intention to have
such Buyer Assumed Agreement assumed by, and assigned to, Buyer. Such
exhibit(s) shall also (i) set forth the Cure Costs (if any) necessary to cure
any defaults under each Buyer Assumed Agreement and (ii) delineate a procedure
for transferring to Buyer the rights to any Purchased Deposits in the form of
cash or letters of credit on deposit with the other party to any Assumed Real
Property Lease.

  



  

(c) In the case of licenses, certificates, approvals,
authorizations, leases, Contracts and other commitments included in the
Purchased Assets that cannot be transferred or assigned effectively without
the consent of third parties, which consent has not been obtained prior to
the Closing (after giving effect to the Sale Order and the Bankruptcy Code),
Sellers shall, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, paid in advance, subject to
any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be required and the terms set
forth in _Section 5.4_ , cooperate with Buyer in endeavoring to obtain such
consent (or restructure the acquisition of the underlying asset and unwind
any associated agreements to enable the acquisition thereof) and this
Agreement shall not operate as an assignment thereof in violation of any such
license, certificate, approval, authorization, Real Property Lease, Contract
or other commitment. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall not be
obligated to pay any consideration to any third party from whom consent or
approval is requested or otherwise incur any out-of-pocket costs or expenses,
or to initiate any litigation or Proceedings to obtain any such consent or
approval.

  



  

1.6 _Further Assurances_.

  



  

(a) At the Closing, and at all times thereafter as may be necessary,
Sellers and Buyer shall, at Buyer's sole cost and expense, execute and
deliver such other instruments of transfer as shall be reasonably necessary to
vest in Buyer title to the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens), and such other instruments as shall be
reasonably necessary to evidence the assignment by Sellers and the assumption
by Buyer or its designee of the Assumed Liabilities, including the
Buyer Assumed Agreements. Each of Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, shall cooperate with one another to execute and deliver such
other documents and instruments as may be reasonably required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that
Sellers' compliance with its obligations under this _Section 1.6_ shall,
in each case, be conditioned upon Buyer's advancement of any expenses to be
incurred by Sellers in connection therewith. At the Closing, and at all times
thereafter as may be necessary, Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers, at
Parent's request, to facilitate the procurement, possession and return to
Sellers of any Excluded Assets, including any equipment subject to any
lease which does not constitute an Assumed Equipment Lease.

  



  

(b) At the Closing, and at all times thereafter as may be necessary,
Sellers shall, at the reasonable request and expense of Buyer,
execute, deliver, and file, or cause to be executed, delivered, and filed,
such other instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such other actions
as Buyer may reasonably request, in order to more effectively consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to vest in Buyer good and marketable
title to the Intellectual Property included in the Purchased Assets, including
executing, filing, and recording, with all appropriate intellectual property
registration authorities and other relevant entities, all
assignment instruments and other filings that are necessary to correctly
record the prior chain of title with respect to ownership of the Intellectual
Property included in the Purchased Assets.

1.7 _Bulk Sales Laws_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Sellers
with the requirements and provisions of any "bulk-transfer" Law of any
jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any
or all of the Purchased Assets to Buyer. Pursuant to Section 363(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code, the transfer of the Purchased Assets shall be free and clear
of any and all Liens and Liabilities in the Purchased Assets (other than
Permitted Liens), including any Liens or claims arising out of any
bulk- transfer Laws, and the Parties shall take such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to so provide in the Sale Order.

  



  

ARTICLE II _ 
 PURCHASE PRICE_

  



  

2.1 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate consideration for the Purchased
Assets (the " _Base Purchase Price_ ") shall be the sum of the following:

  



  

(a) the Good Faith Deposit; _plus_

  



  

(b) (i) cash in the amount of three hundred four million two hundred
thousand dollars ($304,200,000), _plus_ the amount, if any, by which Net
Current Assets exceeds one hundred twenty-six million one hundred eighty-one
thousand eight hundred seven dollars ($126,181,807),  _minus_ (ii) the
amount, if any, by which Net Current Assets are less than one hundred twenty-
six million one hundred eighty-one thousand eight hundred seven dollars
($126,181,807), minus (iii) Net Debt (such amount, as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 2.4_  below, the " _Cash Balance_ "); _plus_

  



  

(c) the Cure Costs; _plus_

  



  

(d) the assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities.

  



  

2.2 _Closing Date Payment_. At the Closing, Buyer shall satisfy the
Base Purchase Price as follows:

  



  

(a) Buyer shall deliver the Estimated Cash Balance _less_ the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, via wire transfer of immediately available
funds into the account(s) designated in writing by Parent;

  



  

(b) Buyer shall deposit an amount equal to ten million dollars
($10,000,000) (the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") via wire transfer of
immediately available funds into an escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow_
") with Citibank, N.A. or such other financial institution as shall be
satisfactory to Parent and Buyer (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), to be held and
disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and an escrow agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") with the
Escrow Agent, such escrow agreement to be mutually acceptable to the Parties.
The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be borne and paid by Buyer;

  



  

(c) Buyer shall pay directly to the obligees identified on _Schedule
1.5_ the Cure Costs; and

  



  

(d) Buyer shall assume the Assumed Liabilities; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that to the extent any such Assumed Liabilities are able to be
satisfied at Closing, without preventing the transfer of the Purchased Assets
or the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, Buyer shall satisfy such
Assumed Liabilities either at Closing or, in Buyer's sole discretion, in the
ordinary course of business.

2.3 _Good Faith Deposit_. On or prior to the Petition Date, Buyer
shall deposit into an escrow account (the " _Good Faith Deposit Escrow_ ") at
Bank of America maintained by Lowenstein Sandler LLP, counsel to Sellers (the
" _Good Faith Deposit Escrow Holder_ "), an amount equal to thirty-three
million eight hundred thousand dollars $33,800,000 (the " _Good Faith
Deposit_ ") in immediately available funds. The Good Faith Deposit shall be
funded by Buyer pursuant to the Bidding Procedures. Following the execution
of this Agreement by the Parties, other than upon termination of this
Agreement by Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ , in which case, the Good
Faith Deposit shall be nonrefundable and paid to Sellers pursuant to the
terms of this _Section 2.3_ , the Good Faith Deposit shall be refunded to
Buyer upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason. At the Closing,
the Good Faith Deposit (and any interest or income accrued thereon) shall be
paid over to Sellers by the Good Faith Deposit Escrow Holder and, upon such
payment, the Good Faith Deposit shall be credited and applied toward
payment of the Purchase Price (but shall not reduce the amount of the Cash
Balance). In the event the Good Faith Deposit becomes nonrefundable as
provided herein before the Closing by reason of Sellers terminating this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ , the Good Faith Deposit Escrow Holder
shall immediately disburse the Good Faith Deposit and all interest or income
accrued thereon to Sellers to be retained by Sellers for their own account.
Sellers' retention of the Good Faith Deposit pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall constitute liquidated damages and shall be the exclusive
damages available to the Sellers in the event of any termination by Sellers
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ (except in the case of a Willful Breach of this
Agreement by Buyer, in which case Sellers' retention of the Good Faith
Deposit shall be in addition to any other remedies the Sellers may have under
_Section 8.5_ ). If this Agreement terminates in accordance with the
termination provisions hereof for any reason other than by Sellers pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)_ , the Good Faith Deposit Escrow Holder shall return to
Buyer, without prejudice to Buyer's right to receive the Break-Up Fee and
Expense Reimbursement, if any, when payable in accordance with _Section
7.3(a)_ , the Good Faith Deposit (together with all income or interest
accrued thereon), within three (3) Business Days after this Agreement is so
terminated. The Parties hereto agree that, prior to the earliest of (i)
application of the Good Faith Deposit against the payment of the Purchase
Price, (ii) the Good Faith Deposit becoming nonrefundable as provided herein
before the Closing by reason of Sellers terminating this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)_ or (iii) the return of the Good Faith Deposit to
Buyer under the provisions of this _Section 2.3_ , the Good Faith Deposit
shall be treated for federal, and applicable state and local, income Tax
purposes as owned by Buyer.

  



  

2.4 _Adjustment to Base Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing,
Parent shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth Parent's good faith
and reasonably detailed estimate of Net Current Assets (the " _Estimated Net
Current Assets_ "), Net Debt (" _Estimated Net Debt_ "), and the Cash Balance
based thereon (the " _Estimated Cash Balance_ ").

  



  

(b) Not later than forty-five (45) days following the Closing, Buyer
shall deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth Buyer's good faith and reasonably detailed calculation of Net Current
Assets, Net Debt and the Cash Balance based thereon. If the Cash Balance, as
finally determined by this _Section 2.4_ , is less than the Estimated Cash
Balance, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the absolute
value of such difference (the " _Shortfall_ "). If the Cash Balance, as
finally determined by this _Section 2.4_ , is greater than the Estimated Cash
Balance, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the absolute
value of such difference (the " _Surplus_ ").

  



    

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) The Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be payable in accordance with
the Closing Statement and _Section 2.4(d)_ no later than forty-five (45) days
after receipt by Parent of the Closing Statement (and Sellers and Buyer shall
instruct the Escrow Agent accordingly) unless and to the extent Parent
delivers a notice of disagreement in accordance with the following sentence,
setting forth the basis for such disagreement and Parent's calculation of Net
Current Assets, Net Debt and the Cash Balance based thereon. During the forty
five (45) day period referred to above, Buyer shall and shall cause the
Acquired Subsidiaries to provide Parent and its representatives reasonable
access to the relevant books, records, facilities and employees of the
Acquired Business and the Acquired Subsidiaries to evaluate the calculation
of Net Current Assets, Net Debt and the Cash Balance based thereon. In
the event of any such disagreement, Parent shall so notify Buyer in writing
prior to the end of the forty five (45) day period referred to above, and the
Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such
disagreement. If the Parties are unable to resolve their disagreement through
such consultation, the Parties shall refer the disagreement to the Accounting
Firm to review promptly the Closing Statement and the disputed items or
amounts. Promptly, but no later than twenty (20) days after acceptance of its
appointment, the Accounting Firm shall determine (it being understood that in
making such determination, the Accounting Firm shall be functioning as an
expert and not as an arbitrator), based solely on written submissions by Buyer
and Parent, and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute and
shall render a written report as to the resolution of those issues in dispute
and the resulting computation of Net Current Assets, Net Debt and the Cash
Balance based thereon, as the case may be, which shall be conclusive and
binding on the Parties. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm
(x) shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section 2.4_ and (y) may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
items claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such items
claimed by either Party or include in its computation any item not included
in the computation provided by either Party. The Party (either Buyer, on the
one hand, or Parent on behalf of Sellers, on the other hand) whose
determination of the amount of the Cash Balance was farthest from the final
determination of the Cash Balance by the Accounting Firm shall bear the fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm plus any out-of-pocket
expenses (including attorneys' and accountants' fees) of the Party whose
determination of the Cash Balance was closest to the final determination by
the Accounting Firm. If the determination of the Cash Balance by the
Accounting Firm is equidistant between the determinations of the parties, the
fees of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand,
and Sellers, on the other hand, and each of Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, shall bear the cost of their own out-of-
pocket expenses.

  



  

(d) Any Shortfall shall be satisfied solely from the Adjustment
Escrow Amount and the remainder, if any, of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount shall be promptly paid over to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately
available funds into the account(s) designated in writing by Parent (and
Sellers and Buyer shall instruct the Escrow Agent accordingly promptly upon
final resolution of such Shortfall in accordance with _Section 2.4(c)_ ).
Sellers shall have no liability for a Shortfall in excess of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount. Any Surplus shall be satisfied by payment of the amount of the
Surplus to Sellers from Buyer via wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account(s) designated in writing by Parent (and, in
such case, the full Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be promptly paid over to
Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds into the account(s)
designated in writing by Parent, and Sellers and Buyer shall instruct the
Escrow Agent accordingly promptly upon final resolution of such Surplus in
accordance with _Section 2.4(c)_ ). Buyer shall have no liability for a
Surplus in excess of the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

  



  

(e) The Base Purchase Price _less_ the Shortfall, if any, or plus
the Surplus, if any, shall be the " _Purchase Price_ ".

  



    

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within one hundred and twenty
(120) calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to Buyer an
allocation of the Purchase Price (and all other capitalized costs) as
determined for tax purposes, among the Purchased Assets. Such allocation
shall be made pursuant to Code Section 1060 and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law, as
appropriate). If, within thirty (30) calendar days of Buyer's receipt of
Parent's proposed allocation, Buyer does not deliver to Parent written notice
(a " _Buyer Allocation Objection Notice_ ") of any objections that it has to
such allocation, Parent's proposed allocation shall be final. If Buyer timely
delivers to Parent a Buyer Allocation Objection Notice, then Parent and Buyer
shall work together in good faith to resolve the disputed items. If Parent
and Buyer are unable to resolve all of the disputed items within thirty (30)
calendar days of Parent's receipt of the Buyer Allocation Objection Notice
(or such later date as Parent and Buyer may agree), then Parent and Buyer
shall refer the disputed items for resolution, consistent with the side
constraints set forth in E _xhibit A_ , to the Accounting Firm in accordance
with procedures analogous to those set forth in _Section 2.4(c)_.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.5_  to the contrary, in no event
will the allocation finalized pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ include any
allocations contrary to the restrictions set forth in _Exhibit A_. Sellers
and Buyer agree that the allocation determined under this _Section 2.5_ shall
be binding on all Parties, and that Sellers and Buyer will (and Buyer will
cause the Acquired Subsidiaries to) report, act and file Tax Returns
(including, but not limited to IRS Form 8594) in all respects and for all
purposes consistent with such allocation, except to the extent inconsistent
with applicable Law. Neither Sellers nor Buyer shall (and Buyer will not
permit an Acquired Subsidiary to) take any position (whether in audits, tax
returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such allocation unless
required to do so by applicable Law.

  



  

2.6 _Closing Date_. Upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of
Lowenstein Sandler LLP, 1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York

in accordance with this Agreement), or at such other place or time as Buyer
and Sellers may agree in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that without the

form, document or report publicly filed with or publicly furnished to the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries from and after July 1, 2015 and prior to the Agreement Date
(excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk factors," "forward-looking
statements" or "market risk" sections to the extent they are cautionary,
predictive or forward-looking in nature) (collectively, the " _Parent SEC
Disclosures_ "), (b) as disclosed in any Bankruptcy Court filings by Sellers
or any of their respective Subsidiaries made prior to the Agreement Date (the
" _Bankruptcy Court Filings_ "), or (c) as disclosed in the disclosure
schedule delivered by Sellers to Buyer concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement (the " _Sellers Disclosure Schedule_ "), each Seller,
jointly and severally, represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

  



  

3.1 _Organization_. Such Seller is a legal entity duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of New
York. Subject to the limitations imposed on such Seller as a result of having
filed a petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, such Seller has full
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted in the Acquired Business, except
where the failure to have such power or authority would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

3.2 _Acquired Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(a) _Section 3.2_ of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
name of each Acquired Subsidiary, and, with respect to each such entity, the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized, the jurisdictions, if
any, in which it is qualified to do business, the names of all shareholders
or other equity owners and the number of shares of stock owned by each such
shareholder or the amount of equity owned by each such equity owner. Each
Acquired Subsidiary is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and
(where such concept is recognized) in good standing under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted. Each Acquired
Subsidiary (other than the Joint Venture) is duly qualified or licensed, and
has all necessary governmental approvals, to do business and is in good
standing (where such concept is recognized) in each jurisdiction in which the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such approvals, qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so duly approved, qualified or licensed and in
good standing (where such concept is recognized) would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

equity interests are owned by the applicable holder free and clear of any and
all Liens (other than Permitted Liens and Liens created by Buyer). There is no
existing option, warrant, call, right or Contract to which any Acquired
Subsidiary (other than the Joint Venture) is a party requiring, and there are
no convertible securities of any Acquired Subsidiary (other than the Joint
Venture) outstanding which upon conversion would require, the issuance of any
shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any Acquired Subsidiary
(other than the Joint Venture) or other securities convertible into shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of any Acquired Subsidiary (other than
the Joint Venture).

Alternative Bids (if any), the entry of the Sale Order and such other
authorization as is required by the Bankruptcy Code, the legal, valid and
binding agreements of such Seller, enforceable against such Seller in

assume and perform the Assumed Liabilities or for Buyer to consummate on a
timely basis the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

the amount of all contingent Liabilities) and Indebtedness as it becomes
absolute or matured, and (c) the assets of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, at a fair valuation, will exceed their Liabilities (including the

contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements, obligations or
understandings, whether written or oral, between Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of Sellers' management
or Sellers' boards of directors, on the other hand, relating in any way to
Sellers (including with respect to the management or control of Sellers), the
transactions contemplated hereby or to the operations of Parent (solely
related to the Acquired Business), NY Agri and the Acquired Subsidiaries
after the Closing. Buyer does not hold, directly or indirectly, any beneficial
or other ownership interest in any of Sellers or their Subsidiaries or any of
their respective securities.

  



  

4.9 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
New Mountain Partners V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "
_Guarantor_ "), has delivered to Sellers a duly executed limited guarantee
pursuant to which the Guarantor has guaranteed certain obligations under this
Agreement (the " _Guarantee_ "). The Guarantee is in full force and effect,
has not been amended or modified and is a legal and valid and binding
obligation of the Guarantor. No event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach or
failure to satisfy a conditions under the terms and conditions of the
Guarantee on the part of the Guarantor under the Guarantee.

  



  

4.10 _Investment Intention_. Buyer is acquiring the capital stock of
the Acquired Subsidiaries for its own account, for investment purposes
only and not with a view to the distribution (as such term is used in Section
2(a)(11) of the Securities Act). Buyer understands that the capital stock of
the Acquired Subsidiaries may not have been registered under the Securities
Act and may not be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities
Act or an exemption from such registration is available

Acquired Subsidiary or (ii) conflict with any Law applicable to a Seller or
any Acquired Subsidiary or the assets or operation of the Acquired Business;
_provided_  that in such instances, Sellers shall inform Buyer of the general
nature of the information being withheld and, upon Buyer's request,
reasonably cooperate with the other party to provide such information, in
whole or in part, in a manner that would not result in any of the outcomes
described in the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to
them or their respective Representatives in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall

Permitted Access Parties furnish Buyer with reasonably detailed written
descriptions of the materials to be so copied and applicable Permitted Access
Party reimburses Buyer for the reasonable costs and expenses thereof;
_provided, however_ , that the foregoing rights of access shall not be
exercisable in such a manner as to interfere with the normal operations of
Buyer's business. Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 5.2_
 to the contrary, in no event shall a Seller have access to any information
that, based on advice of Buyer's counsel, could (i) reasonably be expected to
create liability under applicable Law, or waive any legal privilege, (ii)
result in the discharge of any Trade Secrets of Buyer, its affiliates or any
third parties or (iii) violate any obligation of Buyer with respect

5.3 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) _Transferred Employees_. No later than fifteen (15) Business

Business as of the date hereof (the " _Business Employees_ ") and who remain
employed by Sellers or such Acquired Subsidiary immediately prior to the

on _Section 5.3(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, with Comparable
Positions and Comparable Compensation and Benefits. Those employees who

cooperate with the Buyer Group (i) to ensure that offer letters described in
this _Section 5.3(a)_ are timely distributed to each applicable Business
Employee and (ii) to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, to provide a
copy of any Seller Benefit Plan to Buyer to enable Buyer to satisfy its
obligations under this _Section 5.3(a)_.

  



    

 | 27| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Business Employees_. _Section 5.3(b)_ of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule sets out a complete and accurate list of all Business
Employees, including, for each employee: (i) name (or to the extent not
permitted by applicable Law, employee identification number); (ii) job title;
(iii) hire date; (iv) work location; (v) current annual base compensation;
(vi) commission, target bonus or other incentive-based compensation; (vii)
leave status (including estimated return date), and (viii) visa or other work
permit status (if applicable).

  



  

(c) _Credit under Buyer Benefit Plans_. Buyer will take
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause any employee benefit plans of
Buyer (or any Affiliate thereof sponsoring or maintaining such plans) in
which the Transferred Employees are eligible to participate following the
Closing Date (the " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") to take into account for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and accrual of and entitlement to benefits (but not
for accrual of benefits under any "defined benefit plan," as defined in
Section 3(35) of ERISA), and all other purposes, all service by the
Transferred Employees with Sellers prior to the Closing as if such service
were with Buyer or its Affiliates, to the same extent such service was
credited under a comparable Seller Benefit Plan prior to the Closing (except
to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits). In addition,
with respect to each Buyer Benefit Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate
of Buyer sponsoring or maintaining such Buyer Benefit Plan, to take
commercially reasonable best efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any pre-
existing condition exclusions, actively at work requirements, insurability
requirements or other eligibility limitations to the extent such exclusions,
requirements or limitations were waived or were inapplicable under a
comparable Seller Benefit Plan prior to the Closing, and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-
pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to, the Transferred Employees and their dependents under a
comparable Seller Benefit Plan prior to the Closing. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for complying with the requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code for any employee of any Seller
who is an "MandA qualified beneficiary" as defined in QandA-4 of Treas. Reg.
§54.4980B-9 in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(d) _Employment Tax Reporting_. With respect to Transferred
Employees, Buyer and Sellers shall use the alternate procedure set forth in
Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-34 I.R.B. 320, provided that Sellers provide
to Buyer all information necessary for Buyer to complete such alternate
procedure and that third party payroll provider agrees it can accommodate
utilization of the alternate procedure to properly report and remit federal
and state payroll.

  



  

(e) _No Obligation_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed to require the employment of (or prevent the termination of
employment of) any individual, require minimum benefit levels or prevent any
change in the employee benefits provided to any individual Transferred
Employee. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee of a Seller or any
Acquired Subsidiary or any other Person (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) of any nature or kind whatsoever, including in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) for any specified
period. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall (i) be construed
to establish, amend or modify any Seller Benefit Plan or other benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) alter or limit the ability of
Sellers, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify, or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. Nothing in this
_Section 5.3_ is intended to interfere with Buyer's right from and after the
Closing to terminate the employment of, or change the compensation and
benefits available to, any Transferred Employee.

  



    

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans_. To the extent that
any Transferred Employee has an accrued benefit as of the Closing Date in
the nonqualified deferred compensation plans of Sellers (each, a " _NQ Plan_
"), Sellers shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, split such NQ Plans
into one or more separate plans that contains only the accrued benefits for
Transferred Employees. Buyer and Sellers intend and agree in accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(4) that the transfer of employment of
the Transferred Employees from Sellers (or their respective Affiliates) to
Buyer (or its Affiliates) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (and the related termination of employment of the Transferred
Employees from Sellers) shall not constitute a "separation from service" for
purposes of Code Section 409A and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. If
Seller maintains a "rabbi trust" with respect to a NQ Plan (each an "
_Existing NQ Trust_ "), to the extent transferred pursuant to _Section
1.1(o)_ , Seller shall establish a new rabbi trust (each a " _New NQ Trust_
") and cause the assets of the Existing NQ Trust, to the extent earmarked for
the benefit of a Transferred Employee who has an accrued benefit as of the
Closing Date in the NQ Plan, to be transferred to the New NQ Trust, which New
NQ Trust shall be assumed by Buyer.

  



  

5.4 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to
consummate the Asset Purchase as promptly as practicable, including (i)
preparing and filing all forms, registrations and notifications with any
Governmental Entities or third parties required to be filed to consummate the
Asset Purchase, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions
to consummating the Asset Purchase, (iii) using reasonable best efforts to
obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent,
authorization, expiration or termination of a waiting period, permit, Order
or approval of, waiver or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity (including
furnishing all information and documentary material required under the HSR
Act) required to be obtained or made by Buyer, Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates in connection with the Asset Purchase or the taking of
any action contemplated hereby, (iv) defending any lawsuits or other
legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Asset Purchase, and (v) using reasonable
best efforts with respect to the execution and delivery of all such
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and do all other things
reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Asset Purchase and to
fully carry out the purposes or intent of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall
each keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the
consummation of the Closing and work cooperatively in connection with
obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or
any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 5.4_. In that regard, prior to the Closing, each
party shall promptly consult with the other parties to this Agreement with
respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance as the other
parties may reasonably request with respect to (and, in the case of
correspondence, provide the other parties (or their counsel and, if
reasonably determined necessary, advisable or convenient to protect attorney-
client privilege or competitively sensitive information, outside counsel only
basis) with copies of) all notices, submissions or filings made by or on
behalf of such party or any of its Affiliates with any Governmental Entity or
any other information supplied by or on behalf of such party or any of its
Affiliates to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the Asset Purchase. Each party to this Agreement
shall promptly inform the other parties to this Agreement, and if in
writing, furnish the other parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other parties orally of) any communication from or
to any Governmental Entity regarding the Asset Purchase, and permit the other
parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed communication or
submission with any such Governmental Entity. No party or any of its
Affiliates shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Asset Purchase
unless it consults with the other parties in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer and Sellers may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this _Section 5.4(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel

obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Buyer or Sellers, as
the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 5.4_ , materials provided pursuant to

(c) Sellers and Buyer shall make or file, as promptly as
practicable, with the appropriate Governmental Entity all filings, forms,
registrations and notifications required to be filed to consummate the
purchase of the Purchased Assets under the HSR Act and any other
applicable Antitrust Law, and subsequent to such filings, Sellers and Buyer
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, as promptly as
practicable, respond to inquiries from Governmental Entities, or provide any
supplemental information that may be requested by Governmental Entities, in
connection with filings made with such Governmental Entities. Sellers and
Buyer shall file their notification and report forms under the HSR Act no
later than ten (10) Business Days after the Agreement Date. In the event that
the parties receive a request for information or documentary material
pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_ "), the parties will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to submit an appropriate response to, and to
certify substantial compliance with, such Second Request as promptly as
reasonably practicable, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate
during the entirety of any such Second Request review process.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer shall, in order to permit the satisfaction of the HSR Act and
_Section 5.4(b)_ so as to permit the Closing to occur as promptly as
practicable and in any event before the End Date (i) propose,
negotiate, commit to, effect and agree to, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, and
other disposition of and restriction on the businesses, assets, properties,
product lines, and equity interests of, or changes to the conduct of business
of, the Acquired Business and Sellers, Buyer and their respective Affiliates
(including, with respect to Sellers and the Acquired Subsidiaries), and (ii)
create, terminate, or divest relationships, ventures, contractual rights
or obligations of Buyer or its Affiliates or, solely in respect of the
Acquired Business, Sellers, the Acquired Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates,. If requested by Buyer, Sellers will agree to any action
contemplated by this _Section 5.4_ ; _provided_  that any such agreement or
action is conditioned on the consummation of the Asset Purchase. Without
limiting the foregoing, in no event will a Seller (and such Seller will not
permit any of its Affiliates to) propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any
such actions without the prior written consent of Buyer, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this _Section 5.4_ , if any administrative or judicial
action or Proceeding, including any Proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Asset Purchase or
any other transaction contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law,
Sellers and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any
such action or Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Asset Purchase.

  



    

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, Buyer shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, knowingly take
any action, or knowingly refrain from taking any action, the effect of which
would be to delay or impede the ability of the parties hereto to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to,
acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing
a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner,
any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be
expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of
not obtaining, any consent, approval, authorization, declaration, waiver,
license, franchise, permit, certificate or order of any Governmental Entity
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of
any Governmental Entity entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(g) The fees and expenses for all filings under the HSR Act and any
other necessary filings or submissions to any Governmental Entity pursuant to
this _Section 5.4_ shall be borne in full by Buyer as and when due.

  



  

5.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Except for litigations or
other Proceedings commenced, filed or pending in the Bankruptcy Court, each
Party shall promptly (and in any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify
the other Parties in writing of any litigation or other Proceeding brought or
threatened in writing against it or its directors or executive officers or
other Representatives relating to this Agreement, the Asset Purchase and/or
the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall keep the other Parties
informed on a reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof
(including by promptly furnishing to the other Parties and their respective
Representatives such information relating to such litigation or other
Proceeding as may be reasonably requested). Each Party shall, subject to the
preservation of the attorney-client and similar privileges and confidential
information, give the other Parties the opportunity to participate in (but
not control) the defense or settlement of any litigation or other Proceeding
against it and/or its directors or executive officers or other
Representatives relating to this Agreement, the Asset Purchase or the
other transactions contemplated hereby and shall give due consideration to
such other Parties' advice with respect to such litigation or other
Proceeding.

  



  

5.6 _Adequate Assurances regarding the Buyer Assumed Agreements_.
With respect to each Buyer Assumed Agreement, Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide adequate assurance as required
under the Bankruptcy Code of the future performance by Buyer of each such
Buyer Assumed Agreement. Sellers and Buyer agree that they will promptly take
all actions reasonably required to assist in obtaining a Bankruptcy Court
finding that there has been an adequate demonstration of adequate assurance of
future performance under the Buyer Assumed Agreements, such as furnishing
affidavits, non-confidential financial information or other documents
or information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court and making Sellers' and
Buyer's employees and representatives available to testify before the
Bankruptcy Court.

  



  

5.7 _Bankruptcy Court Approval_.

  



  

(a) Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that this Agreement and the sale
of the Purchased Assets are subject to Bankruptcy Court approval and
the consideration by Sellers of Alternative Bids (if any). Sellers and Buyer
acknowledge that (i) to obtain such approval, Sellers must demonstrate that
they have taken reasonable steps to obtain the highest or otherwise best offer
possible for the Purchased Assets, including giving notice of the
transactions contemplated hereby to creditors and certain other interested
parties as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, and conducting an auction in
respect of the Purchased Assets pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order (the
" _Auction_ "), and (ii) Buyer must provide adequate assurance of future
performance under the Buyer Assumed Agreements.

  



    

 | 31| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) As soon as reasonably possible after the Parties execute this
Agreement, but in any event no later than February 25, 2019, Sellers shall
file the Sale Motion with the Bankruptcy Court, together with required
supporting papers and required notices.

  



  

5.8 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) Without the prior written consent of Sellers, Buyer shall not
make any election under Section 336 or 338 of the Code for or with respect to
any Acquired Subsidiary in connection with the transactions provided for
herein. The provisions of this _Section 5.8(a)_  shall expressly survive
Closing or any earlier termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the other terms set forth in this Agreement,
any sales Tax, use Tax, real property transfer, real property records
recordation fees, documentary or stamp Tax, excise Tax or similar non-income
Tax attributable to the sale or transfer of the Purchased Assets and not
exempted under the Sale Order (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by Buyer.
Buyer shall, at its own expense, file any necessary Tax Returns relating to
Transfer Taxes and other documentation with respect to any Transfer Taxes, and
Sellers will provide such cooperation as Buyer shall reasonably request in
connection with such filings, provided that Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for
any reasonable and out of pocket expenses Sellers incur in connection with
such cooperation. For the avoidance of doubt, any China Enterprise Income Tax
(" _EIT_ ") imposed on any capital gain in connection with a transfer of the
Aceto (Shanghai) Ltd. shares (" _Applicable EIT_ ") shall not be a Transfer
Tax and shall not be borne by Buyer and shall be borne by Sellers. Buyer is
entitled to withhold any amounts required to be withheld in respect of the
Applicable EIT from amounts payable to Sellers pursuant to this Agreement and
Sellers agree to provide any information reasonably requested by Buyer and
such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in order to permit
the calculation of such Tax, and the making of required withholding and
filings and other compliance with requirements of applicable Law. Any amounts
withheld by Buyer in respect of Applicable EIT in excess of the amounts
required to be paid in respect of Applicable EIT shall be paid to Sellers
reasonably promptly following the determination that there is such an excess
amount. Any refunds received by Buyer or any Acquired Subsidiary of any
Applicable EIT imposed in connection with the transactions provided for
herein paid with funds received or withheld from Sellers shall be paid by
Buyer to Sellers reasonably promptly following such receipt. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any EIT imposed on any capital
gain in connection with a direct or indirect transfer of the shares of Aceto
HK (including indirect transfer of the real property owned by Aceto HK in
China) shall be treated as a Transfer Tax for all purposes of this
Agreement and borne by Buyer Any Tax, termination fee or similar payment
attributable to an early termination of the "PILOT" ("payment in lieu of
taxes") program of the Nassau County Industrial Development Agency (" _NCIDA_
") applicable or otherwise relating to the Port Washington, NY property as to
which Aceto Realty is the tenant pursuant to a sale leaseback arrangement
with the NCIDA resulting from the transactions provided for herein shall be
treated as a "Transfer Tax" for all purposes of this Agreement. The
provisions of this _Section 5.8(b)_ shall expressly survive Closing.

  



  

(c) Tax Liabilities for a period that includes but does not end on
the Closing Date shall be treated for purposes of determining the
amount attributable to the portion of such period that ends on the Closing
Date as follows: (i) in the case of any sales, use, value-added, employment,
or withholding Tax, any Tax based on or measured by income, profits, gains,
receipts or the level of any item or on a transactional basis shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the end of the day
on the Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions), other than with respect to property placed in
service after the Closing, shall be allocated on a per diem basis,
unless otherwise required by applicable law, and (ii) in the case of all
other Taxes, shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period;
provided that for these purposes any event occurring on the Closing Date
following the Adjustment Time shall be treated as occurring on the day
after the Closing Date to the extent such event is not provided for in this
Agreement except that events on the Closing Date following the Adjustment
Time but before the Closing that are not in the Ordinary Course of Business
shall be treated as occurring on the day before the Closing Date.

  



    

 | 32| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) It is intended by Sellers that, prior to Closing, NY Agri will
merge into a newly formed Delaware corporation, with such
Delaware corporation surviving, in a transaction intended to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and that such surviving
Delaware corporation will, following such merger, convert to a limited
liability company under the Delaware conversion statute. The Parties agree
that nothing in this Agreement, including _Section 5.1_ , shall prevent such
merger or conversion or impose any Liability upon any Seller as a result of
such conversion.

  



  

5.9 _Public Announcements_. Neither Sellers, on the one hand, nor
Buyer, on the other hand, shall, without the approval of the other
Parties, make any press release or other public announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby, except as and to the extent that any such
Party shall be so obligated by Law, including as may be required by the
Bankruptcy Case, securities laws, or the rules of any stock exchange, in
which case, each Party shall be advised prior to such disclosure, consult with
each other before issuing such press release or public announcement and
consider in good faith any comments received from the other Party at
least two (2) Business Days prior to such issuance. The provisions of this
_Section 5.9_ shall expressly survive Closing or any earlier termination of
this Agreement.

  



  

5.10 _Consents; Notices_. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents and give all
notices required for Sellers to assign the Buyer Assumed Agreements to which
they are a party to Buyer to the extent not assignable without any such
approval, consent, or notice pursuant to Section 363 or Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code. If any Consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, then,
subject to Sellers having appropriate levels of resources and personnel,
Sellers, at the sole cost of Buyer, shall continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts after the Closing to obtain the Consents and, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, will establish an agency type or other similar
arrangement reasonably satisfactory to Sellers and Buyer under which Buyer
would obtain, to the extent practicable, all rights under the Buyer Assumed
Agreements and assume the corresponding Assumed Liabilities for the period of
time that the Consents are not obtained and the Buyer Assumed Agreements are
not assigned. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree and acknowledge
that (a) the failure by Sellers to obtain any Consents shall not relieve any
party of its obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
(b) there will not be any adjustment to the Purchase Price if any Consents
are not obtained or certain Buyer Assumed Agreements are not assigned, and (c)
Buyer shall not have any claim against Sellers after the Closing in respect
of any such Consents not being obtained or Buyer Assumed Agreements not being
assigned.

  



  

5.11 _WARN Act_. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Acquired Subsidiaries
to, provide any required notice under and to otherwise comply with, the WARN
Act with respect to any event affecting the Transferred Employees on or after
the Closing Date. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in determining whether
any event affecting the Transferred Employees on or after the Closing Date
requires notification under the WARN Act. Buyer shall not, and shall cause
the Acquired Subsidiaries not to, take any action on or after the
Closing that would cause Seller or any of its Affiliates to incur liability
under the WARN Act.

  



    

 | 33| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5.12 _Directors and Officers_. After the Closing, Buyer shall cause
the Acquired Subsidiaries to, honor all the Acquired
Subsidiaries' obligations to, exculpate, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
(including advancing funds for expenses), to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the current and former directors and officers of the Acquired
Subsidiaries, and any employee of the Acquired Subsidiaries who acts as a
fiduciary under any employee benefit plan, in each case, solely with respect
to acts or omissions by such persons occurring at or before the Closing and
solely with respect to acts or omissions by such persons in their capacity as
a director, officer or employee of the Acquired Subsidiaries (and not with
respect to any other position with Sellers), and such obligations shall
survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with the terms of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or similar
organizational documents) of the Acquired Subsidiaries and any individual
indemnity agreements or other applicable documents from the Closing until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to
any claims against such persons arising from, relating to, or otherwise in
respect of, such acts or omissions. After the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
Acquired Subsidiaries to maintain in effect substantially similar exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the certificates of
incorporation and by-laws or similar organizational documents of the Acquired
Subsidiaries and any indemnification agreements of the Acquired Subsidiaries
with any of their respective directors, officers or employees, in each case
as in effect as of the date hereof, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provisions in any manner that would materially adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individuals with respect to such periods
on or prior to the Closing Date who at the time of the Closing were current
or former directors, officers or employees of the Acquired Subsidiaries. If
Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all its properties and assets, then, and in each case, Buyer
shall ensure that such surviving corporation or entity or the transferees of
such properties or assets assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.12_.

  



  

5.13 _Cooperation with Financing_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, and shall cause the Acquired Subsidiaries to use
their commercially reasonable efforts to, provide to Buyer, at Buyer's sole
cost and expense, such cooperation as is reasonably requested by Buyer, or as
otherwise reasonably necessary, in connection with the arrangement and
consummation of any debt financing to be incurred by Buyer on the Closing
Date to finance the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder
(the " _Debt Financing_ ") ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Sellers or the Acquired
Subsidiaries), including (i) providing prior to the Closing Date (a) the
Financial Statements and (b) an unaudited balance sheet of the Acquired
Business as of December 31, 2018 and, if the Closing has not occurred on or
before May 1, 2019, to the extent such financials would otherwise be produced
prior to the Closing in the ordinary course of business, March 31, 2019, and
the related income statement and statement of cash flows for the six (6)-month
period ended December 31, 2018 and, if the Closing has not occurred on or
before May 1, 2019, to the extent such financials would otherwise be produced

(9)-month period ended March 31, 2019 (all such statements and
information referred to in this clause (i), the " _Required Information_ ");
(ii) assist with obtaining customary legal opinions, appraisals, surveys,
title insurance, insurance certificates and endorsements, waivers,
environmental reports and other customary documentation and items
contemplated by the Debt Financing as reasonably requested by Buyer; (iii)

collateral, guarantees, mortgages or other certificate or documents as may
reasonably be requested by Buyer, in each case effective on or after the
Closing, including obtaining releases of existing liens; (iv) furnish no
later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing all documentation and
other information required by a Governmental Entity under applicable "know
your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001, but in each case, solely as relating to the
Acquired Subsidiaries to the extent requested at least nine (9) days prior to
the Closing; and (v) assist in the preparation, execution and delivery of one
or more credit agreements, pledge and security documents and other definitive
financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer. The Sellers
hereby consent to the reasonable use of all of its and the Acquired
Subsidiaries' logos, names, and trademarks in connection with the Debt
Financing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such logos, names and trademarks
are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage the Sellers or the reputation or goodwill of the Sellers or
any of their respective products, services, offerings or intellectual
property rights; _provided_ , _further_ , that prior to the Closing Date no
financing sources in connection with the Debt Financing (including any
Affiliates thereof) shall obtain rights in such logos, names or trademarks.
Sellers shall, and shall cause the Acquired Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to promptly supplement the Required Information and all other
information provided pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ to the extent that any
such Required Information and all other information, to the knowledge of
Sellers, when taken as a whole, contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
made in such Required Information, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not materially misleading. Buyer shall keep Sellers
informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and promptly upon request provide to
Sellers copies (including drafts) of any definitive debt financing agreement
and any other material documents relating to the Debt Financing. No
obligations of Sellers, the Acquired Subsidiaries or any of their Subsidiaries
or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives under any
definitive debt financing agreement executed pursuant to this _Section 5.13_
shall be required to be effective until the Closing. In addition,
notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.13_ to the contrary, in fulfilling
its obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ , none of Sellers, their
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives
shall be required to (i) pay any commitment or other fee, provide any
security or incur any Liability or obligation in connection with the Debt
Financing or any other financing, (ii) take or permit the taking of any action
that would reasonably be expected to conflict with, result in any violation
or breach of, or default (with or without lapse of time, or both) under, the
Organizational Documents of Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries, or any
applicable Law or material contracts of Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries,
(iii) pass resolutions or consents or approve or authorize the execution of
the Debt Financing or any definitive debt financing agreements, (iv) provide
any cooperation that would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations
of the Acquired Business or (v) disclose any information which is legally
privileged. Buyer acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection with the Debt Financing is subject to the terms of _Section 5.9_
and the Confidentiality Agreement, and none of Sellers or any of
Sellers' Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall have any liability to Buyer or any
other Person in respect of any financial statements, other financial
information or data or other information provided pursuant to this _Section
5.13_.

(b) Buyer shall, following request by Sellers, immediately reimburse
Sellers for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses incurred by Sellers and their Subsidiaries in cooperating with the
Debt Financing (including reasonable attorneys' fees). Buyer shall indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless the Sellers and the Acquired Subsidiaries (and their
respective Representatives) from and against any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs and expenses suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the Debt Financing or any other financing (including the
arrangement thereof) and its assistance to Buyer in connection with the Debt
Financing or any other financing (including the arrangement thereof) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than any liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses resulting from any Required
Information or other financial statements provided pursuant to this _Section
5.13_ by the Sellers or the Acquired Subsidiaries to Buyer).

  



  

(c) With respect to information disclosed to any rating agency (the
" _Confidential Rating Agency Information_ "), Buyer shall (i) inform such
rating agency of the confidential nature of the Confidential Rating Agency
Information and mark any such information provided in writing to such rating
agency as "confidential" and (ii) require such rating agency not to disclose
the Confidential Rating Agency Information to any third party or to
specifically exclude such information in such ratings agency's ratings
report. Buyer shall be responsible for any breach of this covenant by any such
rating agency. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including the Debt Financing) by or to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any
other financing transaction be a condition to any of Buyer's obligations
hereunder.

transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" form, or by
any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and

8.4 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether at
Law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York.

including the resolution of any and all disputes hereunder, shall be heard

8.5 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree and acknowledge that if any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy
at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and
accordingly (i) each of the Parties shall be entitled to, and may seek in the
alternative, such remedies as are available at law and in equity, and (ii)
(A) except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.5(b)_ and _Section 8.5(c)_ ,
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof, in each case, in the Bankruptcy Court (as set forth in
_Section 8.4(b)_ ), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, (B) the Parties waive any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any
specific performance or injunctive relief and (C) the Parties agree, in
any action for specific performance, that there is no adequate remedy at law.
In circumstances where Buyer is obligated to consummate the Asset Purchase
and the Asset Purchase has not been consummated, Buyer expressly acknowledges
and agrees that Sellers shall have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary
damages will be inadequate to compensate Sellers, and that Sellers shall be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to them
whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to enforce specifically
Buyer's obligations to consummate the Asset Purchase. Sellers' pursuit of
specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies
or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which Sellers
may be entitled. In no event shall the Parties be entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance of the consummation of the Asset Purchase
pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ and monetary damages to which it is entitled
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to termination of this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Parties shall be entitled to seek the remedies
provided herein in the alternative, and not be required to elect their
remedies, in any Proceeding brought to seek redress for the failure of Buyer
to consummate the Asset Purchase pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event of any breach prior to the Closing by Sellers of
any of Sellers' agreements, representations, or warranties contained herein
or in the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale Order, including any Willful
Breach, Buyer's sole and exclusive remedies shall be (i) to exercise Buyer's
rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE VII,_ in accordance
with the terms of such _ARTICLE VII,_ (ii) the return of the Good Faith
Deposit as provided in _Section 2.3_ , and (iii) to the Break-Up Fee or the
Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, if earned in accordance with _Section
7.3_ , and Buyer shall not have any further cause of action for damages,
specific performance, or any other legal or equitable relief against Sellers
with respect thereto.

  



  

(c) In the event of any breach prior to the Closing by Buyer of any
of Buyer's agreements, representations, or warranties contained herein,
including any Willful Breach, Sellers' sole and exclusive remedies shall be
(i) to exercise Sellers' rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_ARTICLE VII_ , in accordance with the terms of such _ARTICLE VII_ , (ii) the
payment of the Good Faith Deposit as provided in _Section 2.3_ , and (iii) to
enforce any provision of this Agreement pursuant to clause (ii) of _Section
8.5(a)_ and the two sentences that immediately follow such clause (and, in the
case of a Willful Breach of this Agreement by Buyer, to enforce any provision
of this Agreement pursuant to any provision of _Section 8.5(a)_ ).

(c) _Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters_. Unless otherwise
expressly provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of
interpretation shall apply:

  



  

(i) _Calculation of Time Period_. When calculating the period of
time before which, within which or following which any act is to be done
or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date
in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period
is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding
Business Day.

  



  

(ii) _Dollars_. Any reference in this Agreement to $ shall mean U.S.
dollars.

  



  

(iii) _Exhibits/Schedules_. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto
or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Any capitalized terms used in any
Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set
forth in this Agreement.

  



  

8.17 _Sellers Disclosure Schedule_. The Sellers Disclosure Schedule is
qualified in its entirety by reference to specific provisions of
this Agreement and is not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed
as constituting, representations, warranties and covenants of Sellers, except
as and to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement. Each section or
subsection referenced in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule corresponds to the
section or subsection set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any matter set forth in any section or subsection of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be referred to and incorporated in all
other sections or subsections of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule to which the
relevance of such matter is reasonably apparent on its face to inform Buyer
that such information is relevant to such other section or subsection. The
inclusion of any information or reference in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to be an admission, acknowledgment or representation, in
and of itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be
disclosed, is material, has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect, is outside
the Ordinary Course of Business or defines further the meaning of such terms
for purposes of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement or in the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule constitutes an admission (i) to any third party of any
liability or obligation of Sellers to any third-party or (ii) that any
information disclosed, set forth or incorporated by reference in the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule or in this Agreement is material or has (or may result in)
a Material Adverse Effect.

be limited as follows:

  



  

(a) The Good Faith Deposit Escrow Holder shall not be responsible
for or be required to enforce any of the terms or conditions of
this Agreement or any other agreement between Sellers and Buyer. The Good
Faith Deposit Escrow Holder shall not be responsible or liable in any manner

their respective obligations under this Agreement, nor shall the Good Faith
Deposit Escrow Holder be responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for
the failure of the other parties to this Agreement or of any third party to
honor any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  



    

 | 56| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The duties and obligations of the Good Faith Deposit Escrow

willful misconduct.

  



  

(e) The Good Faith Deposit Escrow Holder shall be entitled to
consult with counsel of its own selection and the opinion of such
counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Good
Faith Deposit Escrow Holder in respect of any action taken or omitted by the

with the opinion of such counsel.

  



  

(f) The Good Faith Deposit Escrow Holder shall have the right at any
time to resign for any reason and be discharged of its duties as Good Faith
Deposit Escrow Holder hereunder by giving written notice of its resignation to
the parties hereto prior to the date specified for such resignation to take
effect. All obligations of the Good Faith Deposit Escrow Holder hereunder
shall cease and terminate on the effective date of its resignation and its
sole responsibility thereafter shall be to hold the Good Faith Deposit, for
a period of no more than thirty (30) calendar days following the effective
date of resignation, at which time:

  



  

(i) if a successor holder of the Good Faith Deposit shall have been
appointed, by the mutual consent of Buyer and the Sellers, and written notice
thereof shall have been given to the resigning Good Faith Deposit Escrow
Holder by the parties hereto and such successor holder, then the resigning
Good Faith Deposit Escrow Holder shall deliver the Good Faith Deposit to such
successor holder; or

  



  

(ii) if a successor holder of the Good Faith Deposit shall not have

hold the Good Faith Deposit Holder harmless from and against any and all
liabilities, causes of action, claims, demands, judgments, damages, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) that may arise

performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement. The Good
Faith Deposit Holder shall be under no duty to institute any suit, or to take
any remedial procedures under this Agreement, or to enter any appearance or in
any way defend any suit in which it may be made a defendant hereunder until
it shall be indemnified as provided above.

  



  

(h) If the Good Faith Deposit Holder shall be uncertain as to its
duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions with respect to the
Good Faith Deposit which, in its sole discretion, are in conflict either with
other instructions received by it or with any provision of this Agreement,
the Good Faith Deposit Holder shall have the absolute right to suspend all
further performance under this Agreement (except for the safekeeping of the
Good Faith Deposit) until such uncertainty or conflicting instructions have
been resolved to the Good Faith Deposit Holder's sole satisfaction by final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, joint written instructions
from all of the other parties hereto, or otherwise.

  



  

(i) The parties acknowledge that Lowenstein Sandler LLP, as Good
Faith Deposit Holder, has agreed to serve in such capacity as an
accommodation to the parties on the condition that it be allowed to continue
to act as legal counsel to Sellers. Buyer acknowledges that

FORM OF BIDDING PROCEDURES

  



  

BIDDING PROCEDURES

  



  

Set forth below are the bidding procedures (the " _Bidding Procedures_ ") to
be used by Aceto Corporation, Aceto Agricultural Chemicals Corporation and
Aceto Realty LLC (together, the " _Sellers_ " and each a " _Seller_ ") for
the proposed sale of substantially all assets (as defined in the Stalking
Horse Agreement, the "Purchased Assets") comprising the Debtors'
Chemical Plus Business and assumption of certain related liabilities, in the
Sellers' jointly administered chapter 11 cases pending in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey (the " _Bankruptcy Court_ "),
case number 19-[______ (__)], pursuant to that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement, dated as of [●], 2019 (together with the schedules thereto
and related documents, and as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the " _Stalking Horse Agreement_ "), by and among
the Sellers and [●] (the " _Buyer_ " or " _Stalking Horse Bidder_ ").

  



  

The Buyer has submitted a Qualified Bid (as defined below) for the Purchased
Assets pursuant to the terms of the Stalking Horse Agreement (the " _Stalking
Horse Bid_ ").

  



  

On [●], 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, which, among other
things, authorized the Sellers to determine the highest or otherwise best
offer for the Purchased Assets through the Bidding Procedures (the " _Bidding
Procedures Order_ ").

  



  

The sale transaction pursuant to the Stalking Horse Agreement is subject to
competitive bidding as set forth herein.

  



   | A.| ASSETS TO BE SOLD 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Sellers seek to complete the sale of the Purchased Assets and the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities described in the Stalking Horse
Agreement.

  



  

Except as otherwise provided in the Stalking Horse Agreement or such other
approved purchase agreement of the Successful Bidder (as defined below), all
of each Seller's respective right, title and interest in and to the Purchased
Assets to be acquired shall be sold free and clear of all Liens, Claims and
other Liabilities (each as defined in the Stalking Horse Agreement), except
for Permitted Liens and Assumed Liabilities (each as defined in the Stalking
Horse Agreement) as may be specified in the Stalking Horse Agreement, and with
any such Liens, Claims and other Liabilities to attach solely to the net
proceeds of the sale of each applicable Purchased Asset.

  



  

A party may participate in the bidding process by submitting a Qualified Bid
for any or all of the Purchased Assets.

  



   | B.| THE BIDding PROCEDURES 
---|---|--- 
  



  

To ensure that the Sellers receive the maximum value for the Purchased
Assets, the Stalking Horse Agreement is subject to higher or otherwise better
offers at the Auction (if any) in accordance with these Bidding Procedures,
and, as such, the Stalking Horse Agreement will serve as the "stalking horse"
bid for the Purchased Assets.

Stalking Horse Bidder who wishes to participate in the bidding process (a "
_Potential Bidder_ ") must (to the extent not previously provided) provide an
executed confidentiality agreement (to be delivered prior to the distribution
of any confidential information by the Sellers to any Potential Bidder) in
form and substance satisfactory to the Sellers, on terms not less favorable
in the aggregate to the Sellers than the confidentiality agreement signed by
the Stalking Horse Bidder, as determined by the Sellers, and without limiting
the foregoing, each confidentiality agreement executed by a Potential Bidder
shall contain standard non-solicitation provisions, as determined by the
Sellers.

  



   | 3.| Due Diligence 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Sellers will afford any Potential Bidder that has executed or that will
execute a confidentiality agreement in accordance with paragraph 2 above such
due diligence access or additional information as the Sellers, in

within their reasonable business judgment. The Sellers will use good faith
efforts to provide to the Stalking Horse Bidder access to written information
made available to any Qualified Bidder (as defined below) if not previously
made available to the Stalking Horse Bidder.

The due diligence period shall end on the Bid Deadline, and none of the
Sellers nor any of their representatives shall be obligated to furnish any due
diligence information to any Qualified Bidder after the Bid Deadline,

Stalking Horse Bidder.

  



   | 4.| Provisions Governing Qualified Bids 
---|---|--- 
  



  

A bid submitted will be considered a " _Qualified Bid_ " only if the bid
complies with all of the following, in which case the party submitting the bid
shall be a " _Qualified Bidder_ "; _provided_ that, if the Debtors receive a
bid prior to the Bid Deadline that is not a Qualified Bid, the Debtors may
provide the bidder with the opportunity to remedy any deficiencies prior to
the Auction:

or team bidder), and the complete terms of any such participation, including
any agreements, arrangements or understandings concerning a collaborative or
joint bid or any other combination concerning the proposed bid. A bid must
also fully disclose any connections, relationships (business or otherwise),

favorable to the Sellers than the terms and conditions of the Stalking Horse
Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, any Qualified Bid must, either on its
own or when considered together with other Qualified Bid(s), provide value in

until four (4) months after the execution of the applicable Proposed Asset
Purchase Agreement (as defined herein). Such writing shall guarantee
performance of the Qualified Bidder by its parent entities, if any, or provide
such other guarantee of performance requested by and acceptable to the
Sellers; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | g.| it shall be accompanied by a deposit into escrow with the Sellers
of an amount in cash equal to ten percent (10%) of the aggregate purchase

Purchase Agreement_ ") and a proposed form of order to approve the sale,
together with a copy marked to show amendments and modifications to the
proposed form of sale approval order attached to the motion to approve the

_however_ , that such Proposed Asset Purchase Agreement shall not include any

favorable to the Sellers than the conditions in the Stalking Horse Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | j.| it includes written evidence of (i) sufficient cash on hand to
fund the purchase price or (ii) sources of immediately available funds that
are not conditioned on third-party approvals or commitments, in each case,

transaction contemplated by the Proposed Asset Purchase Agreement. Such
written evidence shall include the most current audited and the most current
unaudited financial statements, or such other financial information of the
Qualified Bidder as may be requested by and acceptable to the Sellers

entity formed for the purpose of acquiring some or all of the Purchased
Assets, the Financials of the Qualified Bidder's equity holder(s) or other
financial backer(s) that are guaranteeing the Qualified Bidder's performance;
_provided_ that if a Potential Bidder is unable to provide Financials, the
Sellers may accept such other information sufficient to demonstrate to each
Seller's reasonable satisfaction that such Potential Bidder has the financial
wherewithal to consummate the applicable sale transaction. The Potential
Bidder also must establish to the Sellers' satisfaction that it has the
financial ability to consummate its proposed transaction within the timeframe
contemplated for consummation of the Stalking Horse Agreement;

liabilities assumed in the Stalking Horse Agreement); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | l.| it identifies with particularity which executory contracts and
unexpired leases the Qualified Bidder wishes to assume and provides details
of the Qualified Bidder's proposal for the treatment of related Cure Costs (as

performance and closing of the Proposed Asset Purchase Agreement; 
---|---|---

   | o.| it provides an irrevocable undertaking by the Qualified Bidder to

assurance acceptable to the Sellers in their discretion; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | p.| it states that the Qualified Bidder consents to the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court, as applicable; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | q.| it contains such other information reasonably requested by the
Sellers; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | r.| it contains written confirmation that the bidder has not engaged

   | s.| it is received by the applicable Notice Parties (as defined in,
and in accordance with, Section B.5) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (prevailing
Eastern Time) on [●], 2019 (the " _Bid Deadline_ "). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Notwithstanding anything in these Bidding Procedures to the contrary, the
Buyer is deemed to be a Qualified Bidder with respect to the Purchased Assets
and the Stalking Horse Bid is deemed to be a Qualified Bid for all purposes
in connection with the Bidding Procedures, the Auction, and the Sale, and the
Stalking Horse Bidder shall not be required to take any further action in
order to attend and participate in the Auction (if any) or, if the Stalking
Horse Bidder is the Successful Bidder, to be named the Successful Bidder at
the Sale Hearing.

  



  

The [DIP Agent], on behalf of the [DIP Lenders], and the [Prepetition Agent],
on behalf of the [Prepetition Lenders], shall, at their sole discretion, also
be deemed Qualified Bidders and may submit such bids and/or Subsequent Bids
in cash, cash equivalents or other forms of consideration, including a credit
bid, either in whole or in part, to the extent permitted under and consistent
with section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code, up to the full allowed amount of
their claims, which credit bid(s) shall be deemed as a part of a Qualified
Bid and/or Subsequent Bid in connection with the bidding process, the Auction,
and the sale of the Purchased Assets. 4

  



  

The Sellers shall promptly notify each Qualified Bidder in writing (including
via email) as to whether or not its bid constitutes a Qualified Bid. If any
bid is determined by the Sellers not to be a Qualified Bid, the Debtors will
refund such bidder's Good Faith Deposit and all accumulated interest thereon
within ten (10) business days after the Bid Deadline. The Sellers shall also
notify the Stalking Horse Bidder and all other Qualified Bidders in writing
(including via email) as to whether or not any bids constitute Qualified Bids
no later than one (1) business day after the notification to any Qualified
Bidder that its bid constitutes a Qualified Bid and provide a copy of
Qualified Bids (excluding the Stalking Horse Agreement) to the Stalking Horse
Bidder. The notices described in this paragraph shall not be given later than
one (1) business day following the expiration of the Bid Deadline.

 _Consultation Parties_. The " _Consultation Parties_ " are (a) the DIP Agent
and its counsel and advisors with respect to the Purchased Assets, and (b)
counsel and any other retained advisors to the creditors' committee appointed
in the Sellers' bankruptcy cases. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Sellers shall not be required to consult with any Consultation
Party during the bidding and Auction process to the extent such Consultation
Party is a Potential Bidder, a Qualified Bidder, or a financing source for a
bidder, including, if the Sellers determine, in their reasonable business
judgment, that consulting with such Consultation Party regarding any issue,
selection or determination would be likely to have a chilling effect on
potential bidding or otherwise be contrary to goal of maximizing value for
the Sellers' estates from the sale process.

  



  

Subject to the terms of any orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court, after
consultation with the Consultation Parties, the Sellers shall have the right
and obligation to make all decisions regarding bids and the Auction as
provided herein as the Sellers determine to be in the best interest of their
estates, whether or not the Consultation Parties agree with that decision.

  



   | 5.| Submission of Bids 
---|---|--- 
  



  

A Qualified Bidder that desires to make a bid regarding some or all of the
Purchased Assets must deliver written copies of its bid, so as to be received
on or before the Bid Deadline, to each of the following parties (the "
_Notice Parties_ "):

  



   | a.| counsel to the Sellers: Lowenstein Sandler LLP, 1251 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, New York 10020 (Attn: Steven E. Siesser, Esq.

   | c.| counsel to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors:
________________________ (Attn: ________________________, Esq.
(________________________) and ________________________, Esq.

---|---|--- 
  



   | 6.| Evaluation of Competing Bids 
---|---|--- 
  



  

A Qualified Bid will be valued based upon several factors including, without
limitation: (a) the amount of such bid (including value provided by the
assumption of liabilities); (b) the risks and timing associated with
consummating such bid; (c) any proposed revisions to the Stalking Horse
Agreement (including any additional conditions to closing); and (d) any other
factors deemed relevant by the Sellers.

  



   | 7.| No Qualified Bids 
---|---|--- 
  



  

If the Sellers do not receive a Qualified Bid with respect to the Purchased

   | 8.| Auction Process 
---|---|--- 
  



  

If the Sellers receive one or more Qualified Bids with respect to the
Purchased Assets in addition to the Stalking Horse Bid, the Sellers will
conduct an auction (the " _Auction_ ") for the Purchased Assets (which the
Sellers intend to transcribe) at 10:00 a.m. (prevailing Eastern Time) on [●],
2019, at the offices of Lowenstein Sandler LLP, 1251 Avenue of the Americas,
New York, New York 10020, or such other location as shall be timely
communicated by the Sellers to all entities entitled to attend the Auction.
The Auction shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures:

  



   | a.| only the Sellers, the Notice Parties, the Stalking Horse Bidder,
and any other Qualified Bidders, in each case along with their
representatives and advisors, shall be entitled to attend the Auction (such
attendance to be in person); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | b.| only the Stalking Horse Bidder and such other Qualified Bidders
will be entitled to participate as bidders in, or make any Subsequent Bids
at, the Auction; _provided_ that all such Qualified Bidders wishing to attend
the Auction must have at least one individual representative with authority
to bind such Qualified Bidder attending the Auction in person; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | c.| each Qualified Bidder shall be required to confirm in a manner
acceptable to the Sellers that it has not engaged in any collusion with
respect to the bidding or the sale; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | d.| at least one (1) business day prior to the Auction, each Qualified
Bidder (other than a Stalking Horse Bidder) must inform the Sellers whether
it intends to attend the Auction; _provided_ that in the event a Qualified
Bidder elects not to attend the Auction, such Qualified Bidder's Qualified
Bid shall, subject to the terms of the Stalking Horse Agreement, nevertheless
remain fully enforceable against such Qualified Bidder until (i) the date of
the selection of the Successful Bidder at the conclusion of the Auction, or
(ii) if selected as the Successful Bidder, four (4) months after the execution
of the applicable Proposed Asset Purchase Agreement. No later than two (2)
business days prior to the start of the Auction, the Sellers will provide
copies of the Qualified Bid (or combination of Qualified Bids, if applicable)
which the Sellers believe, in their discretion, is the highest or otherwise
best offer for the Purchased Assets (the " _Starting Bid_ ") to the
Stalking Horse Bidder and all other Qualified Bidders; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | e.| all Qualified Bidders who have timely submitted Qualified Bids
will be entitled to be present for all Subsequent Bids at the Auction and the
actual identity of each Qualified Bidder will be disclosed on the record at
the Auction; 
---|---|--- 
  



    

-8- 
--- 

 



    



   | f.| the Sellers, after consultation with their advisors, may employ
and announce at the Auction additional procedural rules that are reasonable
under the circumstances for conducting the Auction, _provided_ that such
rules: (i) are not inconsistent with these Bidding Procedures, title 11 of
the United States Code (the " _Bankruptcy Code_ "), any order of the
Bankruptcy Court entered in connection herewith or the Stalking Horse
Agreement; (ii) provide that bids be made and received on an open basis, with
all material terms of each bid to be fully disclosed to all other Qualified
Bidders at the Auction; and (iii) are disclosed to each Qualified Bidder at
the Auction; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | g.| bidding at the Auction will begin with the Starting Bid and
continue in bidding increments (each a " _Subsequent Bid_ ") providing a net
value to the Sellers' estates of at least an additional $1,000,000 above the
prior bid for the Purchased Assets. After the first round of bidding and
between each subsequent round of bidding, the Sellers shall announce the bid
(including the identity of the bidder or bidders and the value of such bid(s))
that they believe to be the highest or otherwise best offer for the Purchased
Assets (the " _Highest Bid_ "). A round of bidding will conclude after each
participating Qualified Bidder has had the opportunity, as determined by the
Sellers, to submit a Subsequent Bid with full knowledge of the then Highest
Bid. For the purpose of evaluating the value of the consideration provided by
the Subsequent Bids (including any Subsequent Bid by the Stalking Horse
Bidder), the Sellers will give effect (on a dollar for dollar basis) to the
Break-Up Fee and the maximum amount of the Expense Reimbursement payable to
the Stalking Horse Bidder under the Stalking Horse Agreement as well as any
additional liabilities to be assumed by a Qualified Bidder and any additional
costs which may be imposed on the Sellers, as well as any other items of
value included in such Subsequent Bid. If the Stalking Horse Bidder bids at
the Auction, the Stalking Horse Bidder will be entitled to credit bid on a
dollar for dollar basis the amount of the Break-Up Fee and the maximum amount
of the Expense Reimbursement. To the extent a Subsequent Bid has been accepted
entirely or in part because of the addition, deletion or modification of a
provision or provisions in the applicable Proposed Asset Purchase Agreement or
Stalking Horse Agreement, the Sellers will identify such added, deleted or
modified provision or provisions and the Qualified Bidders shall be given
the opportunity to modify the applicable Proposed Asset Purchase Agreement or
Stalking Horse Agreement in a manner that materially provides any additional
value that factored into selecting a Subsequent Bid from another Qualified
Bidder. The Sellers shall, in consultation with the Consultation Parties,
determine whether an addition, deletion or modification of the applicable
Proposed Asset Purchase Agreement or Stalking Horse Agreement meets the
standard of materially providing additional value. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Stalking Horse Bidder shall be entitled to submit additional bids
and make modifications to the Stalking Horse Agreement at the Auction
consistent with these Bidding Procedures; 
---|---|--- 
  



    

-9- 
--- 

 



    



   | h.| the Sellers shall, in their reasonable discretion and after
consultation with the Consultation Parties, honor reasonable requests for
breaks in the auction; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | i.| the Auction may be adjourned as the Sellers, in consultation with
the Consultation Parties, deem appropriate. Reasonable notice of such
adjournment and the time and place for the resumption of the Auction shall be
given to the Stalking Horse Bidder, all other Qualified Bidders, the United
States Trustee and the Consultation Parties. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 9.| Selection of Successful Bid 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Prior to the conclusion of the Auction, the Sellers, in consultation with
their advisors and the Consultation Parties, will review and evaluate each
Qualified Bid in accordance with the procedures set forth herein and
determine which offer for the Purchased Assets is the highest or otherwise
best offer from among the Qualified Bidders (including the Stalking Horse
Bidder) submitted at or prior to the Auction by a Qualified Bidder (such bid,
the " _Successful Bid_ " and the bidder making such bid, the " _Successful
Bidder_ ") and communicate to the Stalking Horse Bidder and the other
Qualified Bidders the identity of the Successful Bidder and the
material terms of the Successful Bid. The determination of the Successful Bid
by the Sellers at the conclusion of the Auction shall be final, subject only
to approval by the Bankruptcy Court.

  



  

By submitting a Qualified Bid, all Qualified Bidders and the Stalking Horse
Bidder expressly agree that they shall not submit additional bids or seek to
reopen the Auction after the Sellers have selected the Successful Bid and
Back-Up Bid, if any, and any such bid shall not be considered by the
Sellers or the Bankruptcy Court. As soon as reasonably practicable after
conclusion of the Auction, the Successful Bidder shall complete and execute
all agreements, contracts, instruments and other documents evidencing and
containing the terms and conditions upon which the Successful Bid was made.
Within one (1) business day after conclusion of the Auction, the Sellers shall
file a notice identifying the Successful Bidder with the Bankruptcy Court.

  



  

The Sellers will sell the Purchased Assets to the Successful Bidder pursuant
to the terms of the Successful Bid upon the approval of such Successful Bid by
the Bankruptcy Court.

  



   | 10.| Designation of Back-Up Bidder 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Notwithstanding anything in these Bidding Procedures to the contrary, if an
Auction is conducted, the Qualified Bidder with the next highest or otherwise
best bid at the conclusion of the Auction for the Purchased Assets, as
determined by the Sellers, in the exercise of their business judgment,
shall be deemed to have submitted the next highest or otherwise best bid for
such assets (such bid, a " _Back-Up Bid_ " and the Qualified Bidder
submitting such bid, a " _Back-Up Bidder_ ") and shall be announced at the
time to all Qualified Bidders participating in the Auction.

  



    

-10- 
--- 

 



    



  

If for any reason the Successful Bidder fails to consummate its Successful
Bid within the time permitted after the entry of the Sale Order, then the
Sellers may deem the Back-Up Bidder to be the new Successful Bidder and its
Back-Up Bid to be the new Successful Bid, and the Sellers will be
authorized (but not directed), without further order of the Bankruptcy Court,
to consummate a sale transaction with such Back-Up Bidder on the terms of its
Back-Up Bid; _provided_ , that if the Sellers elect to do so, the Sellers,
within their discretion, (i) will file a written notice of such transaction
with the Bankruptcy Court at least 24 hours in advance of consummation
thereof, and/or (ii) may (but shall not be required to) seek approval for the
consummation of such sale transaction with such Back-Up Bidder pursuant to a
separate order to be submitted at a later date consistent with the terms of
the Back-Up Bid.

  



  

Each Back-Up Bid must remain open until four (4) months after execution of
the applicable Stalking Horse Agreement or Proposed Asset Purchase Agreement
(the " _Outside Back-Up Date_ "), except in the event the Stalking Horse
Bidder is designated as the Back-Up Bidder in which case the Stalking Horse
Bidder shall not be permitted to terminate the Stalking Horse Agreement until
the earlier of (a) the date upon which an Alternative Transaction has been
consummated following approval by the Bankruptcy Court, (b) 90 days after
entry of an order approving a sale to a Successful Bidder other than the
Stalking Horse Bidder and (c) August 15, 2019.

  



   | 11.| Good Faith Deposit 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph with respect to the Successful
Bid and Back-Up Bid, if any, the Good Faith Deposits of all Qualified Bidders
that submitted such a deposit under the Bidding Procedures shall be returned
upon or within three (3) business days after the Auction. The Good
Faith Deposit of a Successful Bidder shall be held until the closing of the
sale of the Purchased Assets and applied in accordance with the Successful
Bid. The Good Faith Deposit of any Back-Up Bidder (other than the Stalking
Horse Bidder) shall be returned within three (3) business days after the
Outside Back-Up Date. If the Successful Bidder fails to consummate an approved
sale because of a breach or failure to perform on the part of such Successful
Bidder, the Sellers will not have any obligation to return the Good Faith
Deposit deposited by such Successful Bidder, which may be retained by the
Sellers as liquidated damages, in addition to any and all rights, remedies
and/or causes of action that may be available to the Sellers at law or in
equity, and, the Sellers shall be free to consummate the proposed transaction
at the next highest or otherwise best bid at the Auction by a Qualified
Bidder, without the need for an additional hearing or order of the Bankruptcy
Court. Notwithstanding any provision hereof, the terms pertaining to any Good
Faith Deposit submitted by the Stalking Horse Bidder pursuant to the Stalking
Horse Agreement (including, without limitation, the entitlements of the
Stalking Horse Bidder and Sellers to such good faith deposit and the timing of
return of any Good Faith Deposit to the Stalking Horse Bidder) shall be
governed by the terms of the Stalking Horse Agreement and the Bidding
Procedures Order.

  



   | 12.| Sale Is As Is/Where Is 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise provided in the Stalking Horse Agreement, any Proposed
Asset Purchase Agreement, the Successful Bid or any order of the Bankruptcy
Court approving the sale of the Purchased Assets, the Purchased Assets sold
pursuant to these Bidding Procedures shall be conveyed at the closing of
the sale in their then-present condition, "AS IS, WITH ALL FAULTS, AND
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED."

  



    

-11-

   | C.| THE BID PROTECTIONS 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In recognition of the expenditure of time, energy, and resources, and because
the agreement to make payment thereof is necessary to preserve the value of
each of the Sellers' estates, the Sellers have agreed that, among other
triggering events, if the Buyer is not the Successful Bidder, then the
Sellers will pay the Buyer, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of
the Stalking Horse Agreement, (a) an aggregate "break-up" fee of $6,760,000,
as more fully described in the Stalking Horse Agreement (as defined therein,
the " _Break-Up Fee_ "), and (b) an amount in cash equal to the Expense
Reimbursement (as such term is defined in the Stalking Horse Agreement (the "
_Expense Reimbursement_ "), which is not to exceed $2,000,000. The Break-Up
Fee and Expense Reimbursement shall be payable as provided for pursuant to
the terms of the Stalking Horse Agreement, and nothing herein shall be deemed
to limit or otherwise modify the terms thereof, including other circumstances
pursuant to which the Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement may be payable.

  



  

Except for the Stalking Horse Bidder, no Qualified Bidder or other party
submitting a bid shall be entitled to any expense reimbursement, breakup fee,
termination or similar fee or payment.

  



   | D.| SALE HEARING 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Sellers will seek entry of an order from the Bankruptcy Court, at a
hearing (the " _Sale Hearing_ ") to begin at 10:00 a.m. (prevailing Eastern
Time) on [●], 2019 or as soon thereafter as counsel may be heard, to approve
and authorize the sale to the Successful Bidder (including, without
limitation, the assumption and assignment to the Successful Bidder of any
executory contracts or unexpired leases to be assigned to the Successful
Bidder in accordance with the Stalking Horse Agreement or Proposed Asset
Purchase Agreement, as applicable, at the Sale Hearing on terms and
conditions determined in accordance with the Bidding Procedures).

  



   | E.| MISCELLANEOUS 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Auction and the Bidding Procedures are solely for the benefit of the
Sellers and the Stalking Horse Bidder, and nothing contained in the Bidding
Procedures Order, the Bidding Procedures or the Stalking Horse Agreement
shall create any rights in any other person or bidder (including,
without limitation, rights as third-party beneficiaries or otherwise) other
than the rights expressly granted to the Successful Bidder under the Bidding
Procedures Order.

  



  

Without prejudice to the rights of the Stalking Horse Bidder under the terms
of the Stalking Horse Agreement and the Bidding Procedures Order, the Sellers
may modify the rules, procedures and deadlines set forth herein, or adopt new
rules, procedures and deadlines that, in their reasonable discretion, will
better promote the goals of these Bidding Procedures (namely, to obtain the
highest or otherwise best bid); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Sellers
may not modify the Bid Protections afforded to the Stalking Horse Bidder in
accordance with the Stalking Horse Agreement, unless agreed in writing by the
Stalking Horse Bidder and Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Sellers may not modify the rules, procedures, or deadlines set forth herein,
or adopt new rules, procedures, or deadlines that would impair in any
material respect the Stalking Horse Bidder's right to payment of the Break-Up
Fee or the Expense Reimbursement without the express written consent of the
Stalking Horse Bidder. All such modifications and additional rules will be
communicated to each of the Notice Parties, Potential Bidders, and Qualified
Bidders (including the Stalking Horse Bidder) or announced at the Auction.

  



  

The Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction to hear and
determine all matters arising from or relating to implementation of the
Bidding Procedures Order.

before this Court; and after due deliberation and sufficient cause
appearing therefor, it is hereby

  



    

-3- 
--- 

 



    



  

FOUND, CONCLUDED, AND DETERMINED THAT:

  



  

A. The Debtors have demonstrated good and sufficient reasons for, and
the best interests of their estates, creditors, and other parties in interest
will be served by, this Court granting, to the extent provided herein, the
relief requested in the Motion relating to the bidding process, including
approval of (1) the Bidding Procedures, (2) the Bid Protections, (3) the
Assumption and Assignment Procedures, and (4) the forms of the Sale Notice
(as defined below) and Cure Notice (as defined below) attached to the Motion
as  _Exhibit [ ●]_ and _Exhibit [ ●]_, respectively.

  



  

B. Good and sufficient business reasons exist for the Court to
authorize the Debtors to enter into Stalking Horse Agreement in
accordance with the terms of this Order and the Bidding Procedures.

  



  

C. The Debtors have demonstrated good and sufficient reasons for, and
the best interests of their estates will be served by, this Court scheduling
the Sale Hearing to consider granting the other relief requested in the
Motion, including approval of the Sale and the transfer of the Purchased
Assets (and the assumption and assignment of the Buyer Assumed Agreements) to
the Successful Bidder free and clear of all Liens, Claims and other
Liabilities, except as set forth in the Stalking Horse Agreement, pursuant to
sections 363(f) and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

  



  

D. The Bid Protections as set forth in Section [7.3] of the Stalking
Horse Agreement to be paid under the circumstances described therein to the
Stalking Horse Bidder are: (1) an actual and necessary cost of preserving the
value of the respective Debtors' estates within the meaning of section 503(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code; (2) commensurate to the real and substantial benefits
conferred upon the Debtors' estates by the Stalking Horse Bidder; and (3)
reasonable and appropriate in light of the size and nature of the proposed
Sale and comparable transactions, the commitments and accommodations of the
Stalking Horse Bidder that have been made for the benefit of the Debtors'
estates, and the efforts that have been and will be expended by the Stalking
Horse Bidder.

  



    

-4- 
--- 

 



    



  

E. The Bid Protections are the product of negotiations between the
Debtors and the Stalking Horse Bidder conducted in good faith and at arm's
length, and the Stalking Horse Agreement (including the Bid Protections) is
the culmination of a process undertaken by the Debtors and their
professionals to negotiate a transaction with a bidder who was prepared to pay
the highest or otherwise best purchase price for the Purchased Assets to
maximize the value of the Debtors' estates.

  



  

F. Moreover, the Bid Protections are an essential and material
inducement and express condition of the Stalking Horse Bidder's entry
into, and continuing obligations under, the Stalking Horse Agreement. Unless
it is assured that the Bid Protections will be available, the Stalking Horse
Bidder is unwilling to remain obligated to consummate the Sale or otherwise be
bound under the Stalking Horse Agreement (including the Stalking Horse
Bidder's obligation to maintain its committed offer while such offer is
subject to higher or otherwise better offers as contemplated by the Bidding
Procedures). The Bid Protections have induced the Stalking Horse Bidder to
submit a bid that will serve as a minimum or floor bid for the Purchased
Assets on which the Debtors, their creditors and other bidders can rely, and
which encourages and facilitates the Auction process. The Stalking Horse
Bidder has thus provided a material benefit to the Debtors, their estates and
creditors by increasing the likelihood that the best possible purchase
price for the Purchased Assets will be realized. Accordingly, the Bid
Protections are fair, reasonable and appropriate, and necessary to facilitate
a competitive, value-maximizing Sale for the benefit of the Debtors' estates.

  



    

-5- 
--- 

 



    



  

G. The Stalking Horse Bidder is not an "insider" or "affiliate" of any
of the Debtors, as those terms are defined in section 101 of the Bankruptcy
Code, and no common identity of incorporators, directors, or controlling
stakeholders exist between the Stalking Horse Bidder and the Debtors. The
Stalking Horse Bidder and its counsel and advisors have acted in "good
faith" within the meaning of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code in
connection with the Stalking Horse Bidder's negotiations of the Bid
Protections and the Bidding Procedures and entry into the Stalking Horse
Agreement.

  



  

H. The Bidding Procedures are fair, reasonable, and appropriate and are
designed to maximize the recovery from the Sale of the Purchased Assets.

  



  

I. The process for submitting Qualified Bids is fair, reasonable, and
appropriate and is designed to maximize recoveries for the benefit of the
Debtors' estates, creditors, and parties in interest.

  



  

J. Good and sufficient notice of the relief sought in the Motion has
been provided under the circumstances, and no other or further notice is
required except as set forth in the Bidding Procedures and the Assumption and
Assignment Procedures. A reasonable opportunity to object or be heard
regarding the relief requested in the Motion has been afforded to all parties
in interest.

  



  

K. The Sale Notice, the Cure Notice, and the Supplemental Cure Notice
(each as defined below) are appropriate and reasonably calculated to provide
all interested parties with timely and proper notice of this Order, the
Bidding Procedures, the Sale, the Sale Hearing, and any and all objection
deadlines related thereto, including with respect to cure amounts and the
assumption and assignment of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, and no
other or further notice is required of the foregoing.

L. The findings and conclusions set forth herein constitute the Court's
findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 7052 made
applicable to this proceeding pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9014. To the extent
any of the foregoing findings of fact constitute conclusions of law, they are
adopted as such. To the extent any of the following conclusions of law
constitute findings of fact, they are adopted as such.

The Stalking Horse Bidder shall be granted an allowed administrative expense claim under sections 503(b)(1) and 507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code in an amount equal to the Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement to the extent they become due in accordance with the terms of the Stalking Horse Agreement, which (if triggered) shall be payable from the proceeds of the Sale of the Purchased Assets at the closing of such Sale, in accordance with the terms of the Stalking Horse Agreement, without further order of or proceedings before this Court. Nothing in this Order shall be construed as authorizing and directing the payment of any Bid Protections to the Stalking Horse Bidder in the event the Stalking Horse Bidder becomes the Successful Bidder with respect to the Purchased Assets.

  



  

10. No person or entity, other than the Stalking Horse Bidder, shall be entitled to any expense reimbursement, break-up fee, "topping," or other similar fee or payment.

The automatic stay imposed by section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code is modified solely to the extent necessary to implement the preceding sentence,  _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that this Court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction over any and all disputes with respect thereto.

   | VI.| Assumption and Assignment Procedures 
---|---|--- 
  



  

18. The Notice of Assumption and Assignment of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases in Connection with Proposed Sale of Certain Assets of the Debtors, in the form substantially similar to that attached to the Motion as _Exhibit [ ●]_ (the " _Cure Notice_ ")9, is approved.

  



  

19. The Debtors shall, within five (5) business days of the entry of this Order, serve the Cure Notice upon each non-Debtor counterparty to each Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease to which a Seller is a party that may be assumed and assigned to the Stalking Horse Bidder, regardless of whether, at that time, the Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease is listed as being proposed to be assumed and assigned to the Stalking Horse Bidder. The Cure Notice shall state the date, time and place of the Sale Hearing and the date by which any objection to the assumption and assignment of such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease must be filed and served. The Cure Notice shall also identify the amounts, if any, that the Debtors believe are owed to each counterparty to an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease to cure any defaults that exist under such contract or lease (such amounts, the " _Cure Costs_ ") pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Cure Notice does not constitute an admission that an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease is in fact an executory contract or unexpired lease for the purposes of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the Debtors reserve any and all rights with respect to the Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases. The inclusion of an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease on the Cure Notice shall not obligate the Successful Bidder to take assignment of such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease. Only those contracts that constitute (a) Buyer Assumed Agreements pursuant to the Stalking Horse Agreement or (b) if the Successful Bidder is not the Stalking Horse Bidder, Buyer Assumed Agreements identified in the Successful Bidder's Proposed Asset Purchase Agreement, shall be assumed, assigned and sold to such Successful Bidder.

20. If any counterparty to an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease objects for any reason to any proposed Cure Costs set forth in the Cure Notice or any Supplemental Cure Notice, such counterparty must (a) file with the Court a written objection (a " _Cure Costs Objection_ ") and (b) serve such Cure Costs Objection, so as to be received no later than ten (10) days after service of the Cure Notice or Supplemental Cure Notice, as applicable (the " _Cure Objection Deadline_ "), on: (i) counsel to the Debtors, Lowenstein Sandler LLP, 1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020 (Attn: Steven E. Siesser, Esq. (ssiesser@lowenstein.com), Paul Kizel, Esq. (pkizel@lowenstein.com) and Philip J. Gross, Esq. (pgross@lowenstein.com)); (ii) counsel to the Buyer, Ropes and Gray LLP, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 (Attn: John E. Sorkin, Esq. (john.sorkin@ropesgray.com), Robb Tretter, Esq. (robb.tretter@ropesgray.com) and Matthew Roose, Esq. (Matthew.Roose@ropesgray.com); (iii) the Office of The United States Trustee, One Newark Center 1085, Raymond Boulevard, Suite 2100, Newark, NJ 07102 [(Attn: _____________________, Esq.)]; and (iv) proposed counsel to the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, ________________________, ________________________ (Attn: ________________________, Esq. (________________________) and ________________________, Esq. (________________________)) (collectively, the " _Notice Parties_ ").

21. If, at any time and from time to time after the entry of this Order, the Debtors or the Stalking Horse Bidder or other Successful Bidder identify additional Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases to be assumed and assigned as Buyer Assumed Agreements in accordance with the terms of the Stalking Horse Agreement or Successful Bidder's Proposed Asset Purchase Agreement, the Debtors shall serve a supplemental Cure Notice (the " _Supplemental Cure Notice_ ") by facsimile, electronic transmission, hand delivery or overnight mail on the applicable non-debtor counterparty and its counsel (if known) no later than ten (10) days before the closing (" _Closing_ ") of the Sale, or, if such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease is identified less than ten (10) days prior to the Closing, by the date set forth on the Supplemental Cure Notice. Each Supplemental Cure Notice shall: (a) state the date, time and place of the Sale Hearing (or later hearing, if applicable); (b) state the date by which any objection to the assumption and assignment of such Buyer Assumed Agreement must be filed and served; and (c) identify the proposed Cure Costs, if any.

  



  

22. Each Cure Costs Objection must set forth with specificity each and every asserted default in any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease and the monetary cure amount asserted by such counterparty to the extent it differs from the Cure Costs, if any, specified by the Debtors in the Cure Notice or Supplemental Cure Notice, as applicable.

  



  

23. In the event that the Debtors and the non-debtor party cannot resolve a Cure Costs Objection, disputed Cure Costs shall not be paid until the resolution of any such disputes by the Court or mutual agreement of the Debtors, with the consent of the Stalking Horse Bidder to the extent required in the Stalking Horse Agreement, and the objecting party. Cure Costs Objections may be resolved by the Court at the Sale Hearing, or at a separate hearing either before or after the Sale Hearing.

24. Any counterparty to an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease that fails to timely file and serve a Cure Costs Objection shall be forever barred from asserting that Cure Costs are owed in an amount in excess of that set forth in the Cure Notice or Supplemental Cure Notice. If no Cure Costs Objection is timely filed and served by the Cure Objection Deadline with respect to a Buyer Assumed Agreement, the Cure Costs identified in the Cure Notice or Supplemental Cure Notice, as applicable, with respect to the Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases shall be the only amounts necessary to be paid to cure all monetary defaults pursuant to section 365(b) of the Bankruptcy Code under such Buyer Assumed Agreement, to the extent the Stalking Horse Bidder (or other Successful Bidder) ultimately decides to have the applicable Buyer Assumed Agreement assumed and assigned to it. Any party failing to timely file a Cure Costs Objection shall be forever barred from objecting to the Cure Costs and from asserting any additional cure or other amounts against the Debtors, their estates or the Successful Bidder, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease, or any other document. To the extent a Cure Costs Objection is resolved or determined unfavorably to the applicable Debtor, such Debtor may, with the prior written consent of the Successful Bidder, seek to instead reject the applicable Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease after such determination.

  



  

25. If any counterparty to an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease objects to the assumption and assignment of such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease for any reason (including with respect to adequate assurance of future performance) other than the amount of the proposed Cure Costs (an " _Assignment Objection_ "), such counterparty must file and serve such Assignment Objection so as to be received by the Notice Parties by no later than ten (10) days after service of the Cure Notice or Supplemental Cure Notice, as applicable (the " _Assignment Objection Deadline_ "). The Court shall make any and all determinations concerning an Assignment Objection, including adequate assurance of future performance under the Buyer Assumed Agreements pursuant to sections 365(b) and (f)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, at the Sale Hearing (or such later hearing as may be requested by the Debtors).

26. If no Assignment Objection is timely filed and served by the Assignment Objection Deadline, the counterparty to an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease shall be deemed to have consented to the assumption, assignment and sale of the Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease to the Successful Bidder if such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease is elected by the Successful Bidder as a Buyer Assumed Agreement and shall be forever barred from asserting any objection with regard to such assumption, assignment and sale; _provided_ ,  _however_ , in the event that the Successful Bidder is not the Stalking Horse Bidder, the non-debtor parties to the Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases to be assumed and assigned to such Successful Bidder shall have until 4:00 p.m. on the date that is one (1) business day prior to the Sale Hearing to object to the assumption, assignment and/or sale of their Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases to such Successful Bidder; _provided further_ , _however_ , any such objection may relate solely to adequate assurance of future performance by such Successful Bidder pursuant to sections 365(b) and (f)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.

  



  

27. The Stalking Horse Bidder may add or remove any Assumed Contract to be assumed by the Debtors and assigned to the Stalking Horse Bidder at any time prior to five (5) days prior to the Sale Hearing in accordance with the terms of the Stalking Horse Agreement.

of law constitute findings of fact, they are adopted as such.

  



  

 _Notice of the Sale Motion, Auction, Sale Hearing, Purchase Agreement and
Sale and the Cure Costs_

  



  

D. As evidenced by declarations and/or affidavits of service and
publication previously filed with this Court, proper, timely, adequate, and
sufficient notice of the Sale Motion, the Auction, the Sale Hearing, the
Purchase Agreement, and the Sale has been provided in accordance with
sections 102(1), 363, and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules
2002, 6004, 6006, 9007 and 9014. The Debtors have complied with all
obligations to provide notice of the Sale Motion, the Auction, the Sale
Hearing, the Purchase Agreement, and the Sale as required by the Bidding
Procedures Order. The foregoing notice was good, sufficient, and appropriate
under the circumstances, and no other or further notice of the Sale Motion,
the Auction, the Sale Hearing, the Purchase Agreement, or the Sale is
required. With respect to entities whose identities are not reasonably
ascertained by the Debtors, publication of the Sale Notice (as defined in the
Sale Motion) in [the _New York Times_ ] on [l], 2019 was sufficient and
reasonably calculated under the circumstances to reach such entities.

E. A reasonable opportunity to object or to be heard regarding the
relief requested in the Sale Motion was afforded to all interested persons
and entities.

  



  

F. In accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order, the Debtors
have served a notice of their intent to assume and assign the Buyer
Assumed Agreements and of the Cure Costs upon each counterparty to a Buyer
Assumed Agreement. The service and provision of such notice was good,
sufficient, and appropriate under the circumstances and no further notice need
be given in respect of assumption and assignment of the Buyer Assumed
Agreements or establishing a Cure Cost for the respective Buyer Assumed
Agreements. Counterparties to the Buyer Assumed Agreements have had an
adequate opportunity to object to assumption and assignment of the applicable
Buyer Assumed Agreements and the Cure Costs set forth in the notice
(including objections related to the adequate assurance of future performance
and objections based on whether applicable law excuses the counterparty from
accepting performance by, or rendering performance to, the Buyer for purposes
of section 365(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code). All objections, responses, or
requests for adequate assurance, if any, have been resolved, overruled, or
denied, as applicable.

  



  

 _Highest and Best Offer_

  



  

G. As demonstrated by the [Declaration(s) of [l], the] evidence
proffered or adduced at the Sale Hearing, and the representations of counsel
made on the record at the Sale Hearing, the Debtors conducted a sale process
in accordance with, and have, along with the Buyer, complied in all material
respects with, the Bidding Procedures Order and afforded a full, fair, and
reasonable opportunity for any interested party to make a higher or otherwise
better offer to purchase the Purchased Assets and assume the Assumed
Liabilities.

     | 
  



  

H. (i) The Debtors and their advisors engaged in a robust and
extensive marketing and sale process, both prior to the commencement of these
Chapter 11 Cases and through the post-petition sale process in accordance with
the Bidding Procedures Order and the sound exercise of the Debtors' business
judgment; (ii) the Debtors conducted a fair and open sale process; (iii) the
sale process, the Bidding Procedures, and the Auction were non-collusive,
duly noticed, and provided a full, fair, reasonable, and adequate
opportunity for any entity that either expressed an interest in acquiring the
Purchased Assets, or who the Debtors believed may have had an interest in
acquiring the Purchased Assets, to make an offer to purchase the Debtors'
assets, including, without limitation the Purchased Assets; (iv) the Debtors
and the Buyer have negotiated and undertaken their roles leading to the entry
into the Purchase Agreement in a diligent, non-collusive, fair, reasonable,
and good faith manner; and (v) the sale process conducted in good faith by
the Debtors pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order and the Bidding
Procedures resulting in the highest or otherwise best value for the Purchased
Assets for the Debtors and their estates, was in the best interests of the
Debtors, their creditors, and all parties in interest. There is no legal or
equitable reason to delay consummation of the Purchase Agreement and the
transactions contemplated therein.

  



  

I. [The Debtors have also determined, in a valid and sound exercise
of their business judgment and in consultation with their advisors and the
Consultation Parties, that the next highest or otherwise best Qualified Bid
(as defined in the Bidding Procedures) (the " _Designated Back-Up Bid_ ") for
the Purchased Assets was that of [l] (the " _Designated Back-Up Bidder_ ")].

     | 
  



  

J. Approval of the Sale Motion and the Purchase Agreement, and the
consummation of the Sale contemplated thereby, is in the best interests of
the Debtors, their respective creditors, estates, and other parties in
interest. The Debtors have demonstrated good, sufficient, and sound business
reasons and justifications for entering into the Sale and the performance of
their obligations under the Purchase Agreement.

  



  

K. The consummation of the Sale outside a plan of reorganization
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement neither impermissibly restructures the
rights of the Debtors' creditors nor impermissibly dictates the terms of a
plan of reorganization or liquidation for the Debtors. The Sale does not
constitute a _sub rosa_ chapter 11 plan.

  



  

L. Entry of an order approving the Purchase Agreement and all the
provisions thereof is a necessary condition precedent to Buyer's consummation
of the Sale, as set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

 _Good Faith of Buyer_

  



  

M. The consideration to be paid by the Buyer under the Purchase
Agreement was negotiated at arm's-length, in good faith and without collusion
pursuant to section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code and constitutes reasonably
equivalent value and fair and adequate consideration for the Purchased
Assets. Specifically: (i) the Buyer recognized that the Debtors were free to
deal with any other party interested in purchasing the Purchased Assets; (ii)
the Buyer complied in all respects with the applicable provisions of the
Bidding Procedures Order in negotiating and entering into the Purchase
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and the Purchase
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions described
therein comply with the Bidding Procedures Order; (iii) the Buyer agreed to
subject its bid to the competitive bid procedures set forth in the Bidding
Procedures Order; (iv) all payments made or to be made by the Buyer in
connection with the Sale have been disclosed in the Purchase Agreement; (v) no
common identity of directors, officers or controlling stockholders exists
among the Buyer and the Debtors and Buyer is not an "insider" or
"affiliate" of the Debtors, as those terms are defined in the Bankruptcy
Code; (vi) the negotiation and execution of the Purchase Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents were at arm's-length and in good faith without
collusion or fraud, and at all times each of the Buyer and the Debtors were
represented by competent counsel of their choosing; and (vii) the Buyer has
not acted in a collusive manner with any person and at all times acted in
good faith and reasonably. The Buyer will be acting in good faith within the
meaning of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code in closing the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
The terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement are fair and
reasonable under the circumstances and were not entered into for the purpose
of, nor do they have the effect of, hindering, delaying, or defrauding the

N. The Debtors and the Buyer, and each of their respective
management, boards of directors, members, officers, directors, employees,
agents, and representatives, have acted in good faith in connection with
negotiations and entry into the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents, and each of the transactions contemplated
therein, were negotiated, proposed, and entered into by the Debtors and the
Buyer in good faith, without collusion or fraud, and from arm's-length
bargaining positions. The Buyer is a "good faith purchaser" within the
meaning of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, and, as such, is entitled
to all the protections afforded thereby.

  



  

 _No Fraudulent Transfer_

  



  

O. The consideration provided by the Buyer pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement for its purchase of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities constitutes reasonably equivalent value and fair
consideration under the Bankruptcy Code, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance
Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, and under the laws of the United
States, any state, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia.

  



  

P. Neither the Buyer nor its past, present and future subsidiaries,
parents, divisions, affiliates, agents, representatives, insurers,
attorneys, successors and assigns, nor any of its nor their respective
directors, managers, officers, employees, shareholders, members,
agents, representatives, attorneys, contractors, subcontractors, independent
contractors, owners, insurance companies or partners (each, a " _Buyer Party_
") is a continuation of the Debtors or their respective estates and no Buyer
Party is holding itself out to the public as a continuation of the Debtors or
their respective estates and the Sale does not amount to a
consolidation, merger, or de facto merger of the Buyer (or any other Buyer
Party) and the Debtors.

 _Validity of Transfer_

  



  

Q. Each Seller's board of directors has authorized the execution
and delivery of the Purchase Agreement and the Sale of the Purchased Assets
to the Buyer. The Debtors (i) have full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver the Purchase Agreement and all other documents
contemplated thereby, as applicable, (ii) have all of the power and authority
necessary to consummate the Sale, and (iii) have taken all action necessary
to authorize and approve the Purchase Agreement and to consummate the Sale,
and no further consents or approvals, other than those expressly provided for
in the Purchase Agreement, are required for the Debtors to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. The Purchased Assets
constitute property of the Debtors' estates within the meaning of section
541(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and title thereto is presently vested in the
Debtors' estates.

  



  

 _Section 363(f) Is Satisfied_

  



  

R. The Sale of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer and the assumption
and assignment to the Buyer of the Buyer Assumed Agreements under the terms
of the Purchase Agreement meets the applicable provisions of section 363(f) of
the Bankruptcy Code such that the Sale of the Purchased Assets will be free
and clear of all Liens, Claims and other Liabilities, and will not subject any
Buyer Party to any liability for any Liens, Claims or other Liabilities
whatsoever (including, without limitation, under any theory of equitable law,
antitrust, or successor or transferee liability), except as expressly provided
in the Purchase Agreement with respect to Assumed Liabilities. All holders of
Liens, Claims or other Liabilities who did not object, or withdrew their
objections to the Sale, are deemed to have consented to the Sale pursuant to
section 363(f)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, and all holders of Liens, Claims
or other Liabilities are adequately protected--thus satisfying section 363(e)
of the Bankruptcy Code--by having their Liens, Claims or other Liabilities,
if any, attach to the proceeds of the Sale ultimately attributable to the
property against or in which they assert Liens, Claims or other Liabilities,
in the same order of priority and with the same validity, force, and effect
that such holder had prior to the Sale, subject to any rights, claims, and
defenses of the Debtors or their estates, as applicable. Those holders of
Liens, Claims or other Liabilities who did object and that have an interest in
the Purchased Assets fall within one or more of the other subsections of
section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code.

S. The transfer of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer under the
Purchase Agreement will be a legal, valid, and effective transfer of all of
the legal, equitable, and beneficial right, title, and interest in and to the
Purchased Assets free and clear of all Liens, Claims and other Liabilities,
except as expressly provided in the Purchase Agreement. The Sellers may sell
their interests in the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Liens, Claims
and other Liabilities, in each case, one or more of the standards set
forth in section 363(f) has been satisfied. The Buyer would not have entered
into the Transaction Documents and would not consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Sale and the
assumption and assignment of the Buyer Assumed Agreements (i) if the transfer
of the Purchased Assets were not free and clear of all Liens, Claims and other
Liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever, including, without limitation,
rights or claims based on any successor, transferee, derivative or
vicarious liability or any similar theory and/or applicable state or federal
law or otherwise or (ii) if the Buyer or any of its affiliates or designees
would, or in the future could, be liable for any interests, including, without
limitation, rights or claims based on any successor, transferee, derivative
or vicarious liability or any similar theory and/or applicable state or
federal law or otherwise, in each case subject only to the Assumed
Liabilities. Not transferring the Purchased Assets free and clear of all
Liens, Claims and other Liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever,
including, without limitation, rights or claims based on any
successor, transferee, derivative or vicarious liability or any similar
theory and/or applicable state or federal law or otherwise (subject only to
the Assumed Liabilities), would adversely impact the Debtors' efforts to
maximize the value of their estates.

 _Assumption and Assignment of the Buyer Assumed Agreements_

  



  

T. The assumption and assignment of the Buyer Assumed Agreements
pursuant to the terms of this Sale Order are integral to the
Purchase Agreement, are in the best interests of the Debtors and their
respective estates, creditors, and other parties in interest, and represent
the reasonable exercise of sound and prudent business judgment by the Debtors.

  



  

U. The Debtors have met all requirements of section 365(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code for each of the Buyer Assumed Agreements. The Buyer and/or
the Debtors have (i) cured and/or provided adequate assurance of cure of any
default existing prior to the Closing under all of the Buyer Assumed
Agreements within the meaning of section 365(b)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code,
(ii) provided compensation or adequate assurance of compensation to any
counterparty for actual pecuniary loss to such party resulting from a default
prior to the Closing under any of the Buyer Assumed Agreements within the
meaning of section 365(b)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, and (iii) provided
adequate assurance of future performance within the meaning of section
365(b)(1)(C) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Buyer has provided adequate
assurance of future performance within the meaning of sections 365(b)(1)(C)
and 365(f)(2)(B) and in accordance with the Bidding Procedures to the extent
that any such assurance is required and not waived by the counterparties
to such Buyer Assumed Agreements.

     | 
  



  

V. At any time prior to the Closing and prior to the rejection of
an executory contract or unexpired lease, the Debtors shall have the right,
upon request of the Buyer and in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order,
to serve a Supplemental Cure Notice upon any non-Debtor counterparty thereto
indicating the Debtors' intent to assume and assign such executory contract or
unexpired lease. The objection deadline for all Buyer Assumed Agreements,
other than those subject to a Supplemental Cure Notice, lapsed on [l], 2019.
Objections, if any, to the proposed assumption and assignment or the Cure
Cost proposed in any Supplemental Cure Notice with respect thereto, must (i)
be in writing, (ii) comply with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy
Rules and the Local Rules, (iii) state with specificity the nature of the
objection and, if the objection pertains to the proposed Cure Cost, the
correct Cure Cost alleged by the objecting counterparty, together with any
applicable and appropriate documentation in support thereof, and (iv) be
filed with the Court and served upon counsel to the Debtors and counsel to
the Buyer so as to be actually received on or before the deadline set forth in
the applicable Supplemental Cure Notice, which shall be no earlier than seven
(7) calendar days after service thereof. If the parties cannot agree on a
resolution of any such objection, the Debtors will seek an expedited hearing
before the Court to determine the Cure Cost or other matter in dispute
and approve the assumption and assignment of such executory contract or
unexpired lease to Buyer. If no objection is filed prior to the applicable
objection deadline, then the counterparties will be deemed to have consented
to the assumption and assignment to Buyer and the Cure Cost, and such
assumption and assignment to Buyer and the Cure Cost shall be deemed approved
by this Sale Order without further order of this Court.

W. The (i) transfer of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer and (ii)
assignment to the Buyer of the Buyer Assumed Agreements, will not subject the
Buyer to any liability whatsoever that arises prior to the Closing or by
reason of such transfer under the laws of the United States, any state,
territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, based, in whole
or in part, directly or indirectly, on any theory of law or equity,
including, without limitation, any theory of equitable law, any theory of
antitrust, successor, transferee, derivative, or vicarious liability or any
similar theory and/or applicable state or federal law or otherwise.

  



  

 _Prompt Consummation_

  



  

X. Based on the record of the Sale Hearing, and for the reasons
stated on the record at the Sale Hearing, the sale of the Purchased
Assets must be approved and consummated promptly to preserve the value of the
Purchased Assets. Time, therefore, is of the essence in effectuating the
Purchase Agreement. As such, the Debtors and the Buyer intend to close the
sale of the Purchased Assets as soon as reasonably practicable. The Debtors
have demonstrated compelling circumstances and a good, sufficient, and sound
business purpose and justification for the immediate approval and
consummation of the Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, there is sufficient
cause to waive the stay provided in Bankruptcy Rules 6004(h) and 6006(d).

 _Good Faith of Buyer_

  



  

18. _The Sale contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is undertaken by the Buyer without collusion and in good faith, as that term is defined in section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, and accordingly, the reversal or modification on appeal of the authorization provided herein to consummate the Sale shall not affect the validity of the Sale (including, without limitation, the assumption and assignment of the Buyer Assumed Agreements), unless such authorization and consummation of such Sale are duly and properly stayed pending such appeal._

  



  

19. _Neither the Debtors nor the Buyer have engaged in any action or inaction that would cause or permit the Sale to be avoided or costs or damages to be imposed under section 363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code. The consideration provided by the Buyer for the Purchased Assets under the Purchase Agreement is fair and reasonable and the Sale may not be avoided, and costs and damages may not be imposed, under section 363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code._

  



  

 _Assumption and Assignment of Buyer Assumed Agreements_

  



  

20. _The Debtors are authorized and directed at the Closing to assume and assign each of the Buyer Assumed Agreements to the Buyer pursuant to sections 105(a) and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and to execute and deliver to the Buyer such documents or other instruments as may be necessary to assign and transfer the Buyer Assumed Agreements to the Buyer. The payment by the Buyer of the applicable Cure Costs (if any) under a Buyer Assumed Agreement shall (a) effect a cure of all defaults existing thereunder as of the Closing, and (b) compensate for any actual pecuniary loss to such counterparty resulting from such default._

21. _Pursuant to section 365(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, subject to payment by the Buyer of the applicable Cure Costs, the Buyer Assumed Agreements to be assumed and assigned under the Purchase Agreement shall be assigned and transferred to, and remain in full force and effect for the benefit of, the Buyer notwithstanding any provision in the Buyer Assumed Agreements or other restrictions prohibiting their assignment or transfer. Any provisions in any Buyer Assumed Agreement that prohibit or condition the assignment of such Buyer Assumed Agreement to the Buyer or allow the counterparty to such Buyer Assumed Agreement to terminate, recapture, impose any penalty, condition on renewal or extension, or modify any term or condition upon the assignment of such Buyer Assumed Agreement to the Buyer, constitute unenforceable anti-assignment provisions that are null and void and of no force and effect. All other requirements and conditions under sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code for the assumption by the Debtors and assignment to the Buyer of the Buyer Assumed Agreements have been satisfied. Upon the Closing, in accordance with sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Buyer shall be fully and irrevocably vested with all right, title, and interest of the Debtors under the Buyer Assumed Agreements, and such Buyer Assumed Agreements shall remain in full force and effect for the benefit of the Buyer. Each counterparty to the Buyer Assumed Agreements shall be forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from (a) asserting against the Debtors or any Buyer Party or their respective property any assignment fee, acceleration, default, breach or claim or pecuniary loss, or condition to assignment existing, arising or accruing as of the Closing or arising by reason of the Closing, including, without limitation, any breach related to or arising out of change-in-control provisions in such Buyer Assumed Agreements, or any purported written or oral modification to the Buyer Assumed Agreements and (b) asserting against any Buyer Party (or its respective property, including, without limitation, the Purchased Assets) any claim, counterclaim, defense, breach, condition, or setoff asserted, or assertable against the Debtors existing as of the Closing or arising by reason of the Closing except for the Assumed Liabilities._

WHEREAS, Sellers have certain shared services (as set forth on _Exhibit A_ )
(collectively, the " _Shared Services_ ") which need to be used by one or
both Buyer(s) after the Closing (as defined in the respective Purchase
Agreement to which such Buyer is a party) for the period of time set forth on
_Exhibit A_ with respect to such Shared Service (each, a " _Transition Period_
");

  



    

 | | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

WHEREAS, either or both Buyers may have purchased one or more of the Shared
Services, while the remaining Shared Services, if any, are being retained by
a Seller, for at least the applicable Transition Period;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Parties are entering into this Agreement to facilitate the
delivery and use of the Shared Services, on the terms and subject to the
conditions and limitations set forth herein and on _Exhibit A_ ; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Service Providers (as defined below) have agreed to provide the
Shared Services on a transitional basis to the Service Recipients (as
defined below), all as set forth on _Exhibit A_ , following the Closing (as
defined in the Purchase Agreement to which such Service Recipient is a
party).

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises made herein, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby
agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Shared Services_.

  



  

(a) _General_.

  



  

(i) When a Party is providing, or causing its respective Affiliates
or third-party providers to provide, a Shared Service hereunder, it will be
so identified on _Exhibit A_ and be referred to herein as a " _Service
Provider_ " with respect to the provided Shared Services indicated on
_Exhibit A_. When a Party is receiving a Shared Service hereunder, it will be
so identified on _Exhibit A_ and be referred to herein as a " _Service
Recipient_ " with respect to the received Shared Services indicated on
_Exhibit A_. A Party may be a Service Provider with respect to a given Shared
Service, and may be a Service Recipient with respect to another Shared
Service.

  



  

(ii) The applicable Service Provider shall, or shall cause their
respective Affiliates or third-party providers to, provide the
applicable Service Recipient with the Shared Services for the Transition
Period, all as set forth on _Exhibit A_ with respect to such Shared Service
and on the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth
herein and on _Exhibit A_ , in the case of the Seller(s), consistent with
such Service Provider's past practices and in all events, in a commercially
reasonable manner; it being understood, however, that the Acquired Business
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement to which such Service Recipient is a
Buyer) was operated as a division of Parent and as such, enjoyed certain
rights, benefits and privileges, which may not all be available to such Buyer
as a Buyer of the respective Acquired Business specified in the Purchase
Agreement to which it is a party. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate a
Service Provider, or its respective Affiliates or third-party providers, as
the case may be, to provide to a Service Recipient any service that is
materially different in amount, kind, scope, quality or manner of performance
from the services provided to the applicable Acquired Business prior to the
date of this Agreement. A Buyer shall receive the Shared Services only for
the benefit of the applicable Acquired Business as transferred to such Buyer
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement to which it is a party and not for the
benefit of such Buyer's other businesses or facilities.

  



    

 | -2-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Compensation and Invoicing_. In consideration for a Service
Provider providing the Shared Services, a Service Recipient shall pay to
such Service Provider the service fees described on _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Service Fees_ ") and such Service Recipient shall also pay to such Service
Provider the Additional Third Party Fees (defined below) and the Service Costs
(defined below). A Service Provider shall invoice a Service Recipient each
month for each Shared Service provided to such Service Recipient during the
prior month. Such Service Recipient shall pay the Service Fees, the Service
Costs and any Additional Third Party Fees within [ten (10)] calendar days
after its receipt of the applicable invoice. Such Service Recipient shall pay
all taxes and other fees and charges imposed by any governmental authority
arising in connection with the sale, purchase, performance or use of the
applicable Shared Services. If any amounts payable to a Service Provider
under this Agreement have not been received by the applicable due date, then
such overdue amounts, or unpaid portion thereof, shall bear interest from such
due date at the rate of 2.0% per month (or portion thereof), until received.
On the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement to which a Service
Recipient is a party), such Service Recipient shall pay to the applicable
Service Provider that is to provide a Shared Service to such
Service Recipient, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
in cash as set forth on _Exhibit A_ (the " _Deposit_ "), with respect to such
Shared Service, as an advance for payment of the Service Fees, the Service
Costs and any Additional Third Party Fees. The amount of each monthly invoice
shall be credited against the Deposit until such time as the Deposit has been
fully earned by a Service Provider, after which time, payment of the Service
Fees, the Service Costs and any Additional Third Party Fees shall be made as
provided herein. If upon the earlier of the expiration or termination of this
Agreement, the Deposit exceeds the aggregate amount of the Service Fees, the
Service Costs and any Additional Third Party Fees, in each case, due and
payable by a Service Recipient hereunder with respect to a Shared Service
(such amount, the " _Excess Amount_ "), such Service Recipient shall pay to
the Service Provider providing such Shared Service by wire transfer of
immediately available funds an amount in cash equal to the Excess Amount.

  



  

(c) _Additional Costs to Provide Services_. If any Service Provider
or its Affiliates' third-party providers, including information
technology vendors, (i) increases the fees payable by the Service Provider
under its presently existing contracts with such provider or vendor as a
direct consequence of the execution of this Agreement or the performance of
the Shared Services hereunder or (ii) charges any fee for the transfer or
provision of services provided by it to a Service Recipient, such Service
Recipient shall be responsible for any such increases in fees (but only such
portion which is allocable to the Shared Services rendered hereunder) and/or
transfer fees (collectively, the " _Additional Third Party Fees_ "), and any
such amounts shall be included on the invoices described above. In addition,
a Service Recipient shall pay to a Service Provider that is providing a Shared
Service to such Service Recipient the reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by such Service Provider and its Affiliates in connection with the
performance of the Shared Services hereunder (the " _Service Costs_ "), which
amounts shall also be included on the invoices described above; provided,
that any Shared Services that require technical resource time (e.g., data
extracts from systems, backups of system data, transformation of data,
migration of data, or other technical resources) will be billed on a time and
materials basis at hourly rate of $[●]/hr.

ARTICLE I

  



  

2. _Other Covenants._

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by Service Recipient_. Service Recipient shall
indemnify and hold each Service Provider that is providing Shared Services
to such Service Recipient and its Affiliates and their respective directors,
managers, members, stockholders, officers, employees, controlling persons,
and other representatives harmless from and against all claims, losses,
damages or expenses of whatever form or nature, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and other costs of legal defense (collectively, " _Damages_
"), whether direct or indirect, that they, or any of them, may suffer,
sustain or incur or become subject to, resulting from or arising out of (i)
any of the Shared Services rendered or to be rendered by or on behalf of such

ARTICLE II

  



  

3. _Term; Termination._

  



  

2.1 (a) _Term_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein or on _Exhibit A_ hereto, the term of this Agreement shall commence
upon the entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court approving this Agreement,
Sellers' performance of their obligations hereunder and the Purchase
Agreement to which they are a party, and shall continue in full force and
effect for a period expiring on the expiration of the latest Transition
Period set forth on _Exhibit A_ (the " _Expiration Date_ "), unless the
Parties shall extend such Expiration Date by mutual written agreement of the
Parties.

  



  

2.2 (b) _Early Termination_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of _Section 3(a)_ , the term of this Agreement (or the provision of
one or more of the Shared Services provided under this Agreement, i.e., any
Transition Period referred to in _Exhibit A_ ) may be terminated prior to the
Expiration Date (or prior to the end of the applicable Transition Period) as
follows:

  



    

 | -5-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) by the mutual written agreement of the Sellers and the Buyers to
the extent so provided in such written agreement;

  



  

(ii) by the mutual written agreement of a Service Provider and a
Service Recipient of such Shared Service(s), but only with respect to one or
more of such Shared Service(s);

  



  

(iii) immediately by a Service Provider with respect to one or more of
such Shared Service(s), if a Service Recipient of such Shared
Service(s) breaches any of its obligations or covenants contained in this
Agreement with respect to such Shared Service and does not cure such breach
within five (5) days after receipt of written notice of such breach from such
Service Provider; or

  



  

(iv) by a Service Recipient with respect to one or more of such Shared
Service(s), upon [twenty (20)] days' prior written notice to a Service
Provider providing such Shared Service(s).

  



  

2.3 (c) _Prompt Transition_. During the term of this
Agreement, each Service Provider and each Service Recipient shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (but at no expense to the Service Providers
or any of their respective Affiliates) to cooperate with and assist each
other in connection with the transition from the performance of each Shared
Service by such Service Provider or its Affiliates, as the case may be, to
the performance of such Shared Service by a Service Recipient as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement to which such Service Recipient is a party).

  



  

(d) _Effect of Termination_. Upon termination of any Shared
Service under this Agreement, neither a Service Provider nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to provide such Shared Service to a Service
Recipient that was receiving such Shared Service. Termination of this
Agreement or any Shared Service hereunder shall not affect a Service
Provider's rights to receive Service Fees, Service Costs or any Additional
Third Party Fees payable under _Section 1(b)_ for the Shared Services provided
prior to termination of this Agreement. The termination rights set forth in
_Section 3(b)_ shall be in addition, and without prejudice, to all other
rights and remedies to which the terminating party may be entitled, including
any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The provisions of
_Section 2_ shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement or
any Shared Services hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Service
Provider terminates any Shared Service pursuant to _Section 3(b)(iii)_ , then
a Service Recipient of such Shared Service shall nevertheless be responsible
for all accrued Services Fees and Service Costs with respect to such Shared
Service through the date of termination without reduction, abatement or set-
off of any kind.

  



  

2.4 4. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

2.5 (a) _Independent Contractor Status_. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to make any party the agent of any other party or to
create a partnership or joint venture among the parties for any purpose
whatsoever. Each Party shall at all times retain exclusive management and
control over its officers, employees, policy decisions and business
operations. The employees of a Service Provider and its Affiliates shall not
be considered employees of any Service Recipient or any of its Affiliates for
any purpose.

  



    

 | -6-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.6 (b) _Cooperation of Service Recipients_. With respect
to any Shared Service, a Service Recipient shall cooperate diligently with a
Service Provider and its Affiliates by promptly providing all information
reasonably deemed necessary by such Service Provider and its Affiliates, as
the case may be, for the performance of such Shared Services and by causing
the applicable Acquired Business (as defined in the Purchase Agreement to
which such Service Recipient is a party) to accept such Shared Services in a
manner consistent with the past practices of such Acquired Business. Should a
Service Recipient's failure to supply such information render performance of
any Shared Services unreasonably difficult, a Service Provider or its
Affiliates, as the case may be, providing such Shared Services, upon
reasonable notice, may provide abridged Shared Services or refuse to perform
such Shared Services in each case until such information is provided.

  



  

2.7 (c) _Nonexclusivity of Services_. Nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent or prohibit a Service Provider or any of its
Affiliates from providing any service similar to the Shared Services to its
own businesses or to any other person or entity, including, but not limited
to, another Service Recipient, or prohibit a Service Recipient from obtaining
any services, including, but not limited to, any Shared Services contemplated
hereunder, from third party providers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
provision of such services by a third party shall not relieve a Service
Provider of its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

2.8 (d) _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be
amended, supplemented or changed except by an instrument in writing signed by
the Sellers and the Buyers; _provided_ that, with respect to any
Shared Service, the terms, conditions and limitations set forth on _Exhibit
A_ may be amended, supplemented or changed by an instrument in writing signed
by the Service Provider providing, and the Service Recipient receiving, such
Shared Service. Any Party may waive in writing any obligation owed to it by
any other Party under this Agreement. No waiver of any Party of any default,
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent occurrence.

  



  

2.9 (e) _Successors and Assignment_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its duties under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other Parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that each
Service Provider may assign this Agreement and any or all of its respective
rights or obligations hereunder to its respective Affiliates or any
successors to such Service Provider or any successor to any business or assets
of such Service Provider to which the Shared Services relate without the
applicable Service Recipient's consent. Except as expressly provided in this
_Section 4(e)_ , any assignment or attempted assignment shall be null and
void.

  



  

2.10 (f) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set
forth in this _Section 4(f)_ , this Agreement does not create, and shall not
be construed as creating, any rights enforceable by any person or entity not a
party to this Agreement, except to the extent that such person or entity is
entitled to indemnification provided in _Section 2(a)_  or _Section 2(b)_
hereof.

  



    

 | -7-| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.11 (g)   _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and all matters
arising, directly or indirectly, from it) shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without reference to the conflicts of law principles thereof. Each of the
Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the
Bankruptcy Court and the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York located in New York County (and the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) for the purpose of any proceeding or judgment relating to
or arising out of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any such proceeding. The Parties consent to service of process by mail (in
accordance with Section 8.7 of the Purchase Agreement to which they are a
party) or any other manner permitted by law.

  



  

(h) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including _Exhibit A_
hereto) and the Purchase Agreement to which each Party is a party
supersedes all prior agreements between the Parties with respect to the
Shared Services and constitutes a complete and exclusive statement of the
terms of the agreement between the Parties with respect to the Shared
Services.

  



  

(i) _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that a breach
of the provisions of this Agreement (including _Exhibit A_ hereto) by such
Party will cause irreparable harm to the other Parties to whom
such performance was due, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law
and for which the ascertainment of damages would be difficult. Therefore,
each of the Parties shall be entitled to seek, in addition to, and without
having to prove the inadequacy of, other remedies at law, to specific
performance of this Agreement (including _Exhibit A_ hereto), as well as
injunctive and other equitable relief (without being required to post bond or
other security).

  



  

(j) _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, waivers, consents
and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and delivered to the
address and in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8.7 of
the Purchase Agreement to which they are a party.

  



  

(k) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page by facsimile or electronic means (including a PDF thereof)
shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

GENERAL TERMS

  



  

The Service Provider and its Affiliates are retaining certain employees
primarily for the purpose of performing the Shared Services. Each Service
Recipient is agreeing to pay the compensation and related expenses of those
employees as set forth herein. The Services Fees are a function of that
compensation expense, as well as related overhead and employment tax expense.
Specifically, the Service Fees will consist of the following, with respect to
each employee who performs Shared Services and, in each case, allocable to the
portion of the Transition Period the employee provides Shared Services to the
applicable Service Recipient: (1) the compensation payable during the
applicable Transition Period to such employee for the employee's performance
of Shared Services (with respect to each such employee, the " _Employee
Compensation Expense_ "); (2) the benefit expense incurred with respect to
each such employee during the Transition Period, which will be based upon an
allocation of the overall benefit expense for the benefits received by such
employee, as reasonably determined by the Service Provider (with respect to
each such employee, the " _Allocable Benefit Expense_ "); (3) a reasonable
allocation to such employee of the Service Provider's corporate
headquarters' overhead expense, including without limitation, rent,
utilities, information technology, insurance, and such other general
and administrative expenses historically and reasonably incurred in employing
all of the retained employees (with respect to each such employee, the "
_Allocable Overhead Expense_ "); and (4) all payroll and other taxes payable
by the Service Provider or its Affiliates in respect of each such employee
(other than any taxes based on the income of the Service Provider or its
Affiliates) (with respect to each such employee, the " _Allocable Payroll Tax
Expense_ "). Please refer to _Exhibit B_  of this Agreement for the hourly
rate per employee, which is inclusive of items (1) - (4) referred to above.
Any billing for Shared Services related to the above, shall be in 1/4 (one
quarter) of an hour increments. On Monday of each week, the Service Provider
will send a listing of billable hours by individual for the previous week to
the applicable Service Recipient for their review and approval.
