Buyer shall withhold from the Closing Date Payment an amount equal to 7.5% of
the Closing Date Payment (the " _Escrow Amount_ ) for the purpose of providing

to be delivered to LaSalle Bank, National Association, as escrow agent (the "
_Escrow Agent_ "), pursuant to an escrow agreement by and among Buyer, the

substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit H and as such agreement

Adjustment Escrow Amount to be delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the

terms of Section 3.1 of this Agreement shall be satisfied first by payment
from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, but shall not be limited at
any time to the value of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount. The
Operating Companies and the ESOP Trust acknowledge and agree that to the
extent the amount and application of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount are insufficient to pay and discharge all amounts owing by the
Operating Companies to Buyer pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof, Buyer may pursue
all rights and remedies hereunder, or under applicable law, against the
Operating Companies for such deficiency without resorting to the Escrow
Amount.

purposes of federal and, where applicable, state and local Tax filings,
declarations, returns and reports related to this Agreement, including the
reports required to be filed under Section 1060 of the Code. Buyer shall
prepare and deliver IRS Form 8594 to the Operating Companies within ninety

ARTICLE III 
  _PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS_

 

3.1

 

 _Net Operating Working Capital Adjustments_. 

 

(a)

 

The Operating Companies and Buyer agree that the Operating Companies shall
have Net Operating Working Capital of $12,600,000 on the Closing Date. No
more than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and not less than
two (2) days prior to the Closing, Holdings shall in good faith prepare and
deliver to Buyer a consolidated closing balance sheet of the Operating
Companies as of immediately prior to the Closing (" _Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet_ ") as well as an estimate of Net Operating Working Capital ("
_Estimated Net Operating Working Capital_ "). If the Estimated Net Operating
Working Capital is less than $12,600,000, the Closing Date Payment shall be
reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such difference. If the Estimated
Net Operating Working Capital is greater than $12,600,000, the Closing Date
Payment shall be increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such difference.
The Parties agree to include the difference between Estimated Net Operating
Working Capital and $12,600,000, whether a positive or negative number, in
calculating the portion of the Closing Date Payment payable by Buyer to the
Operating Companies at Closing (the " _Estimated Net Operating Working Capital
Adjustment_ ").

 

(b)

 

Buyer will have a period of sixty (60) days following the Closing to notify
Holdings of any disagreements with the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet,
Estimated Net Operating Working Capital and Estimated Net Operating Working
Capital Adjustment. Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted to
review the working papers related to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet,
Estimated Net Operating Working Capital and Estimated Net Operating Working
Capital Adjustment.

 

(c)

 

Any such notice of disagreement shall be accompanied by supporting
documentation, including a consolidated balance sheet of the Companies on the
Closing Date (the " _Revised Closing Balance Sheet_ "), as well as a
calculation of the adjustments, if any, to be made to the Estimated Net
Operating Working Capital Adjustment (the _Schedule of Adjustments_ ").
Failure to notify Holdings within such 60 day period shall be deemed
acceptance of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, Estimated Net Operating
Working Capital and Estimated Net Operating Working Capital Adjustment. In
the event Buyer timely notifies Holdings of any disagreement, each of the
Operating Companies and Buyer agrees that it will attempt in good faith to
resolve such disagreement. Holdings and its representatives shall be
permitted to review the working papers related to BuyerÂ’s calculation of the
Revised Closing Balance Sheet and Schedule of Adjustments.

 

(d)

 

If within 45 days after delivery to Holdings and the ESOP Trust of the
notification by Buyer of a disagreement, the Parties are unable to resolve
such disagreement, either Holdings, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other
hand, shall have the right to submit the determination of such matters to an
independent accountant of national standing, to be selected by Holdings and
Buyer in good faith within ten (10) additional days after delivery of the
notice of disagreement (the " _Independent Auditor_ "), whose decision shall
be delivered to Buyer and the Operating Companies within sixty (60) days of
the submission to the Independent Auditor and shall be binding on the parties.
The cost of the Independent Auditor shall be paid by the

 


  

 

18

  

 



 

party whose aggregate estimate of the disputed amount or amounts, as the case
may be, differs most greatly from the determination of the Independent
Auditor. 

 

(e)

 

If it is determined pursuant to this Section 3.1 that the Estimated Net
Operating Working Capital Adjustment paid at the Closing is greater than the
additional net operating working capital adjustment as determined pursuant to
Section 3.1 (b), (c) and (d) above (the " _Additional Net Operating Working
Capital Adjustment_ "), the Operating Companies shall be required to remit
such difference to Buyer in cash, with the amount of such difference being
paid from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount to the extent available,
and thereafter directly from the Operating Companies. If it is determined
pursuant to this Section 3.1 that the Estimated Net Operating Working Capital
Adjustment paid at the Closing is less than the Estimated Net Operating
Working Capital Adjustment as determined pursuant to this Section 3.1, Buyer
shall remit such difference in cash to the Operating Companies.

 

(f)

 

Any cash payment to be made as a result of adjustments made in accordance with
Section 3.1 shall be paid within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination of such adjustments by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. Any such payment shall be made to such account or accounts as may be
designated by Buyer or the Operating Companies, as the case may be, at least
two (2) Business Days prior to the date that such payment is to be made.

 

(g)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, BuyerÂ’s right to
audit and adjust the Closing Date Payment shall be limited solely to the audit
and adjustment, if any, of the Net Operating Working Capital and Estimated Net
Operating Working Capital Adjustment and the Additional Net Operating Working
Capital Adjustment as of the Closing Date.

 

3.2

 

 _Earn-Out Payments_. The Purchase Price shall be increased by: (1) an amount
equal to 1.5 multiplied by every $1.00 of Adjusted EBITDA for the year ending
December 31, 2008 in excess of $10,000,000 (the " _2008 Earn-Out Payment_ ")
_plus_ (2) an amount equal to 2.37 multiplied by every $1.00 of Adjusted
EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2009 in excess of $10,000,000 (the "
_2009 Earn-Out Payment_ " and together with the 2008 Earn-Out Payment, the "
_Earn-Out Payments_ "). For clarification, there can be no assurance that the
Earn-Out Payments will be earned. The Earn-Out Payments, if any, shall be
paid only if actually earned pursuant to this Section 3.2 and Section 3.3
hereof.

 

3.3

 

 _Calculation of Earn-Out Payments_. The determination of the Earn-out
Payments, if any, to be paid pursuant to Section 3.2 shall be made pursuant to
the following provisions:

 

(a)

 

No later than March 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010, respectively, Buyer shall in
good faith prepare or cause to be prepared and shall deliver to Holdings and
the ESOP Trust a calculation of EBITDA for the years ending December 31, 2008
and December 31, 2009, respectively, as well as a calculation of the Adjusted
EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009,
respectively (for each year, the " _EBITDA Calculations_ "). Holdings, the
ESOP Trust and their respective representatives shall be permitted to review
the

 


  

 

19

  

 



 

working papers of Buyer and of its certified public accountants related to the
EBITDA Calculations, and shall have access during normal business hours upon
reasonable notice to all relevant books and records and employees of the
Business in order to review the calculation of the EBITDA Calculations.

 

(b)

 

Holdings and the ESOP Trust will have a period of sixty days (60) following
the delivery of the EBITDA Calculations for the years ending December 31, 2008
and December 31, 2009, as the case may be, to notify Buyer of any
disagreements with such EBITDA Calculations. Any such notice shall be
accompanied by supporting documentation containing reasonable detail. Failure
to notify Buyer within such 60-day period shall be deemed acceptance of such
EBITDA Calculations. In the event Holdings and/or the ESOP Trust timely
notifies Buyer of any disagreement, each of Holdings, the ESOP Trust and the
Buyer agrees that it will attempt in good faith to resolve such disagreement.
If within sixty (60) days after delivery to Buyer of the notification by
Holdings and/or the ESOP Trust of a disagreement, the parties are unable to
resolve such disagreement, either Holdings and/or the ESOP Trust, on the one
hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, shall have the right to submit the
determination of such matters to the Independent Auditor whose decision shall
be delivered to Buyer, Holdings and the ESOP Trust within sixty (60) days of
the submission to the Independent Auditor and shall be binding on the parties.
The cost of the Independent Auditor shall be paid by the party whose aggregate
estimate of the disputed amount or amounts, as the case may be, differs most
greatly from the determination of the Independent Auditor.

 

(c)

 



 

Any cash payment to be made pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be paid within five
(5) Business Days of the final determination of such amount by wire transfer
of immediately available funds. Any such payment shall be made to such
account or accounts as may be designated by Holdings at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the date that such payment is to be made.

 

(d)

 



 

For the purpose of calculating Adjusted EBITDA to determine the Earn-Out
Payments, (i) there shall not be any allocation of corporate overhead to the
Business without the prior written consent of Holdings (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) other than for items required to bring the
Company into compliance with applicable laws; (ii) there shall not be any
allocation of expenses in connection with BuyerÂ’s compliance with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder; (iii) the expenses related to insurance coverage of the Business
provided under the BuyerÂ’s insurance programs shall not exceed the actual
costs for such benefits in 2007 except for inflationary cost increases; (iv)
with respect to calculating the matching component expense for the 401(k)
plan, the Business shall recognize an amount equal to the annualized 2008
matching component expense of the 401(k) Component, plus 50% of the
incremental annualized expense, if any, incurred by Buyer during the
respective fiscal year relating to the matching component of the 401(k)
Component for employees of the Business after the Closing; (v) there shall not
be any allocation of expenses incurred by any party in connection with this
Agreement, including independent auditor fees pursuant to Section 3.1,
attorneysÂ’ fees or similar expenses, provided, however, that this clause (v)
shall not apply to the liabilities of any underlying claims; (vi) except with

be any allocation of expenses in connection with any severance payment or
termination payment to Jim Ginter, Anne Anderson or Michael Pretiger pursuant
to any Employment Agreement with Buyer; and (viii) any amounts excluded from

9.2 hereof shall be excluded from the calculation of Earn-Out Payments.

Buyer will have a period of sixty (60) days following the Closing to notify
Holdings of any disagreements with the Nearest Jamestown Balance Sheet and
Estimated Excess Cash. Buyer and its representatives shall be permitted to
review the working papers of Global Captive Management, Ltd. related to the
Nearest Jamestown Balance Sheet and Estimated Excess Cash.

 

(c)

 

Any such notice of disagreement shall be accompanied by supporting
documentation, including the Nearest Jamestown Balance Sheet and a schedule of
adjustments (the " _Jamestown Adjustment Schedule_ "), setting forth a
calculation of the adjustments, if any, to be made to the nearest Jamestown
Balance Sheet and the calculation of Estimated Excess Cash. Failure to notify
Holdings within such 60 day period shall be deemed acceptance of the Nearest
Jamestown Balance Sheet and Estimated Excess Cash. In the event Buyer timely
notifies Holdings of any disagreement, each of Holdings and Buyer agrees that
it will attempt in good faith to resolve such disagreement. Holdings and its
representatives shall be permitted to review the working papers related to

greatly from the determination of the Independent Auditor.

status as an "employee stock ownership plan" under Sections 409 and 4975(e)(7)
of the Code, and nothing has occurred, whether by action or by failure to act,
that caused or could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such status

transaction.

 

(e)

 

No proceeding has been threatened, asserted, instituted or, to the Knowledge
of the Companies, is anticipated against any of the Plans (other than non-

retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or
contingent liabilities arising wholly or partially out of events occurring on
or before the Closing Date.

 

(g)

 

Except as set forth on Schedule 4.19(g) of the Disclosure Schedule, the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions alone, or in combination with
any other event, including a termination of any Employee, director,
stockholder or other service provider of the Business (whether current, former

any Plan, including, without limitation, liability for severance pay,
unemployment compensation, termination pay or withdrawal liability, or
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due to any Employee, director, stockholder or other
service provider of the Business (whether current, former or retired) or their

performs or performed services for the Business in any capacity being
improperly excluded from participating in a Plan. Each employee of the
Business has been properly classified as "exempt" or "non-exempt" under

inaccurate by such events and circumstances; _provided_ , _however_ , if such
Operating CompanyÂ’s or ESOP TrustÂ’s supplementation or amendment of a Schedule
based upon events or circumstances that occur between the date of this

employer shall provide Forms W-2 to such employees reflecting all wages paid

 _Employment_. 

 

(a)

 

Buyer will make offers of employment to all employees of the Companies other
than the employees listed on Schedule 7.11 of the Disclosure Schedule having
substantially similar compensation terms (salary and bonus) that they received
as of immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
offers of employment shall be contingent on the Closing actually occurring.
Buyer will also provide benefits to such employees who commence employment
with Buyer which, when taken as a whole, are substantially the same as the
benefits provided by the Companies to such employees immediately prior to the
Closing, other than benefits attributable to the ESOP. Transferred Employees
will receive full credit for their service with the Operating Companies prior
to the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility and, to the extent applicable,
vesting, under BuyerÂ’s Employee Benefit Plans, solely to the extent past
service was recognized and properly accrued for such Transferred Employees
under the comparable Plans immediately prior to the Closing, and to the extent
past service is credited under such Plans for similarly situated Employees of
Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.11 shall be
construed to require crediting of service that would result in (i) duplication
of benefits, (ii) service credit for benefit accruals under any Employee
Benefit Plan, or (iii) service credit under a newly established plan for which
prior service is not taken into account for employees of Buyer and its
subsidiaries generally. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
be construed as to prevent Buyer from terminating the employment of any
Transferred Employee at any time after the Closing Date for any reason (or no
reason), except as otherwise set forth in a written employment agreement
executed by Buyer and such Employee. The Companies shall deliver to Buyer as
of the Closing Date all personnel files relating to any Employee who becomes
an employee of Buyer.

 

(b)

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.11 to the contrary, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment
or other modification of any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, or shall limit the right of Buyer to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates following the Closing Date. If (i) a party other than the parties
hereto makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any provision in this
Agreement as an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to
such Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates even
though not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement, then, solely with
respect to the Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates at issue, such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have
no amendatory effect with respect thereto.

 

(c)

 

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 7.11 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and that
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third
party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including, without
limitation, any Employee who becomes an employee of Buyer, any participant in
any Employee Benefit Plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Buyer
or any of its Affiliates.

the Operating Companies or any of their Affiliates receives any inquiries or
orders from customers or prospects relating to the Business or, if the
Operating Companies or any of their Affiliates receives any solicitations
relating to the Business from customers or prospects, the Operating Companies

mail, of the Disclosure Statement and the letter of transmittal to all of the
ESOP participants and shall provide Buyer and the ESOP Trustee with a copy of
these materials. The ESOP participants shall have 30 calendar days to return

nor any of their officers, directors, Employees, agents or consultants shall
interfere or attempt to interfere with or influence or attempt to influence
any ESOP participant with respect to his or her decision with respect to
voting instructions. Except to the extent required by applicable law, all
individual voting instructions shall remain strictly confidential and shall
not be disclosed to any Person. Unless otherwise required by ERISA, the ESOP

Company or the ESOP Trust contained in this Agreement or any Operative
Document; and (iii) any liability of or relating to the ESOP Trust or the
Companies other than Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, but subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.2:
(A) No Company shall be required to indemnify a Buyer Claimant under clause
(i) of this Section 9.2 unless the aggregate cumulative sum of all Claims for
which indemnity would otherwise be due under clause (i) of this Section 9.2
exceeds $1,500,000 (the _Deductible_ "), and then only for the amount by which
the aggregate cumulative sum of all Claims exceeds $1,500,000, (B) the
CompaniesÂ’ aggregate maximum liability for any and all Claims by Buyer in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, including indemnification under
this Section 9.2, shall not exceed the Escrow Amount available at any time
under the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall be released as and to the
extent provided in the Escrow Agreement. The limitations set forth in
foregoing clauses (A) and (B) shall not apply to Claims arising from any
inaccuracy or breach of the representations or warranties contained in Section
4.3(b) and the last sentence of Section 4.9(a). The Buyer Claimants shall not
be entitled to count against the Deductible or seek indemnification for Claims
to the extent that the items giving rise to such Claims were used in
calculating the Earn-Out Payments pursuant to Sections 3.2 and 3.3 above and,
to the extent that any items or amounts have been applied against the
Deductible or subject to a Claim for indemnification by the Buyer Claimants
(whether or not the Buyer Claimants have prevailed on such application against
the Deductible or Claim for indemnification), such amounts may not be used in
calculating the Earn-Out Payments, it being the intent of the parties that
Buyer shall have the right to elect one remedy only (indemnity or an Earn-Out
Payment adjustment) with respect to any such item or amount.

 

9.3

 

 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold the ESOP Trust
and each Company and its respective directors, officers, employees,
shareholders, members, partners, agents, Affiliates, successors and assigns
(collectively " _Seller Claimants_ " and individually " _Seller Claimant_ ")
harmless from and defend each of them from and against any and all Claims
asserted against, imposed upon or incurred by the Seller Claimants resulting
from or arising out of (i) any alleged inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any
Operative Document, or any claim by a third party which, if true, would
constitute such inaccuracy or breach; (ii) any breach of any covenant or
obligation of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any Operative Document;
(iii) any Assumed Liability; (iv) the operation of the Business or ownership
of the Purchased Assets on or after the Closing Date; and/or (v) a 953(d) tax
election by Buyer after the Closing Date regarding Jamestown that negatively
impacts Holdings tax liabilities incurred prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary; (A) Buyer shall not
be required to indemnify a Seller Claimant under clause (i) of the first
sentence of this Section 9.3 unless the aggregate cumulative sum of all Claims
for which indemnity would otherwise be due under clause (i) of the first
sentence of this Section 9.3 exceeds $1,500,000, and then only for the amount
by which the aggregate cumulative sum of all Claims exceeds $1,500,000, and
(B) in addition, BuyerÂ’s aggregate maximum liability for indemnification under
clause (i) of the first

 


  

 

63

  

 



 

sentence of this Section 9.3 shall not exceed the Escrow Amount available at
any time under the Escrow Agreement.

 

9.4

 

 _Terms and Conditions of Indemnification_. The respective obligations and
liabilities of the Operating Companies and Buyer to indemnify pursuant to this
ARTICLE IX shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

 

(a)

 

The party seeking indemnification (the " _Claimant_ ") must give the other
party or parties, as the case may be (the " _Indemnitor_ "), prompt written
notice of any such Claim. The ClaimantÂ’s failure to give prompt notice,
however, shall not serve to eliminate or limit the ClaimantÂ’s right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the rights of the Indemnitor.

 

(b)

 

The respective obligations and liabilities of the Companies and Buyer to
indemnify pursuant to this ARTICLE IX in respect of any Claim by a third party
shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions:

 

(i)

 

The Indemnitor shall have the right to undertake, by counsel or other
representatives of its own choosing reasonably satisfactory to Claimant, the
defense, compromise, and settlement of such Claim.

 

(ii)

 

In the event that the Indemnitor shall elect not to undertake such defense, or
within ten (10) days after notice of any such Claim from the Claimant shall
fail to defend, the Claimant shall have the right to undertake the defense,
compromise or settlement of such Claim, by counsel or other representatives of
its own choosing, on behalf of and for the account and risk of the Indemnitor.

 

(iii)

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.4 to the contrary, (A) if there is
a reasonable probability that a Claim may materially and adversely affect the
Claimant other than as a result of money damages or other money payments, the
Claimant shall have the right, to participate in the defense, compromise or
settlement of the Claim, (B) the Indemnitor shall not, without the ClaimantÂ’s
written consent, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to entry of any
judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claiming party or the plaintiff to the Claimant of a release from all
liability in respect of such Claim, and (C) in the event that the Indemnitor
undertakes defense of any Claim, the Claimant by counsel or other
representative of its own choosing and at its sole cost and expense, shall
have the right to consult with the Indemnitor and its counsel or other
representatives concerning such Claim and the Indemnitor and the Claimant and
their respective counsel or other representatives shall cooperate with respect
to such Claim, subject to the execution and delivery of a mutually
satisfactory joint defense agreement. 

 

(c)

 

If a Claimant incurs a tax liability as a result of the receipt of an
indemnification payment under this ARTICLE IX, the Indemnitor shall indemnify
the Claimant for that tax liability and for any tax liability incurred by the
Claimant with respect to a payment pursuant to this sentence.

 


  

 

64

  

 



 

(d)

 

Any payment made in respect of indemnification under this ARTICLE IX shall be
treated for all purposes, and shall constitute, an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

 

(e)

 

BUYER AND COMPANIES AGREE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL ANY PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS BE
RESPONSIBLE (AS A RESULT OF INDEMNITY CLAIM OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY PUNITIVE
CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OPERATIVE
DOCUMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS LIABLE FOR SUCH DAMAGES TO ANY THIRD PARTY
(EXCLUDING ANY AFFILIATE OF A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT).

 

(f)

 

 _Third Party Contribution_. The amount of any and all Claims for which
indemnification is provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by any
amounts actually received by the Claimant under insurance policies in effect
relating to such Claims. In the event that any claim for indemnification
asserted under this Agreement is, or may be, the subject of insurance coverage
of Buyer or any Company or other right to indemnification or contribution from
any third party (a " _Third Party Contributor_ "), each of the Claimant and
Indemnitor shall promptly notify the applicable insurance carrier of such
claim and shall also promptly notify any potential Third Party Contributor.
Claimant and Indemnitor shall pursue, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnitor, such claims diligently and shall reasonably cooperate, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnitor, with each such insurance carrier and Third
Party Contributor.

 

(g)

 

 _Tax Benefits/Costs_. The amount of any and all Claims for which
indemnification is provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be (i) increased
to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the Claimant arising from the
receipt of indemnity payments hereunder, and (ii) reduced to take account of
any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Claimant arising from the
incurrence or payment of any such Claims; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
net Tax cost incurred and any net Tax benefit realized shall be attributable
to those Claims taken into account on a Tax return for a year not later than
the year in which the indemnity payment is made. In computing the amount of
any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Claimant shall be deemed to recognize
all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing
any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the
incurrence or payment of any and all Claims.

 

(h)

 

 _Claim Against Escrow_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in the
last sentence of Section 9.2(a) as to Claims against the Operating Companies
arising from any inaccuracy or breach of the representations or warranties
contained in Section 4.3(b) and the last sentence of Section 4.9(a), and
except for Claims under Sections 2.9, 3.1(e), 3.4 and 7.24, any Claims to
which Buyer may be entitled to indemnification under or in connection with
this Agreement shall be satisfied solely and exclusively out of the Escrow
Amount available under the Escrow Agreement and Buyer hereby waives any right
to recoup such Claims from any Company or the ESOP Trust.

 

(i)

 

 _Exclusive Remedy_. Upon and after the Closing, the provisions of ARTICLE IX
of this Agreement represent the sole and exclusive remedy available to any
party

 


  

 

65

  

 



 

to this Agreement for any breach, misstatement or omission by any other party
relating to any representation or warranty contained herein or a certificate
delivered hereunder or for any breach by any other party of any covenant or
agreement required to be performed contained herein or under a certificate
delivered hereunder and with respect to any claim for indemnification or
Claims against any other party hereto and, except with respect to Claims as a
result of fraud (which are expressly not waived), each party hereby
unconditionally waives any other rights that it may have at law or in equity
for any misstatement or omission by any other party from any representation or
warranty contained herein or a certificate delivered hereunder or for any
breach by any other party of any covenant or agreement required to be
performed prior to the Closing contained herein or under a certificate
delivered hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, "fraud" shall be defined
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

 

9.5

 

 _Qualifications_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, for purposes of the indemnification provisions in this ARTICLE IX,
the determination of (i) whether any representation warranty or covenant has
been breached and (ii) the amount of any damages shall be made without giving
effect to any "Material Adverse Effect" qualification or any materiality or
similar qualification contained in the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements herein. Solely with respect to Claims arising as a result of a
breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.14(d),
BuyerÂ’s remedies shall be limited to actual out-of-pocket damages.

 

ARTICLE X 
  _TAX MATTERS_

 

10.1

 

 _Tax Payments_.

 

(a)

 

The Operating Companies shall pay all Taxes payable with respect to the
operation of the Companies for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date or the portion of a period up to the Closing Date that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date, including all Taxes (i) imposed on or payable by
the Companies with respect to any taxable period or portion thereof that ends
on or before the Closing Date, (ii) imposed on or payable by the Companies
under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6 (or any similar state, local or foreign
law) by reason of the Companies having been included in any consolidated,
affiliated, consolidated or unitary group, and (iii) relating to any payments
required to be made after the Closing Date under any Tax indemnity, Tax
sharing or Tax allocation agreement (whether or not in writing) entered into
prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b)

 

To the extent not otherwise provided for under applicable law, Taxes
attributable to the taxable year or period of the Companies beginning on or
before and ending after the Closing Date, shall be apportioned to the period
ending on the Closing Date and to the period beginning on the day after the
Closing Date by means of a closing of the books and records of such Companies
as of the close of business on the Closing Date. To the extent not
susceptible to such allocation, then Taxes shall be apportioned on the basis
of elapsed days unless such Tax is transaction-based, in which case such Tax
shall be apportioned to the period in which the related transaction
occurred/occurs.

 


  

 

66

  

 



 

(c)

 

Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all
Tax Returns for Jamestown for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date which are filed after the Closing Date. A reasonable time before any
such Tax Return is due to be filed, Buyer shall provide a draft to Holdings.
If Holdings disagrees with any item on the return, Buyer and Holdings shall
confer and seek to reach agreement, and, if they cannot agree, the matter
shall be referred to an Independent Auditor, and the decision of the
Independent Auditor shall be final and binding on Buyer and Holdings. The
cost of the Independent Auditor shall be paid by the party whose aggregate
estimate of the disputed amount or amounts, as the case may be, differs most
greatly from the determination of the Independent Auditor.

 

(d)

 

Buyer and Holdings shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partyÂ’s request
and at the expense of the requesting party) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation, or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Buyer and Holdings agree (A) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to Holdings relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Holdings, any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all reasonable
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to
give the other party reasonable written notice prior to destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests.
Jamestown shall allow Holdings to take possession of such books and records.
Buyer and Holdings further agree, upon request, to use Reasonable Efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any
other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby).

 

(e)

 

All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with this Agreement shall be paid 50% by the Operating Companies and 50% by
Buyer when due, and Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees.

 

10.2

 

 _Audits_.

 

(a)

 

Except as otherwise provided in this ARTICLE X, with respect to any issue that
may affect the Tax liabilities of any Company for taxable periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, each of Buyer and the Operating Companies shall
promptly notify the other in writing within ten (10) Business Days from its
receipt of notice of (i) any pending Tax audits or assessments of any Company,
and (ii) any pending Tax audits or assessments of any Company or the ESOP
Trust relating to any Company.

 

(b)

 

The Operating Companies shall have the right to represent the interests of any
Company in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding to the extent
relating to Taxes pertaining to periods preceding the Closing Date, and to
employ counsel (reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) of their choice at the
expense of the Operating Companies, provided that

 


  

 

67

  

 



 

the Operating Companies shall (i) provide Buyer with all notices from, and
correspondences with, any taxing authority, keep Buyer informed and consult
with Buyer with respect to any issue relating to such audit or proceeding and
permit Buyer to participate therein, and (ii) take no action that may have an
adverse effect on the Tax liability of Buyer pertaining to periods following
the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Buyer (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
Buyer shall have the right to represent the interests of any Company in any
Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding for which the Operating
Companies fail or elect not to represent the interests of such Company, and to
employ counsel of their choice at the Operating CompaniesÂ’ expense. Buyer and
the Operating Companies shall cooperate, and Buyer shall cause the Companies
to cooperate with the Operating Companies with respect to any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxes referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 10.2(b); provided that the party requesting said
assistance shall pay any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by the party providing such assistance.

of such condition to be satisfied is not caused by a breach hereof by the
terminating party; or

 

(c)

 

any time after October 17, 2008 by Holdings, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, upon notification to the non-terminating party by the

date and such failure to consummate is not caused by a breach of this
Agreement by the terminating party.

 

11.2

 

 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 11.1, this Agreement will forthwith become null and void, and there
will be no liability or obligation on the part of any party (or any of their

representatives or Affiliates), except as provided in the next succeeding
sentence with respect to liability of the Companies, and except that the
provisions with respect to expenses in Section 11.3 and public and private
announcements in Section 11.14 will continue to apply following any such
termination. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(b) or
Section 11.1(c), the Companies will remain liable to Buyer for any breach of
this Agreement by any

No waiver of any such breach or failure or of any term or condition of this
Agreement shall be effective unless in a written notice signed by the waiving

fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which he or it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue in any such court or that any such
proceeding which is brought in accordance with this Section has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. Subject to applicable law, process in any such
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Nothing herein shall affect the
right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law

agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
