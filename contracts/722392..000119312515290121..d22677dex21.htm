the rights of the Financing Source under the Bank Letter (or, if applicable, any Replacement Letter). Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that (x)&nbsp;either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y)&nbsp;an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this <U>Section&nbsp;9.10</U> are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, under no
