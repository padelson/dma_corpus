licensed, with or without receipt of payment, as a result of Seller's or its
Subsidiaries' participation in various Special Interest Groups (SIGs),
Standard Definition Organizations (SDOs) and similar organizations which may
impose obligations to non-exclusively license the Transferred Intellectual
Property to third parties. To the extent that Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries is required to ensure that successors with respect to the

shall assume such obligations as of the Closing.

. Buyer and Seller expressly understand and agree that all assets of Seller
and its Subsidiaries, other than the Transferred Assets (the "Excluded
Assets"), shall be excluded from the Transferred Assets, including, but not

(k) all rights, properties, and assets which have been used in the Business

licensed or otherwise disposed of (either prior to the date hereof or in the

Subsidiaries, including all sales management, engineering, materials,
business planning, manufacturing, logistics, finance and accounting systems
utilized by the Business;

at the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume, and shall pay, perform, fulfill
and discharge, the following Liabilities of Seller or its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Assumed Liabilities"):

 

 

(a) all Liabilities accruing from, arising out of or related to the
Transferred Contracts that are incurred or required to be paid, performed or
otherwise discharged on or after the Effective Time;

 

 

(b) all Liabilities accruing from, arising out of or related to Buyer's
operation of the Business and the ownership and operation of the Transferred
Assets on or after the Effective Time;

 

 

(c) all Liabilities that are assumed by operation of Applicable Law related
to the Transferred Employees whose primary place of employment is outside the
United States, including those specified in Schedule 2.03(c); 

 

 

(d) all Product Obligations;

 

 

(e) any Taxes to be paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.09; and

 

 

(f) all Liabilities to be performed by Buyer or its Subsidiaries under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 

 

The assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities and the transfer of the
Assumed Liabilities by Seller and its Subsidiaries shall in no way expand the
rights or remedies of any Person against Buyer or Seller and its Subsidiaries
or their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders and advisors
as compared to the rights and remedies that such Person would have had
against such Parties had Buyer not assumed the Assumed Liabilities. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the assumption by Buyer of the
Assumed Liabilities shall not create any third-party beneficiary rights.

 

 

2.04 Excluded Liabilities

 

 

. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (and
without implication that Buyer is assuming any Liability of Seller not
expressly listed in Section 2.03), except for those Liabilities expressly
assumed by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.03 and Section 5.09, Buyer shall not
assume and shall not be liable for, and Seller shall retain and remain, as
between Seller and Buyer, solely liable for and obligated to pay, perform or
discharge, all Liabilities of Seller and its Subsidiaries not included in the
Assumed Liabilities (the "Excluded Liabilities"), including the following:

 

 

(a) all Liabilities accruing from, arising out of or related to the
Transferred Contracts that are incurred or required to be paid, performed or
otherwise discharged prior to the Effective Time and all Liabilities for
breaches by Seller or its Subsidiaries of the Transferred Contracts prior to
the Effective Time;

 

 

(b) all Pre-Closing Product Obligations;

 

 

(c) all Liabilities for income Taxes, franchise Taxes or other Taxes based on
income, revenue, gross receipts, capital or net worth, and all Liabilities
for other Taxes not specifically provided for in Section 5.09 to the extent
such other Taxes arise from or relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period;

 

 

(d) all Seller Accounts Payable;

 

 

(e) except as set forth in Section 2.03(c), any Liabilities under Employee
Plans and Employee Agreements;

 

 

(f) all Liabilities accruing or arising from any Proceeding to the extent it
is based on the operation or ownership by Seller or its Subsidiaries of the

failure to comply with Applicable Laws with respect to the Business or the

money borrowed (including capital leases and guarantees) of Seller or any of

2.05 Assignment of Contracts and Rights.

 

 

(a) Anything in this Agreement or any other Acquisition Document to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
assign any Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof, without
the consent of a party thereto or the receipt of any Government Approvals or
the satisfaction of any other requirement thereof or applicable thereto,
would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or in any way
adversely affect the rights of Buyer, Seller or any of Seller's Subsidiaries
thereunder. Seller and Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts (but
without any payment of money by Seller or Buyer) to obtain the consent of the
other parties to any such Transferred Asset or to obtain any claim or right
or any benefit arising thereunder for the assignment thereof to Buyer as
Buyer may reasonably request; provided, however, that Seller shall have no
obligation to assign or transfer any licenses of any Intellectual Property or
any licenses granted by Seller in connection with the sale, distribution and
license of the Products in the ordinary course of business that are not
Transferred Contracts. If such consent or Government Approval is not
obtained, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or would
adversely affect the rights of Seller or any of Seller's
Subsidiaries thereunder prior to the Closing or Buyer thereunder on or after
the Closing so that Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, Seller
and Buyer will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which
Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder from
and after the Effective Time in accordance with this Agreement, including
sub-contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer, or under which
Seller would enforce for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer assuming Seller's
obligations, any and all rights of Seller against a third party thereto.

 

 

(b) No other rights are granted hereunder, by implication, estoppel, statute
or otherwise, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or in any other
Acquisition Document.

 

 

2.06 Consideration

 

 

.

 

 

(a) The aggregate consideration (collectively, the "Consideration") payable
by Buyer to Seller for the Transferred Assets shall be:

 

 

       

(i)

    |  

3,700,000  shares of Buyer Common Stock (the "Share  Consideration"); and

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(ii)

    |  

the  assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Buyer;  and

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(iii)

    |  

the  Additional Payment, if any, set forth in Section  2.09.

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

(b) If there is a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into capital stock),
reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock occurring after the date
of this Agreement and before the Effective Time, all references in this
Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class or series affected
thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of
shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefore) affected thereby,
shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like change. No
fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock will be issued in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and in lieu thereof Seller
shall receive from Buyer an amount of cash equal to such fraction of a share
multiplied by the Buyer Common Stock Price.

 

 

2.07 Closing

 

 

. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Transferred Assets hereunder
(the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher
LLP, 1881 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304 on April 18, 2008 or at
such other time and place or in such manner as the Parties may agree. At the
Closing:

 

 

(a) Seller shall deliver to Buyer the Bill of Sale and, simultaneously with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller, through
its officers, agents and employees, will put Buyer into possession of all
tangible Transferred Assets at the facilities where they are located as of
the Closing Date;

 

 

(b) Seller and Buyer each shall execute and deliver the other Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party;

 

 

(c) Buyer shall deliver to Seller certificates representing the shares of
Buyer Common Stock delivered as Share Consideration;

 

 

(d) Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver a delivery protocol relating
to the manner for delivery of any software that is a Transferred Asset;

 

 

(e) Seller shall deliver to Buyer a certificate of the secretary or an
assistant secretary of Seller attaching and certifying (i) the certificate of
incorporation and Bylaws of Seller as then in effect, (ii) the resolutions of
the Board of Directors of Seller delegating authority to certain authorized
officers to approve the transactions contemplated hereby; and

 

 

(f) Buyer shall deliver to Seller a certificate of the secretary of Buyer
attaching and certifying (i) the certificate of incorporation and Bylaws of
Seller as then in effect, (ii) the resolutions of the Board of Directors of
Buyer approving the transactions contemplated hereby, including the issuance
of the shares of Buyer Common Stock issued as Consideration.

 

 

2.08 Accounting

 

 

(a) . From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall have the right and
authority to collect for its own account all items that are included in the
Transferred Assets.

 

 

2.09 Payment of Additional Payment

 

 

.

 

 

(a) If the Average Buyer Trading Price, as determined on the date that is the
one year anniversary of the Closing Date (or if such day is not a trading
day, the first trading day thereafter) (the "Determination Date"), is less
than $9.46, Buyer shall pay to Seller a payment equal to (A) $9.46 minus the
Average Buyer Trading Price determined as of the Determination
Date multiplied by (B) 3,700,000 (the "Additional Payment"). At Buyer\'s
option, Buyer may pay the Additional Payment by delivering cash or shares of
Buyer Common Stock, or a combination thereof. Any shares of Buyer Common
Stock delivered as part of the Additional Payment shall be valued at the
Average Buyer Trading Price determined as of the Determination Date. The
amount of the Additional Payment may be subject to adjustment pursuant to
clause 2.09(b), but in no event shall the Additional Payment be reduced below
zero (i.e., in no event shall Seller owe Buyer any payment of any kind
pursuant to this Section 2.09). In no event shall the Additional Payment
exceed (i) if paid in shares of Buyer Common Stock, 1,300,000 shares of Buyer
Common Stock, or (ii) if paid in cash, an amount equal to 1,300,000 shares of
Buyer Common Stock multiplied by the Average Buyer Trading Price. If
1,000,000 or more shares of Buyer Common Stock are to be delivered by Buyer
as part of the Additional Payment, such shares must be freely tradable by
Seller immediately upon receipt by Seller.

 

 

(b) If, prior to the Determination Date, Seller has sold any of the Share
Consideration at a price per share equal to or greater than $9.46, then the
Additional Payment will be reduced by an amount equal to the number of shares
of Share Consideration so sold by Seller multiplied by the price per share at
which such shares were sold. If, prior to the Determination Date, Seller has
sold any of the Share Consideration at a price per share lower than $9.46,
then the Additional Payment will be reduced by an amount equal to the number
of shares of Share Consideration so sold by Seller multiplied by $9.46. The
parties acknowledge that Buyer paid shares of Buyer Common Stock as Stock
Consideration pursuant to the Lassen Asset Purchase Agreement and that sale
of such Stock Consideration shall not reduce any Additional Payment. For
the avoidance of doubt, any sale of shares of Buyer Common Stock by Seller
shall be deemed to be a sale of the Stock Consideration paid to Seller
pursuant to the Lassen Purchase Agreement until such time as all of such
Stock Consideration has been sold, and no sale of such Stock Consideration
shall reduce the Additional Payment.

 

 

(c) The "Average Buyer Trading Price" shall be the volume weighted average
price of the Buyer Common Stock (as reported, absent manifest error, on
Nasdaq.com) for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on and including the
trading day that is the Determination Date.

 

 

(d) On the Business Day before the Determination Date, Seller shall notify
Buyer whether it has sold any Share Consideration prior to such date, and if
so, at what price per share.

 

 

(e) By 4:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the Determination Date, Buyer shall notify
Seller whether it intends to deliver any Additional Payment due in cash or
shares of Buyer Common Stock, or a combination thereof. On the fifth Business
Day following the Determination Date, if the Additional Payment is due to
Seller in accordance with this Section 2.09, Buyer shall pay to Seller the
amount of such Additional Payment as calculated pursuant to this Section
2.09. Buyer shall deliver to Seller any cash used to pay such Additional
Payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of
Seller set forth on Schedule 2.09 and Buyer shall deliver to Seller
certificates or book entry shares representing any shares of Buyer Common
Stock used to pay such Additional Payment.

 

 

(f) If there is a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into capital stock),
reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like
change (a "Fundamental Change") with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock
occurring after the date of this Agreement and before the Determination Date,
all references in this Agreement to any class or series affected thereby, and
all calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of shares of any
class or series (or trading prices therefor, including the $9.46 price used
in the calculations in this Section 2.09) affected thereby, shall be
equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other Fundamental Change. If in such
Fundamental Change, the holders of Buyer Common Stock receive securities of
another Person or other property then any such adjustments shall include
delivery of an appropriate amount of such securities or other property if any
shares of Buyer Common Stock are delivered as part of the Additional Payment.

 

 

(g) With respect to any shares of Buyer Common Stock delivered as part of the
Additional Payment, (i) until the first anniversary of date such shares are
delivered, Buyer shall make publicly available the information required by
Rule 144(c)(1) under the Securities Act and (ii) in the event that Buyer
files a registration statement registering shares of Buyer Common Stock
(other than a registration statement relating to a business combination or
employee benefit plan) before the date that is six months following date the
Additional Payment is delivered, if requested by Seller, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to include the shares of Buyer Common Stock
delivered in the Additional Payment in such registration statement and Buyer
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith the terms of such inclusion;
provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to include such shares in
such registration statement for an underwritten offering if the managing
underwriter for such underwritten offering advises Buyer that that marketing
factors require a limitation of the number of securities to be underwritten.
In no event shall shares of Buyer Common Stock issued as part of the
Additional Payment be subject to any contractual lockup provisions.

transactions contemplated thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
Seller of this Agreement and by Seller and each Transferring Subsidiary of
the Ancillary Agreements to which Seller or such Transferring Subsidiary is a
party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been, and the execution, delivery and performance by Seller and

and, assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Acquisition Documents to which it is a party by Buyer, will constitute
the legal, valid and binding agreements of Seller or such Transferring
Subsidiary, enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights
generally or to general principles of equity.

the execution, delivery and performance by Seller and each Transferring
Subsidiary of the other Acquisition Documents to which it is a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, do not and
will not contravene or conflict with the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of Seller or any Transferring Subsidiary, or, except for matters that

Applicable Law binding upon or applicable to Seller, any Transferring
Subsidiary or the Transferred Assets or (b) assuming receipt of the Seller

to the Transferred Assets.

 

 

3.05 Personal Property

 

 

. Seller or one of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to, or a
valid and subsisting leasehold interest in, all of the material tangible
personal property that is a Transferred Asset. None of such personal property

not reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect and (c)
any restriction contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other
Acquisition Documents.

Material Adverse Effect; or (b) that seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other
Acquisition Documents. To Seller's Knowledge, there are no material existing
orders, judgments or decrees of any Governmental Authority against the Seller
or its Subsidiaries relating to the Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities
that would be binding on Buyer or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time.

 

 

3.08 Transferred Contracts

 

 

. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material
Adverse Effect, each Transferred Contract is a valid and binding obligation
of Seller or one of its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, is a valid and binding obligation of each other Person
who is a party thereto, enforceable against it in accordance with its
material terms, subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to creditors' rights generally or to general principles of equity,

Secrets or Patents of any Person. For the avoidance of doubt, a Product shall
not be deemed to infringe or misappropriate a Copyright, Trade Secret or
Patent of any Person and Seller shall not be deemed to have received a claim
from a Person for purposes of this Section 3.11(b) based on (w) any
manufacturing method or process generally used by Seller and not limited to
the Transferred Assets, (x) alleged or actual infringement by an underlying
component unless such component is material and unique to the Products
currently available from Seller; (y) alleged or actual infringement required
for the advertised compliance with an industry standard or recognized
specification available for licensing through an adopters group or other
organization; or (z) reference in the designs, specifications
or documentation of such Product to a product, specification or design of a
third party.

 

 

(c) Seller has taken commercially reasonable steps to protect its rights in
Trade Secrets of Seller embodied in the Products including taking
commercially reasonable steps to have all of its respective current and
former employees, consultants and contractors employed in the Business

agreement. To the Knowledge of Seller, it has not received written notice of
any violation of or non-compliance with such agreements.

licensing of the Transferred Copyrights, the Transferred Patents or the
Products.

 

 

(e) All registered Transferred Patents are currently in material compliance
with formal legal requirements involving the payment of fees to Governmental
Authorities (including payment of filing, examination and maintenance fees).
To the Knowledge of Seller, there are no proceedings or actions pending
before any court or tribunal (including the PTO or equivalent authority
anywhere in the world) to which Seller has been named as party and served
with process that involve the validity, scope or priority of Transferred
Patents. None of the Transferred Copyrights are registered Copyrights.

 

 

(f) To Seller's Knowledge, no software covered in its entirety by a
Transferred Copyright is subject to any "open source license" as that term is
defined by the Open Source Initiative.

 

 

(g) To Seller's Knowledge, none of the Transferred Intellectual Property was

any Governmental Authority or any university, and no government funding,
facilities, faculty or students of a university, college, other educational
institution or research center was used in the development of any Transferred

entity under common control with Seller within the meaning of Section 414(b),

Subsidiaries is pending or, to Seller's Knowledge, threatened in writing with
respect to the Business Employees. Seller has no Knowledge of any activities

not currently represented by a labor or trade union or employee
representative body. To Seller's Knowledge, there are no actions, suits,
claims, labor disputes or grievances pending, or, to the Knowledge of Seller,

additional amounts at the Closing as are necessary in order that the net
Consideration received by Seller, after such deduction or withholding, equals
the amounts which would have been received if such deduction or withholding
had not occurred. Buyer shall promptly furnish Seller with a copy of

any invoice or contract number referred to on the payment or in
correspondence accompanying such payment. To the extent any payment, refund
or other amount received by Seller or Buyer from a customer or other account
debtor does not specify which outstanding invoice or receivable it is in
payment of, such payment shall be applied to the earliest invoice outstanding
with respect to indebtedness of such customer or other account debtor, except
for those invoices which are subject to a dispute to the extent of
such dispute. Following the Closing, Buyer will provide such cooperation as
Seller shall reasonably request, at Seller's expense, in connection

required by Rule 144(c)(1) under the Securities Act and (ii) in the event
that Buyer files a registration statement registering shares of Buyer Common
Stock other than under the Buyer Registration Rights Agreement (other than a
registration statement relating to a business combination or employee benefit
plan) before the date that is six months following the Closing Date, if
requested by Seller, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
include the Share Consideration in such registration statement and Buyer and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith the terms of such inclusion; provided,
however, that Buyer shall not be required to include the Share Consideration
in such registration statement for an underwritten offering if the managing
underwriter for such underwritten offering advises Buyer that that marketing
factors require a limitation of the number of securities to be underwritten.

 

 

5.23 Lease

 

 

. Seller is a party to a lease agreement dated as of April 14, 2000, as such
lease has been amended from time to time (the "Seller Lease") with ProLogis
Limited Partnership I ("Landlord") with respect to the property at (i) 8678
Thornton Avenue, Building A, Newark, CA 94560 ("Newark Facility TB2") and
(ii) 8674 Thornton Avenue, Building 2, Newark CA 94560 ("Newark
Facility TB1").

 

 

(a) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a new
lease, on terms and conditions acceptable to Buyer in its sole discretion, as
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement with respect to Newark
Facility TB1 and Newark Facility TB2. Such lease shall provide for
termination of the Seller Lease with respect to Newark Facility TB1 and
Newark Facility TB2 as of the effective date of the Buyer's lease without any
further obligation or payment by Seller with respect to Newark Facility TB1
and Newark Facility TB2, including a full release by the Landlord of Seller
from Seller's obligation to remove Tenant Made Alterations, Trade Fixtures
and any leasehold improvements to the Original Premises (the "Removal Costs")
(any such lease, the "Buyer Lease"). Such Buyer Lease may be executed in
connection with or combined with the Buyer Lease that Buyer expects to
execute pursuant to the Lassen Purchase Agreement.

 

 

(b) Only in the event that Buyer executes and delivers a Buyer Lease with
Landlord prior to April 30, 2008, Seller shall transfer to Buyer all of
Seller's right, title and interest in the assets listed on Schedule 5.23
(the "Facility Assets"). If the Buyer executes and delivers a Buyer
Lease with Landlord prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
at Closing a Bill of Sale transferring all of Seller's right, title and
interest to the Facility Assets to Buyer as of such date and Buyer shall
deliver to Seller a fully executed Buyer Lease.

 

 

5.24 Continuity of Services by Foxconn. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to encourage Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd ("Foxconn")
to continue to provide to Buyer supply and manufacturing services in
connection with the Transferred Assets on terms and conditions, including
pricing, substantially similar to those services it provided to Seller in
connection with the Business until the earlier of (a) Buyer's execution of a
new agreement with Foxconn, or (b) the expiration or termination of the
manufacturing-related services in the Transition Services Agreement.

 

 

5.25 Lockup. Until the Lockup Termination Date, Seller may not sell, offer to
sell, enter into any contract or agreement to sell, hypothecate, pledge,
grant any option to purchase, make any "short sale" or otherwise dispose of
or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities of Buyer
issued to Seller as Share Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, or
establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a
call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder, with respect to any securities of Buyer issued to
Seller as Share Consideration pursuant to this Agreement and owned by Seller
(including holding as a custodian) or with respect to which Seller has
beneficial ownership within the rules and regulations of the SEC, in each
case, or enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another,
in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any
securities of Buyer issued to Seller as Share Consideration pursuant to
this Agreement. "Short sales" for purposes of this paragraph shall have the
meaning as defined in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO adopted under the Exchange
Act and all types of direct and indirect stock pledges forward sale
contracts, options, puts, calls, short sales, swaps and similar arrangements
(including on a total return basis), and sales and other transactions through
non-US broker-dealers or foreign regulated brokers having the effect of
hedging the securities of Buyer. The "Lockup Termination Date" means the
earlier of (i) the date that is 45 days after the Registration Statement on
Form S-1 filed by Buyer with the SEC on March 13, 2008 is declared effective
by the SEC and (ii) the date that is 45 days after the date as of which all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement may be sold
without restriction by any Person that is not an Affiliate of Buyer pursuant
to Rule 144 (or any successor thereto) promulgated under the Securities Act.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.25 shall apply only to the shares
of Buyer Common Stock issued to Seller as Share Consideration pursuant to
this Agreement. This Section 5.25 shall not apply to shares of Buyer Common
Stock issued to Seller as Stock Consideration under the Lassen Purchase
Agreement or to shares of Buyer Common Stock acquired by Seller in the open
market or otherwise from a party other than Buyer and its Affiliates. Seller
agrees that a legend with respect to the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.25 shall be placed on all certificates representing the Share
Consideration issued to Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

INDEMNIFICATION

 

 

7.01 General Survival

 

 

. The Parties agree that, regardless of any investigation made by the
Parties, the representations and warranties and the indemnification
obligations with respect to the representations and warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive for a period beginning on the date
hereof and ending at 5:00 p.m., California time, on the date that is 12
months after the Closing Date. Upon the expiration of the indemnification
period for a representation or warranty pursuant to this Section 7.01,
unless written notice of a claim based on such representation or warranty
specifying in reasonable detail the facts on which the claim is based shall
have been delivered to the Indemnitor prior to the expiration of such
representation or warranty, such representation or warranty shall be deemed
to be of no further force or effect, as if never made, and no action may be
brought based on the same, whether for indemnification, breach of contract,
tort or under any other legal theory. If written notice of a claim based on a
representation or warranty as described in the prior sentence shall have been
delivered to the Indemnitor prior to the date that is 12 months after the
Closing Date, then such representation or warranty described in such notice
shall survive until the related claim for indemnification has been resolved
in accordance with this Article VII. All covenants and agreements of the
Parties set forth in this Agreement with respect to the actions of the
Parties following the Closing shall survive indefinitely to the extent
necessary to give effect to their terms.

 

 

7.02 Indemnification.

 

 

(a) Indemnification Provisions for Buyer. Subject to the provisions of
Section 7.01, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates,

by Seller from and against and in respect of any and all Losses incurred by
any Buyer Indemnitee arising out of or resulting from:

(b) Indemnification Provisions for Seller. Subject to the provisions of
Section 7.01, from and after the Closing Date, Seller and their Affiliates,
officers, directors, stockholders, employees, representatives and agents
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") shall be indemnified and held
harmless by Buyer from and against and in respect of any and all Losses
incurred by any Seller Indemnitee arising out of or resulting from:

 

 

       

(i)

    |  

any  inaccuracy in or breach of any of Buyer's representations or
warranties,  contained in this Agreement;

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(ii)

    |  

any  misrepresentation contained in any certificate furnished to Seller by 
Buyer pursuant to Section 2.07(f)  or Section  6.02(a);

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(iii)

    |  

any  breach of covenant made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this 
Agreement;

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(iv)

    |  

any  failure of Buyer to satisfy any Assumed Liabilities and any
Liabilities  arising from or relating to the Transferred Assets and arising
subsequent  to the Closing; and

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

       

(v)

    |  

any  Taxes or expenses required to be paid by Buyer under this  Agreement.

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Indemnitee" shall mean
either Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, and the
term "Indemnitor" shall mean either Buyer Indemnitor or a Seller Indemnitor,
as the case may be.

 

 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term, "Losses" means any and all
deficiencies, judgments, settlements, demands, claims, suits, actions
or causes of action, proceedings, assessments, liabilities, losses, Taxes,
damages (excluding indirect, incidental or consequential damages), interest,
fines, penalties, costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable court,
legal, accounting and other costs and expenses) incurred in connection
with investigating, defending, settling or satisfying any and all demands,
claims, actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, assessments, judgments
or appeals, and in seeking indemnification therefor. Notwithstanding
the above, Losses shall not include expenses incurred in connection
with investigations except in connection with claims made by a third party
against the Indemnitee.

 

 

(e) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses
covered by Sections 7.02(a)(i) or (ii) until the aggregate amount of all such
Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees shall exceed $350,000 (the "Basket"), at
which time all such Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees shall be subject
to indemnification by the relevant Indemnitor hereunder (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement). The Basket shall not apply to
Losses covered by Sections 7.02(a)(iii)-(v) or that result from fraud. No
Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses covered
by Section 7.02(b)(i) or (ii) until the aggregate amount of all such Losses
of the Seller Indemnitees shall exceed the Basket, at which time all such
Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnitees shall be subject to indemnification
by the relevant Indemnitor hereunder (subject to the limitations set forth in
this Agreement). The Basket shall not apply to Losses covered by
Sections 7.02(b)(iii)-(v) or that result from fraud.

 

 

(f) The amount of any Losses otherwise recoverable under this Section
7.02 shall be reduced by (i) any amounts to which the Indemnitees actually
receive under insurance policies, the Parties hereby acknowledging and
agreeing that prior to asserting any Indemnification Claim, the Indemnitee
must first seek reimbursement for any and all Losses from any applicable
insurance coverage (and that any compensation provided under this Agreement
is not to be deemed insurance for any purpose); and (ii) any Tax adjustments,
benefits, savings or reductions actually realized by the Indemnitee, provided
that no Indemnitee shall be required to actually realize any such Tax
adjustments, benefits, savings or reductions before making a claim pursuant
to this Article VII.

 

 

7.03 Manner of Indemnification.

 

 

(a) Each indemnification claim shall be made only in accordance with this
Article VII.

 

 

(b) If an Indemnitee wishes to make a claim for Losses under Article VII
of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall deliver a written notice (a "Notice of
Claim") to the applicable Indemnitor promptly after becoming aware of the
facts giving rise to such claim. The Notice of Claim shall (i) specify
in reasonable detail the nature of the claim being made, and (ii) state
the aggregate dollar amount of such claim (or a reasonable and good faith
estimate of such aggregate dollar amount if the actual aggregate dollar
amount is not known).

 

 

(c) Following receipt by Indemnitor of a Notice of Claim, the Parties shall
promptly meet to agree on the rights of the respective Parties with respect
to each of such claims. If the Parties should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both Parties and amounts
agreed upon shall be promptly paid. Any dispute between the Parties
that remains unresolved after ten Business Days following the delivery of a
Notice of Claim shall be resolved in accordance with Section 9.12
and Section 9.13 and the other applicable provisions of this Agreement.

 

 

7.04 Third-Party Claims

 

 

. If an Indemnitee becomes aware of a claim of a third party (including for
all purposes of this Section 7.04, any Governmental Authority) (a "Third
Party Action") that such Indemnitee believes, in good faith, may result in a
claim by it against an Indemnitor, such Indemnitee shall notify the
applicable Indemnitor of such claim as promptly as practicable, provided,
however, that the failure to so notify the Indemnitor shall not affect rights
to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnitor is
materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnitor shall have the right to
assume and conduct the defense of such claim; provided, however, that
Indemnitor may not assume control of the defense of any Third Party Action if
(i) the Third Party Action seeks injunctive relief against the Indemnitee but
not against the Indemnitor or (ii) if the Losses of Indemnitee in respect of
claims subject to the Indemnification Cap in such Third Party Action would
reasonably be expected to be in excess of the Indemnification Cap . The
Indemnitor shall conduct such defense in a commercially reasonable manner at
its own expense, and shall be authorized to settle any such claim without the
consent of the Indemnitee; provided, however, that: (a) the Indemnitor shall
not be authorized to encumber any assets of the Indemnitee or agree to any
restriction that would apply to the Indemnitee or the conduct of the
Indemnitee's business; (b) the Indemnitor shall have paid or caused to be
paid any amounts arising out of such settlement; and (c) a condition to any
such settlement shall be a complete release of the Indemnitee with respect to
such third party claim. The Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in
(but not control, except as set forth in the proviso to the second sentence
of this Section 7.04) the defense of any Third Party Action with its own
counsel and at its own expense. The Indemnitee shall cooperate fully with the
Indemnitor in the defense of any Third Party Action. If the Indemnitor
chooses not to assume the defense of any Third Party Action in accordance
with the provisions hereof, the Indemnitee may defend such Third Party Action
in a commercially reasonable manner and may settle such Third Party Action
after giving written notice of the terms thereof to the Indemnitor. If the
Indemnitor may not assume the control of the defense of a Third Party Action
pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of this Section 7.04, (x) the
Indemnitee shall conduct such defense in a commercially reasonable manner at
its own expense, and shall not settle any such claim without the consent of
the Indemnitor (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless (a) the
Indemnitee shall not be authorized to encumber any assets of the Indemnitor
or agree to any restriction that would apply to the Indemnitor or the conduct
of the Indemnitor's business; (b) the Indemnitee shall have paid or caused to
be paid any amounts arising out of such settlement and Indemnitor shall not
be liable to any Indemnitee or any other Person for any such amounts; and (c)
a condition to any such settlement shall be a complete release of the
Indemnitor with respect to such third party claim and (y) the Indemnitor
shall be entitled to participate in such Third Party Action with its own
counsel and at its own expense.

 

 

7.05 Exclusive Remedy

 

 

.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
except for Losses that result from fraud, the provisions of this Article VII
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages of the
Indemnitees from and after the Closing Date for any Losses arising under this
Agreement or relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including claims of breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in
this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing clause of this sentence
shall not be deemed a waiver by any Party of any right to specific
performance or injunctive relief but shall be deemed a waiver of any rights
of rescission. Except as set forth in Section 9.14, no Indemnitee's rights
under this Article VII shall be adversely affected by any investigation
conducted, or any knowledge acquired by such Indemnitee at any time after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate liability of Seller to the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this
Article VII or otherwise under this Agreement, Applicable Law or otherwise
shall be limited to $3,500,000(the "Indemnification Cap"),
provided, however, that the Indemnification Cap shall not apply to Losses
to covered by Sections 7.02(a)(iv)-(v); and provided, further, only if
the Indemnification Cap is reached with respect to Losses of Buyer
Indemnitees based on claims for Losses based on breach by Seller of
representations, warranties or covenants other than Section 3.13, then Buyer
Indemnitees shall be entitled to make claims for Losses based on breach
by Seller of the representation and warranty set forth in Section 3.13 up to
an additional amount equal to the Indemnification Cap. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the maximum aggregate liability of
Buyer to the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to this Article VII or otherwise
under this Agreement, Applicable Law or otherwise shall be limited to the
Indemnification Cap, provided, however, that the Indemnification Cap shall
not apply to Losses to covered by Sections 7.02(b)(iv)-(v).

 

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement limits or otherwise affects in any way the
rights and remedies of either Party with respect to causes of action arising
under the Intellectual Property Agreement and the Transition Services
Agreement, or any rights and remedies of Seller or Buyer vis-a-vis any Person
other than Seller or Buyer or their respective Affiliates with respect to any
infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property of Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be (including any right of Seller or Buyer to seek
equitable or injunctive relief in connection therewith), all of which rights
and remedies are expressly reserved.

 

 

7.06 Subrogation

 

 

. If an Indemnitor makes any payment under this Article VII in respect of
any Losses, such Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to the rights of the Indemnitee against any insurer or third
party with respect to such Losses; provided, however, that such Indemnitor
shall not have any rights of subrogation with respect to the other Party
hereto or any of its Affiliates or any of its or its Affiliates'
officers, directors, agents or employees.

 

 

7.07 Damages

 

 

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or any
other Acquisition Document, no Party (or its Affiliates) shall, in any event,
be liable to the other Party (or its Affiliates) for any indirect,
incidental, punitive or consequential damages, including, but not limited to,
loss of revenue or income, cost of capital, or loss of business reputation or
opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement. Each
Party agrees that it will not seek punitive damages as to any matter under,
relating to or arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the other Acquisition Documents. The Parties agree that indirect,
incidental, punitive or consequential damages awarded to a third party by a
court of competent jurisdiction in a Third Party Action which a Party is
obligated to pay to such third party shall be deemed actual Losses of such
Party.

Any Party hereto may give any notice, request, demand, claim or other
communication hereunder using any other means (including ordinary mail or
electronic mail), but no such notice, request, demand, claim or other
communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it
actually is received by the individual for whom it is intended.

 

 

9.02 Notice of Change of Control

 

 

. Promptly upon an announcement by Buyer or any other Person of a Change of
Control of Buyer, Buyer shall give Seller written notice thereof, describing
in reasonable detail the applicable Change of Control and identifying each
"person" or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, "group" (as such terms are used in
Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) that is a party to such
transaction or transactions.

 

 

9.03 Amendments; Waivers.

 

 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by all Parties, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against
whom the waiver is to be effective.

 

 

(b) No waiver by a Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach of a
warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
a warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder. No failure or delay by a Party hereto in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided
under Applicable Law.

 

 

9.04 Expenses

 

 

. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
other Acquisition Documents and in closing and carrying out the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the Party
incurring such cost or expense, whether or not such transactions are
consummated. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the obligation of
each Party to pay its own expenses will be subject to any rights of such
Party arising from a breach of this Agreement by the other.

 

 

9.05 Successors and Assigns

 

 

. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors, heirs, personal representatives and
permitted assigns. No Party hereto may transfer or assign either this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder, whether
directly or indirectly, by operation of law, merger or otherwise, without the
prior written approval of each other Party. No such transfer or assignment
shall relieve the transferring or assigning Party of its obligations
hereunder if such transferee or assignee does not perform such obligations.
The closing or other consummation of a transaction constituting a Change of
Control, including a Change of Control pursuant to which the contracting
Parties to this Agreement remain unchanged, shall be deemed to be an
assignment of this Agreement.

 

 

9.06 Governing Law

 

 

. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and any disputes
or controversies related hereto shall be governed by the internal laws of the
State of New York without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles
thereof that would apply the laws of any other jurisdiction.

 

 

9.07 Counterparts; Effectiveness

 

 

. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts and the
signatures delivered by facsimile transmission, each of which shall be an
original, with the same effect as if the signatures were upon the same
instrument and delivered in person. This Agreement shall become effective
when each Party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other Parties.

 

 

9.08 Entire Agreement

 

 

. This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits referred to herein,
which are hereby incorporated by reference), the other Acquisition Documents
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings and negotiations,
both written and oral, between and among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. No representation, warranty, promise,
inducement or statement of intention has been made by either Party that is
not embodied in this Agreement or the other Acquisition Documents, and
neither party shall be bound by, or be liable for, any alleged
representation, warranty, promise, inducement or statement of intention not
embodied herein or therein.

 

 

9.09 Captions

 

 

. The captions herein are included for convenience of reference only and
shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation hereof. All
references to an article, section, exhibit or schedule are references to an
article, section, exhibit or schedule of this Agreement, unless otherwise
specified, and include all subparts thereof.

 

 

9.10 Severability

 

 

. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person, place or circumstance, shall be held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or void, the remainder of this
Agreement and such provisions as applied to other Persons, places and
circumstances shall remain in full force and effect only if, after excluding
the portion deemed to be unenforceable, the remaining terms shall provide for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in substantially the
same manner as originally set forth at the later of the date this Agreement
was executed or last amended. The Parties further agree to replace such
invalid, unenforceable or void provision with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, in a commercially reasonable manner, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, unenforceable or void
provision.

 

 

9.11 Construction

 

 

. The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant
contained herein shall have independent significance. If any Party has
breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) that the Party has not breached shall not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty or covenant.

 

 

9.12 Dispute Resolution.

 

 

(a) All disputes arising directly under the express terms of this Agreement,
including the grounds for termination thereof shall be resolved as follows:
The senior management of the Parties to the dispute shall meet to attempt to
resolve such disputes. In the event that senior management cannot
resolve these disputes, any Party may make a written demand for formal
dispute resolution and specify therein the scope of the dispute. As
promptly as practicable, and in any event within thirty days after such
written notification, the Parties agree to meet for one day with an impartial
mediator and consider dispute resolution alternatives other than litigation.
If an alternative method of dispute resolution is not agreed upon within 30
days after the one day mediation, either Party may begin litigation
proceedings.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.12(a) above, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party shall have the right,
without the requirement of first seeking a remedy through meeting of senior
management, mediation or any other alternative dispute resolution methods, to
seek preliminary injunctive or other equitable relief in any proper court in
the event that such Party determines that eventual redress through such other
methods will not provide a sufficient remedy for any violation of
this Agreement by any other Party.

 

 

(c) In the event a proceeding is brought to enforce or interpret any
provision of this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs in an amount to be fixed by the
court.

 

 

9.13 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

 

(a) The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts
of the State of New York and the Federal courts of the United States of
America, in each case located in New York City solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement, all
Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the other Acquisition Documents and in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree
not to assert, as a defense in any proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts
or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or
any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the Parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such proceeding
shall be heard and determined in the courts of the State of New York and the
Federal courts of the United States of America, in each case located in New
York City. The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such Parties and over the subject matter of
such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection
with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in this Section
9.13 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH
SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (iii) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv)
EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.13.

 

 

9.14 Knowledge of Breach; Disclosure Letters

 

 

. No fact, event, misrepresentation or occurrence that, in the absence of
this Section 9.14, would constitute a breach or breaches of any
representation or warranty of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, under this
Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a breach or breaches by Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be, of its representations or warranties under this
Agreement if Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, has actual knowledge of
such breach or breaches on or before the date hereof. The disclosure of any
information on any section of the Seller Disclosure Letter or the Buyer
Disclosure Letter as the case may be, shall be deemed to constitute the
disclosure of such information on all other sections of the Seller Disclosure
Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter as the case may be, applicable to such
information.

 

 

9.15 Third Party Beneficiaries

 

 

. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person, including any employee or former employee of Seller or
any Affiliate thereof (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof).

 

 

9.16 Specific Performance

 

 

. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the breach of or failure of
any Party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its
failure to take all actions as are necessary on its part to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated herein, may cause irreparable injury to the
other Party, for which damages, even if available, may not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, except as provided in Section 5.16(d),
each Party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court
of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such Party's obligations
and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of
its obligations hereunder.

 

 

9.17 No Presumption Against Drafting Party

 

 

. Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledges that it has been represented by
counsel in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and the other Acquisition Documents. Accordingly, any rule of law or any
legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities
in this Agreement or any of the other Acquisition Documents against the
drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.
