below), in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a)&nbsp;the closing price per share of the Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange as of the date of the Effective Time, by (b)&nbsp;the fraction of one share owned
by the stockholder. Each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Common Stock (&#147;<B>Old Certificates</B>&#148;), shall thereafter represent that number of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of
