CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF

 

CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Standard Pacific, Ryland or
the holders of any shares of capital stock of Standard Pacific or Ryland:

(a) In accordance with the Surviving Corporation Certificate, each five (5)
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Standard Pacific Common
Stock_ ") of Standard Pacific issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be combined and converted (the " _Reverse Split_ ") into
one (1) issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share (" _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "), of the Surviving Corporation
after giving effect to the Reverse Split.

(b) Subject to Section 2.3(f), each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of Ryland (" _Ryland Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Excluded Shares),
together with the associated Ryland Rights (as defined herein), shall
thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable for 1.0191 (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock after giving effect to the Reverse Split
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares
of Ryland Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter only represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to
Section 2.3(f), in each case to be issued or paid in accordance with Section
2.3, without interest.

(c) Each share of Ryland Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by
Standard Pacific immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(d) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate
effect of any stock split, split-up, reverse stock split, stock dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Ryland Common Stock or Standard
Pacific Common Stock, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or
other like change with respect to Ryland Common Stock or Standard Pacific
Common Stock having a record date occurring on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that nothing in this
Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit Ryland or Standard Pacific to take
any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement.

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option (each, a " _Ryland Option_ ") to
purchase shares of Ryland Common Stock granted under any of the Ryland Equity
Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at
the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Ryland
Common Stock and shall be automatically converted into an option to acquire
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (a " _Surviving Corporation
Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or
forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any
acceleration thereof pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant Ryland
Equity Plans or applicable award agreement thereunder by reason of the
transactions

 



4  contemplated hereby) as were applicable under such Ryland Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to adjustment as provided in
this Section 2.2(a). The number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock subject to each such Surviving Corporation Option shall be equal to (i)
the number of shares of Ryland Common Stock subject to each Ryland Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock, and such Surviving Corporation Option shall have an
exercise price per share equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Ryland
Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Ryland Option divided by
(B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest whole cent;
_provided_ , that in the case of any Ryland Option to which Section 421 of
the Code applies as of the Effective Time (taking into account the effect of
any accelerated vesting thereof pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant
Ryland Equity Plans or applicable award agreement thereunder by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby, if applicable) by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to such option and the
terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code;
_provided_ _further_ , that the exercise price, the number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to, and the terms and conditions
of exercise of each Surviving Corporation Option shall also be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each time-based or performance-based restricted
stock unit award, including each performance award granted under the Ryland
2013 Executive Officer Long-Term Incentive Plan, or the Ryland 2014 Executive
Officer Long-Term Incentive Plan, or the Ryland 2015 Executive Officer Long-
Term Incentive Plan (each, a " _Ryland RSU_ ") representing the right to
receive shares of Ryland Common Stock granted under any Ryland Equity Plans,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Ryland Common Stock and shall be
converted into a right to receive shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock (a " _Surviving Corporation RSU_ "), on the same terms and conditions
(including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but
taking into account any acceleration or other deemed satisfaction thereof
pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant Ryland Equity Plans or
applicable award agreement thereunder by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby) as were applicable under such Ryland RSU as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The number of shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock subject to each such Surviving Corporation RSU shall
be equal to (i) the number of shares of Ryland Common Stock subject to each
Ryland RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, at the
Effective Time all performance-based vesting criteria to which any
outstanding Ryland RSUs are subject for which the performance period has not
yet been completed as of the Effective Time shall be deemed achieved at the
target performance level.

 

(c) Ryland shall take such action as may be necessary with respect to Rylands
employee stock purchase plan (the " _Ryland ESPP_ ") to cause, no later than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (i) accumulated
contributions under any then-ongoing offering or purchase period to be used to
purchase shares of Ryland Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
ESPP and (ii) the termination of all options or purchase rights under all such
ongoing offering or purchase periods immediately after such purchase. Any
shares of Ryland Common Stock so purchased shall be treated in accordance
with Section 2.1 above. Ryland shall take such action as may be necessary to
terminate the Ryland ESPP no later than the Business Day immediately preceding
the Closing Date. All amounts withheld by Ryland on behalf of
the participants in the Ryland ESPP that have not been used to purchase
shares of Ryland Common Stock prior to termination of the Ryland ESPP will be
returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the
Ryland ESPP upon the termination of the Ryland ESPP.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Ryland shall adopt such resolutions and shall
take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.2.

 



5 (e) The Surviving Corporation shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock that will be subject to Surviving
Corporation Options and Surviving Corporation RSUs as a result of the actions
contemplated by this Section 2.2. As soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall file a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available, other
appropriate forms, including Form S-3) with respect to the shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to such Surviving Corporation
Options and Surviving Corporation RSUs and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Surviving
Corporation Options and Surviving Corporation RSUs remain outstanding and
are required to be registered.

Section 2.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with a bank or trust company designated by the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of
shares of Ryland Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than holders to the extent they hold Excluded Shares), book-entry shares (or
certificates if requested) representing the shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and cash sufficient to make
payments in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f). In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall make available by depositing with the Exchange Agent, as
necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d). All certificates
representing shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, dividends,
distributions and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a certificate (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Ryland Common Stock that were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to
Section 2.3(f), (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and contain
such other provisions as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock payable
pursuant to Section 2.3(f). Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the shares of Ryland Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate (other than Excluded Shares)
(A) that number of whole shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (after
taking into account all shares of Ryland Common Stock then held by such
holder under all Certificates so surrendered) to which such holder of Ryland
Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested), (B) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.3(d) and (C) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Promptly after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the third Business Day
thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue
and send to each holder of uncertificated shares of Ryland Common Stock
represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), other than with respect
to Excluded Shares, (1) that number of whole shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock to which such holder of Book-Entry Shares shall have become
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(b) (which shall be in book-
entry form unless a physical certificate is requested), (2) any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and (3) any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock

 



6  payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f), without such holder being required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any unpaid dividends and distributions or cash in lieu
of fractional shares, if any, payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f).

 

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax is not applicable.

(d) (i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Surviving
Corporation Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right
to receive upon the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.3(f), in each case until the holder thereof
shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
Following the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II,
there shall be paid to the record holder thereof, without interest, (A)
promptly after such surrender, the amount of any dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock and
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.3(f) and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, holders of
Book-Entry Shares who are entitled to receive shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock under this Article II shall be paid (A) at the time of payment of
such Surviving Corporation Common Stock by the Exchange Agent under Section
2.3(b), the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock, and the amount of any cash payable in lieu
of a fractional share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(f) and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to the time of such payment by the
Exchange Agent under Section 2.3(b) and a payment date subsequent to the time
of such payment by the Exchange Agent under Section 2.3(b) payable with
respect to such whole shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

 

(e) The Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f) issued
and paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Ryland Common Stock (together with the associated Rights) formerly represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Ryland shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the shares of Ryland Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

 



7 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, no dividends or other distributions with respect to the Surviving
Corporation Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of the Surviving
Corporation. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former stockholder of Ryland who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock an amount in cash (without interest) determined
by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive (taking into
account all shares of Ryland Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such
holder and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
pursuant to Section 2.1(b) by (ii) the volume weighted average closing price
of one share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock on the NYSE for the five
trading days ending on the last trading day immediately prior to the date on
which the Effective Time shall occur, as such price is reported on the NYSE
Composite Transactions Tape (as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets or
such other source as the parties shall agree in writing).

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any
remaining holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (except to the extent
representing Excluded Shares) shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for payment of the
Merger Consideration, any unpaid dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.3(f)
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws), without
interest.

(h) None of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any Person in respect of shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock, dividends or other distributions with respect thereto or cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not
have been exchanged prior to two years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which the related Merger
Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions with respect to shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock pursuant to this Article II)
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such Merger Consideration (and such dividends, distributions and cash) in
respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by the Surviving Corporation on a daily basis. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation.

(j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(d) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to
Section 2.3(f).

 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted
and withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable to any

 



8  holder of shares of Ryland Common Stock or otherwise pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made.

Ryland Material Adverse Effect), (6) any failure by Ryland to meet internal or
published projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions, in and of

Agreement, and including any termination of, reduction in or similar negative
impact on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with any customers,

the parties to this Agreement, or the

 



9  performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including compliance with the covenants set forth herein or the failure to
provide any notice to, or to obtain any consent from, any third party related

request of Standard Pacific; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that any change,
effect, event or occurrence referred to in clauses (1), (2), (3), (4) and (7)

Section 3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Ryland has filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") on a timely basis true and complete copies of all
forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be filed
with or furnished to the SEC by Ryland since January 1, 2012 (all such
documents, together with all exhibits and schedules to the
foregoing materials and all information incorporated therein by reference,
the " _Ryland SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on
the date of such filing), the Ryland SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the
case may be, including, in each case, the rules and regulations

 



12  promulgated thereunder, and none of the Ryland SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the Ryland SEC Documents
(i) have been prepared in a manner consistent with the books and records of
Ryland and its Subsidiaries, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ")
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto), (iii) comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (iv) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Ryland and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their respective consolidated results
of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments
that were not, or are not expected to be, material in amount), all in
accordance with GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC. Since December 31, 2014, Ryland has not made any change in the
accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of its financial
statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or applicable Law.
The books and records of Ryland and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP (to the
extent applicable) and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements
and reflect only actual transactions. 

(c) Ryland has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Rylands disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by Ryland in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
Rylands management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Rylands management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Rylands disclosure controls
and procedures in accordance with Rule 13a-15 and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable Ryland SEC Document that is a
report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q its conclusions about the effectiveness of
the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
such report based on such evaluation. Based on Rylands managements most
recently completed evaluation of Rylands internal control over financial
reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) to the knowledge of Ryland,
Ryland had no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design
or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect Rylands ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) Ryland does not
have knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Rylands internal control
over financial reporting.

 

(d) To the knowledge of Ryland, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no
SEC inquiries or investigations, other governmental inquiries or
investigations or internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case
regarding any accounting practices of Ryland.

accrued or reserved against in the audited consolidated balance sheet
of Ryland and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2014 included in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed by Ryland with the SEC on February 25, 2015 (without
giving effect to any amendment thereto filed on or after the date hereof)
and (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2014 that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Ryland
Material Adverse Effect.

 



13 Section 3.8 _Certain Information_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Ryland specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is
filed with the SEC, at the time of any amendment or supplement thereto and at
the time it (or any post-effective amendment or supplement) becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading. The Proxy Statement will not, at
the time it is first mailed to Rylands stockholders, at the time of any
amendments or supplements thereto and at the time of the Ryland Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Ryland makes no representation or warranty with respect to
statements included or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of
Standard Pacific specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein.

investigation, inquiry, audit, examination, grievance or other proceeding
(each, an " _Action_ ") (or basis therefor) pending or, to the knowledge of
Ryland, threatened against or affecting Ryland or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets, other than any Action that,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Ryland Material Adverse Effect. Neither Ryland nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties or assets is subject
to any outstanding judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree of any
Governmental Entity that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Ryland Material Adverse Effect. There is no

and, at all times since January 1, 2012 have been, in compliance with all
Laws applicable to their businesses, operations, properties or assets, except

not reasonably be expected to have a Ryland Material Adverse Effect. None of
Ryland or any of its Subsidiaries has received, since January 1, 2012, a
notice or other written communication alleging or relating to a possible
material violation of any Law applicable to their businesses, operations,
properties or assets, which alleged violation has not been materially
resolved and which, individually or in the aggregate has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Ryland Material Adverse Effect. Ryland and
each of its Subsidiaries have in effect all material permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, approvals, authorizations, consents, operating
certificates, franchises, orders and approvals (collectively, " _Permits_ ")
of all Governmental Entities necessary or advisable for them to own, lease or
operate their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses as now
conducted, except for any Permits the absence of which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Ryland Material
Adverse Effect. All Permits are in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Ryland Material Adverse Effect.

(a) Ryland has furnished or made available to Standard Pacific a true and
complete list of each material Ryland Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, "

Section 4.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Standard Pacific has filed with or furnished to the SEC on a timely basis
true and complete copies of all forms, reports, schedules, statements and
other documents required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC by Standard
Pacific since January 1, 2012 (all such documents, together with all exhibits
and schedules to the foregoing materials and all information
incorporated therein by reference, the " _Standard Pacific SEC Documents_ ").
As of their respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), the
Standard Pacific SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, including, in each case, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Standard Pacific SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the Standard Pacific SEC
Documents (i) have been prepared in a manner consistent with the books and
records of Standard Pacific and its Subsidiaries, (ii) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), (iii)
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto and (iv) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Standard Pacific and its Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and their respective consolidated results of operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments that were not, or are not
expected to be, material in amount), all in accordance with GAAP and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Since December 31,
2014, Standard Pacific has not made any change in the accounting practices or
policies applied in the preparation of its financial statements, except as
required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or applicable Law. The books and records
of

 



26  Standard Pacific and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained
in all material respects in accordance with GAAP (to the extent applicable)
and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only
actual transactions.

(c) Standard Pacific has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms
are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Standard
Pacifics disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Standard
Pacific in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to Standard Pacifics management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Standard Pacifics management has completed an assessment
of the effectiveness of Standard Pacifics disclosure controls and procedures
in accordance with Rule 13a-15 and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
presented in any applicable Standard Pacific SEC Document that is a report on
Form 10-K or Form 10-Q its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such
report based on such evaluation. Based on Standard Pacifics managements most
recently completed evaluation of the Standard Pacifics internal control over
financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) to the knowledge
of Standard Pacific, Standard Pacific had no significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control
over financial reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect Standard Pacifics ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) Standard Pacific does not have knowledge of any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Standard Pacifics internal control over
financial reporting.

 

(d) To the knowledge of Standard Pacific, as of the date of this Agreement,
there are no SEC inquiries or investigations, other governmental inquiries or
investigations or internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case
regarding any accounting practices of Standard Pacific.

accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether or not required to be
recorded or reflected on a balance sheet under GAAP, except (a) to the extent
accrued or reserved against in the audited consolidated balance sheet of
Standard Pacific and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2014 included in the
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Standard Pacific with the SEC on February
23, 2015 (without giving effect to any amendment thereto filed on or
after the date hereof) and (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December
31, 2014 that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Standard Pacific Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.8 _Certain Information_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Standard Pacific specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is
filed with the SEC, at the time of any amendment or supplement thereto and at
the time it (or any post-effective amendment or supplement) becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading. The Proxy Statement will not, at
the time it is first mailed to Standard Pacifics stockholders, at the time of
any amendments or supplements thereto and at the time of the Standard Pacific
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Standard Pacific makes no representation or warranty with respect
to statements included or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf of
Ryland specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

Pacific Material Adverse Effect. None of Standard Pacific or any of its
Subsidiaries has received, since January 1, 2012, a notice or other
written communication alleging or relating to a possible material violation
of any Law applicable to their businesses, operations, properties or assets,
which alleged violation has not been materially resolved and which,

have a Standard Pacific Material Adverse Effect. Standard Pacific and each of
its Subsidiaries have in effect all Permits of all Governmental Entities
necessary or advisable for them to own, lease or operate their properties and
assets and to carry on their businesses as now conducted, except for any
Permits the absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Standard Pacific Material Adverse Effect.

full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Standard Pacific Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.2 _Covenants of Ryland Regarding No Solicitation; Recommendation of
the Merger_.

 

(a) Ryland shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of its
Subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee, investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of Ryland or any of its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, endorse, encourage
or facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to, or the making
or completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer
that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information or data with respect to,
or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
resolve, agree or propose to do any of the foregoing. Ryland shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of Ryland and its
Subsidiaries to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously
granted to any such Person, (B) request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information previously furnished with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, and (C) not terminate,
waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any confidentiality
or standstill agreement to which it or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
potential Acquisition Proposal, and shall enforce the provisions of any such
agreement, which shall include seeking any injunctive relief available to
enforce such agreement ( _provided_ , that Ryland shall be permitted to grant
waivers of, and not enforce, any standstill agreement, but solely to the
extent that the Ryland Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside counsel, that failure to take such action (I) would prohibit
the counterparty from making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal to the Ryland
Board in compliance with this Section 5.2 and (II) would constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Ryland under applicable Law).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time following the date of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining the Ryland Stockholder Approval, (1) Ryland
receives a written Acquisition Proposal that the Ryland Board believes in good
faith to be bona fide, (2) such Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and did
not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.2, (3) the Ryland Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (4) the Ryland Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take
the actions referred to in clause (x) or (y) below would constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Ryland under applicable Law,
then Ryland may (x) furnish information with respect to Ryland and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such

 



41  Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the
disclosing party than, those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement
(including any standstill agreement contained therein) (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , that (I) Ryland shall provide
Standard Pacific a non-redacted copy of each confidentiality agreement Ryland
has executed in accordance with this Section 5.2 and (II) that any non-public
information provided to any such Person shall have been previously provided to
Standard Pacific or shall be provided to Standard Pacific prior to or
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal. Ryland shall not provide
(and shall not permit any of its Representatives to provide) any commercially
or competitively sensitive non-public information in connection with the
actions permitted by this Section 5.2(a), except in accordance with "clean
room" or other similar procedures designed to limit any adverse effect of the
sharing of such information on Ryland, which procedures shall be consistent in
all material respects with Rylands practices in dealing with the disclosures
of such information to Standard Pacific or its Representatives.

(b) Neither the Ryland Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Standard
Pacific) the recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Ryland
Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (B) recommend or otherwise declare advisable
the approval by the Ryland stockholders of any Acquisition Proposal, or (C)
resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions (each such action set forth
in this Section 5.2(b)(i) being referred to herein as an " _Ryland Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); or

 

(ii) cause or permit Ryland or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract, except for an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "),
in each case constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is
reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve, agree or
propose to take any such actions.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Ryland
Stockholder Approval, the Ryland Board may, if the Ryland Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so
would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Ryland
under applicable Law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement that may be offered by Standard Pacific pursuant to this
Section 5.3, make a Ryland Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either
(x) a Superior Proposal or (y) an Intervening Event; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that Ryland may not make a Ryland Adverse Recommendation Change in response
to a Superior Proposal unless:

(A) Ryland notifies Standard Pacific in writing at least five Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
Person making, such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy
(if any) of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other
relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by Ryland and a new five Business
Day period); and

(B) if Standard Pacific makes a proposal during such five Business Day period
to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Ryland Board, after
taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement
as proposed by Standard Pacific, continues to determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such
Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
make a Ryland Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Ryland under applicable Law;

 



42 provided further, that the Ryland Board may not make a Ryland Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event unless:

(1) Ryland provides Standard Pacific with written information describing such
Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably practicable
after becoming aware of it;

(2) Ryland keeps Standard Pacific reasonably informed of developments with
respect to such Intervening Event;

(3) Ryland notifies Standard Pacific in writing at least five Business
Days before making a Ryland Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to
such Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons
therefor; and

 

(4) if Standard Pacific makes a proposal during such five Business Day period
to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Ryland Board, after
taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement
as proposed by Standard Pacific, continues to determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make such
Ryland Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Ryland under applicable Law.

During the five Business Day period prior to its effecting a Ryland Adverse
Recommendation Change as referred to above, Ryland shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Standard Pacific in good faith
(to the extent Standard Pacific seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions
to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by
Standard Pacific. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
neither Ryland nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement or submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger) unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms (including the payment of the
Ryland Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(b), if applicable).

(c) In addition to the obligations of Ryland set forth in Section 5.2(a) and
Section 5.2(b), Ryland promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt)
shall advise Standard Pacific in writing in the event Ryland or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any indication by any Person
that it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry or
request for information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely
to lead to or that contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)
any proposal or offer that is or is reasonably likely to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case together with a description of the material
terms and conditions of and facts surrounding any such indication, inquiry,
request, proposal or offer, the identity of the Person making any such
indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written
proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by such Person. Ryland shall keep
Standard Pacific informed (orally and in writing) in all material respects on
a timely basis of the status and details (including, within 24 hours after the
occurrence of any amendment, modification, development, discussion or
negotiation) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or
offer, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence
and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries
or discussions. Without limiting any of the foregoing, Ryland shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) notify Standard Pacific orally and in
writing if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in
discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.2(b) and shall in no event begin providing such
information or engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing
such notice. Ryland shall provide Standard Pacific with at least 24 hours
prior notice (or such shorter notice as may be provided to the Ryland Board)
of a meeting of the Ryland Board at which the Ryland Board is reasonably
expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) Ryland agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.2 by any Representative of Ryland or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of Ryland or any of
its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a material breach of this
Agreement by Ryland.

 



43 (e) Ryland shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict Rylands ability to comply with any of the terms
of this Section 5.2, and represents that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement.

(f) Ryland shall not take any action to (i) exempt any Person (other than
Standard Pacific and its respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on
"business combinations" contained in Section 3-602 of the MGCL (or any similar
provision of any other Takeover Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not
to apply or (ii) amend or waive the Rights Agreement, redeem the Rights or
exempt any Person (other than Standard Pacific and its respective Affiliates)
from the Rights Agreement, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms
(including the payment of the Ryland Termination Fee pursuant to Section
7.3(b), if applicable).

(g) Nothing contained in Section 5.2(a) shall prohibit Ryland from taking and
disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Ryland Adverse
Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section 7.1(c)(ii)) unless
the Ryland Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to Rylands
stockholders in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger in such
disclosure and expressly rejects any applicable Acquisition Proposal.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, with respect to any party, any proposal
or offer with respect to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in
one transaction or a series of transactions, and whether through any merger,

stock acquisition, asset acquisition, binding share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture or otherwise, of (A) assets or businesses of such party and its
respective Subsidiaries that generate 15% or more of the net revenues or net
income (for the 12-month period ending on the last day of such partys most
recently completed fiscal quarter) or that represent 15% or more of the total
assets (based on fair market value) of such party and its
respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such
transaction, or (B) 15% or more of any class of capital stock, other equity
securities or voting power of such party, any of its respective Subsidiaries
or any resulting parent company of such party, in each case other than the
Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any unsolicited bona fide binding written
Acquisition Proposal that is fully financed or has fully committed financing
that the Ryland Board or the Standard Pacific Board, as applicable, determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisor), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, is (A) more
favorable to the stockholders of the applicable party from a financial point
of view than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by
the other party in response to such proposal) and (B) reasonably likely of
being completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis; _provided_ , that,
for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," references in the term
"Acquisition Proposal" to "15%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%";
and

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event or circumstance that was
not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Ryland Board or the Standard
Pacific Board, as applicable, prior to the execution of this Agreement (or if
known, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable),

known to the Ryland Board or the Standard Pacific Board, as applicable, prior
to the receipt of the Ryland Stockholder Approval or the Standard Pacific
Stockholder Approval, as applicable, that does not relate to (A) an
Acquisition Proposal, (B) the other party or its

 



44  Subsidiaries (including any Material Adverse Effect as it relates to the
other party or its Subsidiaries), (C) any actions taken pursuant to this
Agreement or (D) any changes in the price of Standard Pacific Common Stock or
Ryland Common Stock.

or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information or data with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Acquisition Proposal

any such Person, (B) request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, and (C) not terminate, waive,

Proposal, and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement, which shall
include seeking any injunctive relief available to enforce such agreement (
_provided_ , that Standard Pacific shall be permitted to grant waivers of,
and not enforce, any standstill agreement, but solely to the extent that the
Standard Pacific Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside counsel, that failure to take such action (I) would prohibit the
counterparty from making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal to the Standard
Pacific Board in compliance with this Section 5.3 and (II) would constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Standard Pacific under
applicable Law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time following the
date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Standard Pacific Stockholder

the Standard Pacific Board believes in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such
Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a

with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal. Standard Pacific shall not provide (and shall not permit any of its
Representatives to provide) any commercially or competitively sensitive non-
public information in connection with the actions permitted by this Section
5.3(a), except in accordance with "clean room" or other similar procedures
designed to limit any adverse effect of the sharing of such information on
Standard Pacific, which procedures shall be consistent in all material
respects with Standard Pacifics practices in dealing with the disclosures of
such information to Ryland or its Representatives.

 

(b) Neither Standard Pacific Board nor any committee thereof shall:

Pacific Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to do so would result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Standard Pacific under applicable Law, taking
into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be
offered by Ryland pursuant to this Section 5.2, make a Standard Pacific

other relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by Standard Pacific and a new five

the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Standard Pacific Board, after
taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement
as proposed by Ryland, continues to determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that
such Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to make a Standard Pacific Adverse Recommendation Change would result

the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Standard Pacific Board, after
taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement
as proposed by Ryland, continues to determine in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make such Standard
Pacific Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of Standard Pacific under applicable
Law.

Adverse Recommendation Change as referred to above, Standard Pacific shall,
and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Ryland in

Ryland with at least 24 hours prior notice (or such shorter notice as may be
provided to the Standard Pacific Board) of a meeting of the Standard Pacific
Board at which the Standard Pacific Board is reasonably expected to consider
an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) Standard Pacific agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this Section 5.3 by any Representative of Standard Pacific or any of its

of any other Takeover Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply,
or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms (including the payment of the
Standard Pacific Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(d), if applicable).

 

(g) Nothing contained in Section 5.3(a) shall prohibit Standard Pacific from
taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_
,  _however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Standard Pacific
Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section 7.1(d)(ii))
unless the Standard Pacific Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to
Standard Pacifics stockholders in favor of the approval of this Agreement
and the Merger in such disclosure and expressly rejects any applicable
Acquisition Proposal.

 



47 Section 5.4 _Preparation of Form S-4 and Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Ryland and
Standard Pacific shall jointly prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a
proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") to be sent to the stockholders of Ryland relating to the special
meeting of Rylands stockholders (the " _Ryland Stockholders Meeting_ ") and
the stockholders of Standard Pacific relating to the special meeting of
Standard Pacifics stockholders (the " _Standard Pacific Stockholders Meeting_
") to be held to consider the adoption of this Agreement. As promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, Standard Pacific shall
prepare (with Rylands reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, the " _Form S-4_"), in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus, in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of
the Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. Each of
Ryland and Standard Pacific shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as
is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Standard Pacific shall also take any action (other than qualifying to
do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing
a general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance
of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock in the Merger and Ryland
shall furnish all information concerning Ryland and the holders of Ryland
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action. Ryland shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to Rylands stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Standard Pacific
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
Standard Pacifics stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement will be made by Standard
Pacific or Ryland, as applicable, without providing the other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and without the others prior
approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Standard Pacific or
Ryland, as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives oral
or written notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective
or any amendment or supplement thereto has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Surviving
Corporation Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction or any oral or written request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will
promptly provide the other with copies of any written communication from the
SEC or any state securities commission and a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the responses thereto. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to Ryland or Standard Pacific, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Ryland
or Standard Pacific that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents
would not contain any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
Ryland and Standard Pacific shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC
of an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to
the extent required under applicable Law, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to Rylands stockholders and
Standard Pacifics stockholders;  _provided_ that the delivery of such notice
and the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act, Ryland shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Ryland Stockholders Meeting solely for the purpose of obtaining the Ryland
Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, the advisory vote required by Rule
14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith (and such Ryland
Stockholders Meeting shall in any event be no later than forty-five (45)
calendar days after (i) the tenth (10th) calendar day after the preliminary
Proxy Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC if by such date the SEC
has not informed Ryland that it intends to review the Proxy Statement or (ii)
if the SEC has, by the tenth (10th) calendar day after the preliminary Proxy

 



48  Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC, informed Ryland that it
intends to review the Proxy Statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that
it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement). Ryland may postpone or
adjourn the Ryland Stockholders Meeting solely (i) with the consent of
Standard Pacific; (ii) (A) due to the absence of a quorum or (B) if Ryland has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares for the
Ryland Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, to solicit
additional proxies; (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Ryland Board
has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is
necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure
to be disseminated and reviewed by Rylands stockholders prior to the Ryland
Stockholders Meeting; or (iv) if Standard Pacific has postponed or adjourned
the Standard Pacific Stockholders Meeting pursuant to Section 5.4(c), until
the date on which the Standard Pacific Stockholders Meeting is held; 
_provided_ , that Ryland may not postpone or adjourn the Ryland Stockholders
Meeting more than a total of two times pursuant to clause (ii)(A) and/or
clause (ii)(B) of this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ryland shall,
at the request of Standard Pacific, to the extent permitted by Law, adjourn
the Ryland Stockholders Meeting to a date specified by Standard Pacific for
the absence of a quorum or if Ryland has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Shares for the Ryland Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
that Ryland shall not be required to adjourn the Ryland Stockholders Meeting
more than one time pursuant to this sentence, and no such adjournment pursuant
to this sentence shall be required to be for a period exceeding 10 Business
Days. Except in the case of a Ryland Adverse Recommendation Change
specifically permitted by Section 5.2(b), Ryland, through the Ryland Board,
shall (i) recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement and (iii) publicly reaffirm such recommendation within 24
hours after a request to do so by Standard Pacific. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Ryland agrees that its obligations pursuant to
this Section 5.4(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to Ryland or any other Person of
any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of any Ryland Adverse
Recommendation Change.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act, Standard Pacific shall duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Standard Pacific Stockholders Meeting solely for the purpose of
obtaining the Standard Pacific Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, the
advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith (and such Standard Pacific Stockholders Meeting shall in any event
be no later than forty-five (45) calendar days after (i) the tenth calendar
day after the preliminary Proxy Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC
if by such date the SEC has not informed Standard Pacific that it intends to
review the Proxy Statement or (ii) if the SEC has, by the tenth calendar
day after the preliminary Proxy Statement therefor has been filed with the
SEC, informed Standard Pacific that it intends to review the Proxy Statement,
the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement). Standard Pacific may postpone or adjourn the Standard
Pacific Stockholders Meeting solely (i) with the consent of Ryland; (ii) (A)
due to the absence of a quorum or (B) if Standard Pacific has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares for the Standard Pacific
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, to solicit
additional proxies; (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing
and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Standard
Pacific Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by Standard Pacifics
stockholders prior to the Standard Pacific Stockholders Meeting; or (iv) if
Ryland has postponed or adjourned the Ryland Stockholders Meeting pursuant to
Section 5.4(b), until the date on which the Ryland Stockholders Meeting is
held; _provided_ , that Standard Pacific may not postpone or adjourn the
Standard Pacific Stockholders Meeting more than a total of two times pursuant
to clause (ii)(A) and/or clause (ii)(B) of this Section. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Standard Pacific shall, at the request of Ryland, to the extent
permitted by Law, adjourn the Standard Pacific Stockholders Meeting to a date
specified by Ryland for the absence of a quorum or if Standard Pacific has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Shares for the Standard
Pacific Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that Standard Pacific shall not be
required to adjourn the Standard Pacific Stockholders Meeting more than one
time pursuant to this sentence, and no such adjournment pursuant to this
sentence shall be required to be for a period exceeding 10 Business Days.
Except in the case of a Standard Pacific Adverse Recommendation

 



49  Change specifically permitted by Section 5.3(b), Standard Pacific, through
the Standard Pacific Board, shall (i) recommend to its stockholders that they
adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (iii) publicly reaffirm such
recommendation within 24 hours after a request to do so by Ryland. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Standard Pacific agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.4(c) shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Standard
Pacific or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of
any Standard Pacific Adverse Recommendation Change.

(d) Subject to Rylands and Standard Pacifics rights under Section 5.4(b)
and Section 5.4(c), respectively, Ryland and Standard Pacific shall cooperate
in good faith to coordinate the timing of the Ryland Stockholders Meeting and
the Standard Pacific Stockholders Meeting such that they occur on the same
day (it being understood that nothing in this Section 5.4(d) shall in any way
limit Rylands or Standard Pacifics respective obligations under Section 5.6
or otherwise under this Agreement to use their respective required efforts to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, Ryland and Standard
Pacific shall each, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries, officers, directors and representative to,
afford to the other reasonable access during normal business hours,
consistent with applicable Law, to each of its respective officers, employees,
properties, offices, other facilities and books and records, and shall furnish
the other with all financial, operating and other data and information as the
other shall reasonably request in writing (it being agreed, however, that the
foregoing shall not permit the other or its respective officers, employees or
representatives to conduct any environmental testing or sampling, including
but not limited to facility surface and subsurface soils and water, air or
building materials). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or
consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the other party or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the other party of their
normal duties. Neither party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would (i) breach any agreement with any third-party, (ii) constitute a waiver
of or jeopardize the attorney-client or other privilege held by such party
or (iii) otherwise violate any applicable Law.

(b) The parties will hold and treat and will cause its respective
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the other furnished to each other in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 8, 2015, between Standard Pacific and
Ryland (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) obtain all required consents, approvals or
waivers from, or participation in other discussions or negotiations with,
third parties, including as required under any Ryland Material Contract or
Standard Pacific Material Contract, as applicable, (ii) obtain all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations
from Governmental Entities, make all necessary registrations, declarations
and filings and make all reasonable best efforts to obtain an approval or
waiver from, or to avoid any Action by, any Governmental Entity, (iii)
vigorously resist and contest any Action, including administrative or
judicial Action, and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and that could restrict, prevent or
prohibit consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby,

 



50  including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal and (iv) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
fully to carry out the purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Ryland, Standard Pacific nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall commit to the payment of any fee, penalty or other consideration or
make any other concession, waiver or amendment under any Contract in
connection with obtaining any consent without the prior written consent of the
other party. Each of the parties hereto shall furnish to each other
party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to
applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Ryland and Standard
Pacific shall each have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each shall consult with the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Ryland or Standard Pacific, as the case may be, and
any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall be
permitted to designate certain information as "outside counsel only" and/or to
redact any information which could be protected by a claim of privilege or
which may constitute a business secret. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of Ryland and Standard Pacific shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, Ryland and Standard Pacific shall keep each other
reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other written communications received by Ryland or
Standard Pacific, as the case may be, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or third party with respect to
such transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the circumstances,
shall provide the other party and its counsel with the opportunity to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.7 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts, to the
extent permitted by the terms of its or its Subsidiaries applicable employee
benefit plans, programs and policies, to provide each employee of Ryland and
its Subsidiaries who is employed immediately prior to the Closing and who
continues employment with the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries thereafter (each such employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ ")
with credit for all service with the Ryland or its Subsidiaries as if such
service were with the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for purposes
of determining eligibility, vesting, levels of benefits and benefit accrual
under the Surviving Corporations employee benefit and compensation plans to
the same extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of
Ryland or its Subsidiaries. Unused vacation days accrued by Continuing
Employees under the plans and policies of Ryland and its Subsidiaries shall
carry over to the Surviving Corporation. This Section 5.7(a) shall not operate
to duplicate any benefit provided to any employee, require the Surviving
Corporation to continue in effect any specific Ryland Plan or Surviving
Corporation employee benefit plan, or prohibit the termination of employment
of any specific employee, following the Effective Time.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, and without limiting the generality of
Section 5.7(a), with respect to any health plan (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, includes medical, dental, vision and prescription drug) of the
Surviving Corporation in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is first
eligible to participate, the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, cause any
pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
Surviving Corporation or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such
Continuing Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Ryland Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall
maintain the 401(k), health and welfare plans (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, include medical, dental, vision, prescription drug, life insurance, AD
and D, disability insurance and flex spending) of Ryland in effect through the
end of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



51 (c) Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement, policy or
arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Surviving
Corporation, Standard Pacific, Ryland or any of their respective affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement, policy or
arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any
of them. This Section 5.7 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
5.7, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
5.7.

 

Section 5.8 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of Ryland and Standard Pacific and their respective Board of
Directors shall take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Ryland and Standard Pacific
shall promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any other notice or
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (c) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such
party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions contemplated
hereby or (d) any change, condition or event (i) that renders or would
reasonably be expected to render any representation or warranty of such party
set forth in this Agreement (disregarding any materiality qualification
contained therein) to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii)
that results or would reasonably be expected to result in any failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement (including any condition set forth in Article VI) to be
complied with or satisfied hereunder;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties
hereunder; _provided_ _further_ , that failure to give prompt notice pursuant
to clause (d) shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the Merger set
forth in Article VI except to the extent that the underlying fact or
circumstance not so notified would standing alone constitute such a failure.
The parties agree and acknowledge that, except with respect to clause (d) of
the first sentence of this Section 5.9, neither Rylands nor Standard
Pacifics compliance or failure of compliance with this Section 5.9 shall be
taken into account for purposes of determining whether the conditions referred
to in Section 6.2(b) or Section 6.3(b) shall have been satisfied.

 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any agreement or Ryland Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the
Effective Time) and former officer, director or employee of Ryland and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, "
_Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director,
employee, fiduciary or agent of Ryland or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such Action, (A)
each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred
in the defense of any Action from the Surviving Corporation to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law within ten (10) Business Days of receipt
by the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
_provided_ , that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by applicable Law, to repay
such advances if it is

 



52  ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification,
(B) the Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (C)
the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

 

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Standard Pacific and Ryland
agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational documents) of Ryland and its Subsidiaries or in
any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and Ryland or any
of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and
effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Ryland and its Subsidiaries or
provide substitute policies or purchase a "tail policy," in any case of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are
not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
annual premiums in excess of 225% of the last annual premium paid by Ryland
prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained
pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ _further_ , that if the
Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder
costs more than 225% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 225% of
such last annual premium. At Rylands option, Ryland may purchase, prior to
the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions
(in both amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Ryland and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without
limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_
, that such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual
premiums shall not exceed 225% of the last annual premium paid by Ryland prior
to the date hereof. If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained by Ryland
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and shall
honor all obligations thereunder.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 5.10 shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Action.

 

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and
assets to any Person,

 



53  then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. 

Section 5.11 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Standard Pacific shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger, and such other shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with the
Merger, to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice
of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

Section 5.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. Ryland shall give Standard Pacific
the opportunity to participate in (but not control) the defense and
settlement of any stockholder litigation against Ryland and/or its officers or
directors, and Standard Pacific shall give Ryland the opportunity to
participate in (but not control) the defense and settlement of any
stockholder litigation against Standard Pacific and/or its officers or
directors, in each case relating to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
a mutually agreed upon joint defense agreement. Neither Ryland nor Standard
Pacific shall enter into any settlement agreement in respect of any
stockholder litigation against it and/or its directors or officers relating to
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby without the
other partys prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 5.13 _Certain Tax Matters_. Ryland and Standard Pacific each agree to
(i) deliver certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published
advanced ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and modifications
thereto, to enable counsel to deliver the tax opinions required by Section
6.2(e) and Section 6.3(e), which certificates shall be effective as of the
date of such tax opinion, (ii) not, and to not permit any of their
Subsidiaries to, take or cause to be taken any action on or before the
Effective Time, which would reasonably be expected to disqualify the Merger as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (iii)
file (and agree to cause their respective Subsidiaries to file) all Tax
Returns consistent with the treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Section 5.14 _Public Announcements_. Ryland and Standard Pacific shall, to
the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing,
and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any
such press release or make any public announcement prior to such consultation
and review, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. The initial press release of
the parties announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press
release of Standard Pacific and Ryland in a form that is mutually agreed.

Section 5.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Standard Pacific and Ryland shall take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispositions of Ryland Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to such Ryland Common Stock) or acquisitions of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to such Surviving Corporation Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to Ryland or will become subject to such reporting requirements with
respect to the Surviving Corporation to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.16 _Financing_.

 

(a) The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
any term loan or revolving credit facility necessary to fund the refinancing
of Rylands existing credit facility at the Effective Time and the Surviving
Corporations working capital needs from and after the Effective Time (it
being understood that obtaining such financing is not a condition to
the parties obligations to consummate any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement), including providing and causing their respective
Subsidiaries to provide, and

 



54  using reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to provide, all
cooperation reasonably requested by the other party in connection with
obtaining any such financing; _provided_ that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the parties and
their respective Subsidiaries; and _provided_ , _further_ , that none of the
parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to enter
into any agreements in connection therewith that would be binding if the
Merger does not occur). Each party shall, to the extent it is aware of any
applicable developments, promptly update any information provided by it for
use in an offering document to be used in connection with any such financing
to the extent such information would otherwise contain any untrue statement of
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading. Each party consents to the reasonable use, prior to
the termination of this Agreement, of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with any such financing in a manner customary for such financing
transactions; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to nor is reasonably likely to harm or disparage such party in
any way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall have any obligation
under this Section 5.16 at any time that the other party is in breach of or
default under any covenant, obligation or agreement required to be performed
or complied with by it under this Agreement if such breach or default would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from being completed on or prior
to the Outside Date. Rylands existing credit facility shall be refinanced at
the Effective Time.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Standard Pacific shall execute and deliver to
the Trustee (as defined in the applicable indenture) a supplemental indenture
to the indenture for the Ryland Convertible Notes containing the provisions
required by such indenture as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
including by providing that at the Effective Time, each $1,000 principal
amount of then-outstanding Ryland Convertible Notes shall no longer be
convertible into shares of Ryland Common Stock and shall thereafter be
convertible solely into the number of Surviving Corporation Common Stock that
a holder of a number of shares of Ryland Common Stock equal to the Conversion
Rate (as defined in the applicable indenture) immediately prior to the
Effective Time would have been entitled to at the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, Ryland shall execute and deliver to the Trustee (as defined
in the applicable indenture) (i) an officers certificate containing the
provisions required by such indenture as in effect on the date of this
Agreement and (ii) an opinion of counsel (which may rely on such officers
certificate as to the absence of defaults and events of default), each stating
that the proposed Merger and such supplemental indenture will, upon
consummation of the proposed Merger, comply with the indenture for the
Ryland Convertible Notes as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(c) Each of Standard Pacific, Ryland and the Surviving Corporation shall take
all actions necessary in order to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation assumes, to the extent reasonably required, all of the
obligations of Ryland and Standard Pacific pursuant to their respective
existing indentures without default.

Section 5.17 _Surviving Corporation Name_. Ryland and Standard Pacific shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to mutually agree upon the new name of
the Surviving Corporation at or prior to the date on which the Proxy Statement
is sent to the stockholders of Ryland and the stockholders of Standard
Pacific.

operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further

 _AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK_

 

SECTION 1 _Number of Authorized Shares_. The Corporation shall be authorized
to issue two classes of shares of stock to be designated,
respectively, "Common Stock" and "Preferred Stock"; the total number of
shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation shall have authority to
issue is six hundred ten million (610,000,000) shares, consisting of
six hundred million (600,000,000) shares of Common Stock, par value of $.01
per share, and ten million (10,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock, par value
$.01 per share.

 

SECTION 2 _Common Stock_. Shares of Common Stock may be issued from time to
time in one or more series. Shares of Common Stock that are
redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation may be reissued
except as otherwise provided by law. The Board is hereby authorized to fix or
alter the designations, powers and preferences, and relative, participating,
optional or other rights, if any, and qualifications, limitations or
restrictions thereof, including, without limitation, dividend rights (and
whether dividends are cumulative), conversion rights, if any, voting rights
(including the number of votes, if any, per share, as well as the number of
members, if any, of the Board or the percentage of members, if any, of the
Board each series of Common Stock may be entitled to elect), rights and terms
of redemption (including sinking fund provisions, if any), redemption price
and liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series of Common Stock, and
the number of shares constituting any such series and the designation thereof,
and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any such series subsequent
to the issuance of shares of such series, but not below the number of shares
of such series then outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board
shall have no power to alter the rights of any shares of Common Stock then
outstanding. Unless and until the Corporation shall file with the Delaware
Secretary of State  a certificate of designations creating a series of Common Stock, all shares
of Common Stock shall be of one class without series and shall be denominated
"Common Stock." Upon the first filing with the Delaware Secretary of State of
a certificate of designations creating a series of Common Stock, which series
shall be denominated "Class B Common Stock," each share of Common Stock
outstanding or held in the treasury immediately prior to such filing shall be
denominated "Class A Common Stock," and each certificate representing then
outstanding shares of Common Stock shall thereafter be deemed to represent
shares of Class A Common Stock.

 

SECTION 3 _Preferred Stock_. Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time
to time in one or more series. Shares of Preferred Stock that are redeemed,
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation may be reissued except as
otherwise provided by law. The Board is hereby authorized to fix or alter the
designations, powers and preferences, and relative, participating, optional or
other rights, if any, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereof, including, without limitation, dividend rights (and whether dividends
are cumulative), conversion rights, if any, voting rights (including the
number of votes, if any, per share, as well as the number of members, if any,
of the Board or the percentage of members, if any, of the Board each class or
series of Preferred Stock may be entitled to elect), rights and terms of
redemption (including sinking fund provisions, if any), redemption price and
liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and
the number of shares constituting any such series and the designation thereof,
and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any such series
subsequent to the issuance of shares of such series, but not below the number
of shares of such series then outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Board shall have no power to alter the rights of any shares of Preferred Stock
then outstanding.

SECTION 4 _Distributions Upon Liquidation_. In the event of any dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether
voluntary or involuntary, after payment or provision for payment of the debts
and other liabilities of the Corporation, the holders of each series of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, out of the net assets of
the Corporation, an amount for each share of such series of Preferred Stock
equal to the amount fixed and determined by the Board in the resolution or
resolutions creating such series and providing for the issuance of such
shares, and no more, before any of the assets of the Corporation shall be
distributed or paid over to the holders of Common Stock and any Preferred
Stock with rights to participate with the Common Stock in such event. If, upon
such dissolution, liquidation or winding up, the assets of the Corporation
distributable as aforesaid among the holders of Preferred Stock of all series
shall be insufficient to permit full payment to them of said preferential
amounts, then such assets shall be distributed ratably among such holders of
Preferred Stock in proportion to the respective total amounts which they shall
be entitled to receive as provided in this Section 4\. After payment in full
of said preferential amounts to the holders of Preferred Stock of all
series, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation shall be divided
among and paid to the holders of shares of each series of Common Stock and
shares of Common Stock without series, and any Preferred Stock with rights to
participate with the Common Stock in such event, each in accordance with the
resolution or resolutions of the Board creating such series and providing for
the issuance of such shares.

 

SECTION 5 _Reverse Stock Split_. Upon the filing and effectiveness (the
"Effective Time") pursuant to the Delaware Law of this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, each five (5) shares
of Common Stock either issued and outstanding or held by the Corporation in
treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically
and without any action on the part of the respective holders thereof, be
combined and converted into one (1) share of Common Stock (the "Reverse Stock
Split"). No fractional shares shall be issued in connection with the Reverse
Stock Split. Stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive
fractional shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash (without
interest or deduction) from the Corporations transfer agent in lieu of
such fractional share interests upon the submission of a transmission letter
by a stockholder holding the shares in book-entry form and, where shares are
held in certificated form, upon the surrender of the stockholders Old
Certificates (as defined below), in an amount equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (a) the closing price per share of the Common Stock as reported
on the New York Stock Exchange as of the date of the Effective Time, by (b)
the fraction of one share owned by the stockholder. Each certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Common Stock
("Old Certificates"), shall thereafter represent that number of shares of
Common Stock into which the shares of Common Stock represented by the Old
Certificate shall have been combined, subject to the elimination of fractional
share interests as described above. ARTICLE VI

 

 _ANNUAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS_

 

The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at such time, on such date

the Bylaws of the Corporation. Subject to any requirement of applicable law,
the books of the Corporation may be kept outside the State of Delaware at such
place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board or in
the Bylaws of the Corporation. Elections of directors need not be by written
ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation shall so provide.

 

ARTICLE VII

_CALL OF SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS_

Special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or
purposes may be called at any time by a majority of the members of the Board
of Directors or by a committee of the Board of Directors which has been duly
designated by the Board of Directors and whose power and authority, as
provided in a resolution by the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the
Corporation, includes the power to call such meetings. Special meetings of
stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes shall be called by
the Secretary of the Corporation upon the written request or requests of one
or more stockholders of record that, at the time a request is delivered, hold
shares representing at least a majority of the voting stock entitled to vote
on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting and
that comply with such procedures for calling a special meeting of
stockholders as may be set forth in the Bylaws of the Corporation. Except as
otherwise required by law or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, special meetings of stockholders of
the Corporation may not be called by any other Person or Persons or in any
other manner.

ARTICLE VIII

_NUMBER OF DIRECTORS_

 

The number of directors that shall constitute the whole Board shall be as
specified in the Bylaws of the Corporation, as the same may be amended from
time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during any period in which the
holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting as a class, shall
be entitled to elect a specified number of directors by reason of
dividend arrearages or other contingencies giving them the right to do so,
then and during such time as such right continues, (A) the then otherwise
authorized number of directors shall be increased by such specified number of
directors and the holders of shares of such series of Preferred Stock, voting
as a class, shall be entitled to elect such specified number of directors in
accordance with the procedure set forth in the resolution or resolutions of
the Board creating such series and providing for the issuance of such shares
and (B) each such additional director shall serve until his or her successor
shall be elected and shall qualify, or until his or her right to hold such
office terminates pursuant to the resolution or resolutions of the Board
creating such series of Preferred Stock and providing for the issuance of
shares of such series, whichever occurs earlier. Whenever the holders of
shares of such series of Preferred Stock are divested of such right to elect
directors pursuant to the resolution or resolutions of the Board creating
such series and providing for the issuance of such shares, the terms of office
of all directors elected by the holders of such series of Preferred Stock
pursuant to such rights, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the
death, resignation or removal of directors so elected by the holders of such
series, shall forthwith terminate and the authorized number of directors shall
be reduced accordingly. ARTICLE IX

 

 _STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT_

 

Subject to any rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to act
by written consent as set forth in the applicable certificate
of designations, any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders
of the Corporation may be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting
of stockholders and may be effected by a written consent or consents by
stockholders in lieu of and without such a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if there is filed with the records of stockholders meetings a
unanimous written consent which sets forth the action and is signed by each
stockholder entitled to vote on the matter and a written waiver of any right
to dissent signed by each stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting but
not entitled to vote at it. To be effective, a written consent must be
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered agent in the State
of Delaware. Delivery made to the Corporations registered office shall be by

Shared Officer must present the opportunity in the first instance to
the Corporation);

(C) any corporate opportunity offered to any person who is a Shared Officer
shall belong to the Investor or the applicable member or partner of the
Investor and its Affiliates if such opportunity was expressly offered to such

chairman of the meeting shall have the authority to adopt and enforce such
rules and regulations for the conduct of any meeting of stockholders and the
safety of those in attendance as, in the judgment of the chairman, are

disregarded or such other business shall not be transacted.

SECTION 2.6 _Voting_.

to vote in person or by proxy each share of the stock of the Corporation
having voting rights on the matter in question and which shall have been held
by such stockholder and registered in such stockholders name on the books of
the Corporation on the date fixed pursuant to Section 6.5 hereof as
the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of
and to vote at such meeting.

(B) Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another
entity, if a majority of the shares or other interests entitled to vote in the
election of directors (or equivalent) in such other entity is held, directly
or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be
counted for quorum purposes. Persons holding stock of the Corporation in a
fiduciary capacity shall be entitled to vote such stock. Persons whose stock
is pledged shall be solely entitled to vote such pledged stock, unless in the
transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation the pledgor shall have
expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the
pledgee, or the pledgees proxy, may represent such stock and vote thereon.
Stock having voting power standing of record in the names of two or more
persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants
in common, tenants by the entirety or otherwise, or with respect to which two
or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship, shall be voted in
accordance with the provisions of the Delaware Law.

(C) Any voting rights may be exercised by the stockholder entitled thereto in
person or by such stockholders proxy duly authorized as such by any means
permitted under the Delaware Law (including without limitation, in writing or
by transmitting or authorizing an electronic transmission, or by any copy,
facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of such
authorization) and delivered to the secretary of the meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years
from its date unless the proxy shall provide for a longer period. The
attendance at any meeting of a stockholder who may theretofore have given a
proxy shall not have the effect of revoking the same unless such stockholder
shall in writing, or by any other means permissible for authorizing a proxy,
deliver to the secretary of the meeting, prior to the voting of the proxy, a
revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date.

 

(D) At any meeting of the stockholders, all matters, except as otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, in these Bylaws or
by applicable law, shall be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority in
voting interest of the stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled
to vote thereat and thereon, a quorum being present. The vote at any meeting
of the stockholders on any question need not be by ballot, unless so directed
by the chairman of the meeting. On a vote by ballot each ballot shall be
signed by the stockholder voting, or by such stockholders proxy, if there be
such proxy, or be submitted by electronic transmission _provided_ that such
electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information
from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was
authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder, and it shall state the number
of shares voted.

SECTION 2.7 _List of Stockholders_. The Secretary of the Corporation shall
prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a
complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of such stockholder. Such list shall be open
to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting,
for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, either (i) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, _provided_ that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the
meeting or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of
business of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then
the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of
remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of
any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such
list shall be provided with the notice of such meeting. SECTION 2.8 _Inspector of Elections_. The Corporation shall, in advance of any
meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting
and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more
persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If
no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
chairman presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act
at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of the
duties of inspector, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the
duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to
the best of such inspectors ability. Such inspector shall (i) ascertain the
number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, (ii) determine the
shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on each question, (iii)
determine the validity of proxies and ballots, (iv) accept the votes, and
count all votes and ballots, (v) determine and retain for a reasonable period
a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the
inspectors, and (vi) certify their determination of the number of shares
represented at the meeting, and their count of the votes and ballots voted
respectively for and against each question. Reports of inspectors shall be in
writing and subscribed and delivered by them to the Secretary of the
Corporation. The inspectors need not be stockholders of the Corporation, and
any officer of the Corporation may be an inspector on any question other than
a vote for or against a proposal in which such officer shall have a material
interest.

_however_ , that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast
at any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (i) if,
pursuant to these Bylaws, the number of director candidates to be nominated
at such meeting exceeds the number of directors to be elected or if a
stockholder has submitted notice of an intent to nominate a candidate for
election in accordance with Section 2.9  of these Bylaws unless, on or before the seventh (7th) business day prior to

Commission its definitive proxy statement relating to such meeting (regardless
of whether thereafter revised or supplemented), such notice has been (a)
withdrawn in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation, (b) determined

such directors address, or in the case of facsimile or other electronic
transmission at the facsimile number or other address for such transmissions,
as it is shown upon the records of the Corporation, or, if it is not so shown
on such records and is not readily ascertainable, at the place in which the
meetings of the directors are regularly held. In case such notice is mailed,
it shall be deposited in the United States mail in the County in which the
principal office for the transaction of the business of the Corporation is

Bylaws, notice of the purpose of a special meeting need not be given. Notice
of any meeting of the Board shall not be required to be given to any director
who is present at such meeting, except a director who shall attend such

directors shall be required to constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business at any meeting of the Board, and all matters shall be decided at any
such meeting, a quorum being present, by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the directors present. A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may
continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors,
_provided_ any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required
quorum for such meeting. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of directors
present at any meeting may adjourn the same from time to time until a
quorum shall be present. Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given.
The directors shall act only as a Board, and the individual directors shall
have no power as such.

 

SECTION 3.10 _Action by Consent_. Any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof may be taken without
a meeting if consent in writing or by electronic transmission is given thereto
by all members of the Board or of such committee, as the case may be and such
consent or electronic transmission is filed with the minutes of proceedings
of the Board or of such committee. Any person (whether or not then a director)
may provide, whether through instruction to an agent or otherwise, that a
consent to action shall be effective at a future time (including a time
determined upon the happening of an event), no later than 60 days after such
instruction is given or such provision is made and such consent shall be
deemed to have been given at such effective time so long as such person is
then a director and did not revoke the consent prior to such time. Any such
consent shall be revocable prior to its becoming effective.

SECTION 3.11  _Compensation_. Directors may receive such compensation, if
any, for their services on the Board and its committees, and such
reimbursement of expenses, as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the
Board. In addition, a fixed fee, with or without expenses of attendance, may
be authorized by resolution of the Board for attendance at each meeting,
including for attendance at each meeting of a committee of the Board. Nothing
herein contained shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the
Corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee, or
otherwise, and receiving compensation therefor.

Article X of these Bylaws, the Board may designate such committees as it
shall determine. Each committee shall consist of two or more of the members of
the Board and shall serve at the pleasure of the Board. The Board may
designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee to
replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In
the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or
members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or
not he, she or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another
member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member. To the extent provided in any applicable resolution or
charter approved by a majority of the members of the Board and subject to any
restrictions or limitations on the delegation of power and authority imposed
by applicable law, any such committee shall have and may exercise all the
powers and authority of the Board in the management of the business and
affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to
be affixed to all papers which may require it. Any such committee shall keep
written minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board. Unless the
Board or these Bylaws shall otherwise prescribe the manner of proceedings of
any such committee, meetings of such committee may be regularly scheduled in

certificate or certificates or uncertificated shares shall be issued in
exchange for any existing certificate until such existing certificate
shall have been so cancelled, except in cases provided for in Section 6.4
hereof. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the rights and
obligations of the holders of uncertificated shares and the rights and
obligations of the holders of certificated shares of the same class and
series shall be identical. SECTION 6.2 _Transfers of Stock_. Transfers of shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation upon
authorization by the registered holder thereof, or by such holders attorney
thereunto authorized by power of attorney duly executed and filed with the
Secretary, or with a transfer clerk or a transfer agent appointed as provided
in Section 6.3 hereof. Upon surrender to the Corporation, or a transfer agent
of the Corporation, of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied
by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer and the
payment of all taxes thereon, the Corporation may issue a new certificate, or,
upon request, evidence of the equivalent uncertificated shares, to the person
entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon
its books. Upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the holder of
uncertificated shares and the payment of all taxes thereon, the Corporation
shall cancel such uncertificated shares and issue new equivalent
uncertificated shares, or, upon such holders request, certificated shares,
to the person entitled thereto, and record the transaction upon its books. The
person in whose name shares of stock stand on the books of the Corporation
shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards the
Corporation, except as otherwise provided by law. Whenever any transfer of
shares shall be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, such fact
shall be so expressed in the entry of transfer if, when the shares shall be
presented to the Corporation for transfer, both the transferor and the
transferee request the Corporation to do so.

 

SECTION 6.3 _Regulations_. The Board may make such rules and regulations as it
may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these Bylaws, concerning the issue,
transfer and registration of uncertificated and certificated shares of stock
of the Corporation. It may appoint, or authorize any officer or officers to
appoint, one or more transfer clerks or one or more transfer agents and one
or more registrars, and may require all certificates for stock to bear the
signature or signatures of any of them.

 

SECTION 6.4 _Lost, Stolen, Destroyed, and Mutilated Certificates_. In any case
of loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of any certificate of stock,
another certificate or uncertificated shares may be issued in its place upon
proof of such loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation and upon the giving of a
bond of indemnity to the Corporation in such form and in such sum as the
Board (or any officer or officers of the Corporation to whom the Board may
delegate such power) may direct; provided, however, that a new certificate or
uncertificated shares may be issued without requiring any bond when, in the
judgment of the Board (or such officer or officers), it is proper so to do.

SECTION 6.5 _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_. In
order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment
of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other
change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted nor be
more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting, nor more
than 60 days prior to any other action. If no record date is set by the Board,
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the next day
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held. If in any case involving the determination of stockholders for any
purpose other than notice of or voting at a meeting of stockholders, the Board
shall not fix such a record date, then the record date for determining
stockholders for such purpose shall be the close of business on the day on
which the Board shall adopt the resolution relating thereto. A determination
of stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders
shall apply to any adjournment of such meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

is or was a party, or is threatened to be made a party to, any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether or not by or in the
right of the Corporation, and whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise; _provided_ , _however_
, except for claims for   indemnification (following the final disposition of such proceeding), the
foregoing shall not require the Corporation to indemnify any person in
connection with any action, suit, proceeding, claim or counterclaim initiated
by or on behalf of such person other than an action authorized by the Board.
The indemnification provided herein shall not be deemed to limit the right of
the Corporation to indemnify any other person to the fullest extent permitted
by the Delaware Law, nor shall it be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which any person seeking indemnification from the Corporation may be entitled
under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors,
or otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office. The Corporation may
enter into indemnification agreements with any one or more of its directors,
officers, employees and agents upon resolution duly adopted by the Board.
Such agreements may indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permissible
under law.

jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware); in all
cases subject to the courts having personal jurisdiction over the
indispensable parties named as defendants.

SECTION 8.2 _Personal Jurisdiction_. If any action the subject matter
of which is within the scope of Section 8.1 of these Bylaws is filed in a

state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal
district court for the District of Delaware) (a "Foreign Action") in the name
of any stockholder (including any beneficial owner, within the meaning of
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), such stockholder shall be deemed to have
consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts
located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in
any such court to enforce Section 8.1 of these Bylaws and (ii) having service
of process made upon such stockholder in any such action by service upon such
stockholders counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

interest in shares of stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice
of and consented to the provisions of this Article VIII. If any provision of

applied to any person or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of
such provision in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of
this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence
of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or

thereby.
