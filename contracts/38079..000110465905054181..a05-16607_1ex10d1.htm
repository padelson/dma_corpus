which the Merger shall become so effective is herein referred to as the
"Effective Time."

Section 2.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  



  

### (a) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
deposit with such bank or trust company as shall be agreed upon by Spinco and
the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of holders of shares
of Spinco Common Stock and for exchange in accordance with this Article
II, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares

  

### 

  

### 13   

     
   

  

### 

  

### of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.2 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Spinco Common Stock as of the Effective Time (such
certificates for shares of Company Common Stock, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto to which the holders thereof may be
entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(c), being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Company Common Stock contemplated to be issued
pursuant to Section 2.2 from the shares of stock held in the Exchange Fund.
 The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures._ As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates whose shares were converted
pursuant to Section 2.2 into the right to receive shares of Company Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Spinco and the Company may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for the use of such letter of transmittal in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing the shares of Company Common Stock that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to this Article II. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as
may be appointed by Spinco and the Company, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and any other required documents, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Company Common Stock
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article II (and
any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.8(c)), and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Spinco Common Stock that is not registered
in the transfer records of Spinco, a certificate representing the proper
number of shares of Company Common Stock (and any dividends or distributions
pursuant to Section 2.8(c)) may be issued to a transferee only on the
condition that the Certificate formerly representing such shares of Spinco
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, properly endorsed, and
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or
that no such taxes are applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.8, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender a certificate
representing shares of Company Common Stock (and any dividends or
distributions pursuant to Section 2.8(c)). The Exchange Agent shall not be
entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the
Company Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it
shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or
distributed with respect thereto for the account of persons entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed, the Company shall cause
to be delivered in exchange for such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed
Certificate the consideration deliverable in respect thereof as determined in
accordance with this Article II. When authorizing the delivery of such
consideration in exchange therefor, the Company may, in its sole discretion
and as a condition precedent to the delivery thereof, require the owner of
such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate to give the Company a
bond, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, and in
such sum as the

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

Company may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Company or the Exchange Agent with respect to
the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed.

  



  

### (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Company Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock which such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to the terms hereof, until the holder of record of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable
laws, following the surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to
the record holder of the certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Company Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date therefor,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to the surrender of such Certificate and a payment
date subsequent to the surrender of such Certificate payable with respect to
such whole shares of Company Common Stock. Spinco shall deposit in the
Exchange Fund all such dividends and distributions.

  

### 

  

### (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Spinco Common Stock_ _._ All shares
of Company Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates formerly representing shares of Spinco Common Stock (including
any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.8(c)) shall be deemed to have been issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Spinco Common
Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
made available to the Exchange Agent that remains undistributed to the
holders of Spinco Common Stock on the eighteen-month anniversary of the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company, upon demand, and any
stockholders of Spinco who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment of their claim for
Company Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to
Company Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.8(c).

  

### 

  

### (f) _No Liability._ Neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for shares of Company Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto or with respect to Spinco Common Stock) or
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

### 

  

Section 2.9 _Certain Stock Options_.

  



  

### (a) Not later than immediately before the Effective Time, Forest and the
Company shall take such actions as may be required to provide that, effective
as of the Effective Time, each Unvested Forest Stock Option shall be
converted into an option to acquire (from the

  

### 

  

### 15   

     
   

  

### 

  

### Company), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Unvested Forest Stock Option immediately before the Effective Time, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Forest Common Stock subject to such Unvested Forest Stock Option
immediately before the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded
to the nearest whole number of shares), at a price per share (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share of Forest Common
Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Unvested Forest Stock Option
divided by the Option Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that with respect to
any Unvested Forest Stock Option, such conversion shall be effected such that
(i) the aggregate intrinsic value of the award immediately after the
conversion is not greater than the aggregate intrinsic value (as determined
pursuant to GAAP) of the Unvested Forest Stock Option immediately before the
conversion, (ii) the ratio of the exercise price per share to the market
value per share is not reduced as a result of the conversion and (iii) the
substitution requirements of QandA 4(d)(ii) of Internal Revenue Service Notice
2005-1 are otherwise met.

  

### 

  

### (b) For purposes of Section 2.9(a) above, "Option Exchange Ratio" shall
mean the quotient (rounded to the third decimal place) determined by
dividing (i) the average of the daily closing prices per share of Forest
Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Transactions Reporting System (regular
way), as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , for the last five trading
days immediately preceding the Effective Time by (ii) the average of the
daily closing prices per share of Company Common Stock on the NYSE Composite
Transactions Reporting System (regular way) or on Nasdaq (regular way), as
applicable and as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ , for the first five
trading days following the Effective Time.  The Option Exchange Ratio shall
be subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock split, stock
dividend or recapitalization after the date of this Agreement applicable to
shares of Forest Common Stock or Company Common Stock. The Company shall take
all actions necessary to reserve for issuance, from and after the Effective
Time, a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock for delivery
pursuant to the options described in Section 2.9(a).  On or as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Company (x) shall cause to be filed
with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form under the
Securities Act with respect to shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
options described in Section 2.9(a) and shall use reasonable efforts to
maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein, as well as
to comply with any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws, for so
long as such options remain outstanding and (y) shall cause the shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the options described in Section 2.9(a)
to be listed on the NYSE or quoted on Nasdaq.

  

### 

  

### (c) The provisions of this Section 2.9 shall not apply to any Forest
Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is subject to Section 3.1 of the
Employee Benefits Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (d) By adopting or approving this Agreement, (i) the Board of Directors
of the Company shall be deemed to have approved and authorized each and every
amendment to any of the Company Stock Plans as the officers of the Company
may deem necessary or appropriate to give effect to the preceding provisions
of this Section 2.9, and (ii) the Board of Directors of Forest shall be
deemed to have approved and authorized each and every amendment to any of the
Forest Incentive Plans and the Forest Stock Options as the officers of Forest
may deem necessary or appropriate to give effect to the preceding provisions
of this Section 2.9.

or condition is known to exist that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect such tax-qualified status for any such Spinco Benefit Plan or any such
trust.

  

### 

  

### (f) Except for a Spinco Benefit Plan that provides retiree medical
benefits, no Spinco Benefit Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization,
death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or former
employees of Spinco or any Subsidiary of Spinco for periods extending beyond
their retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage
mandated by applicable law, (ii) death benefits under any "pension plan,"

Spinco Benefit Plan or to amend such Spinco Benefit Plan to reduce future
benefits without incurring or otherwise being responsible for any material
liability with respect thereto.

  

### 

  

### (g) In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, no payment of money or other property, acceleration of
benefits or provision of other rights has been or will be made hereunder,
under any agreement contemplated herein, or under any Spinco Benefit Plan or
any Contract listed in Section 4.15 of the Spinco Disclosure Schedule that
could reasonably be expected to be nondeductible under Section 280G of the
Code, whether or not some other subsequent action or event would be required
to cause such payment, acceleration or provision to be triggered.

respective Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining
agreement or other Contract with a labor union or labor organization that
would affect the Spinco Business and no collective bargaining agreement
is being negotiated by Forest, Spinco or any of their respective Subsidiaries
that would affect the Spinco Business. With respect to Spinco Employees,
none of Forest, Spinco or any of their respective Subsidiaries is the subject
of any proceeding asserting that it has committed an unfair labor practice or
is seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or
conditions of employment nor is there any strike, work stoppage or other
labor dispute involving Forest, Spinco or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or the Spinco Business pending or, to Spincos or Forests
Knowledge, threatened, that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Spinco Business or Spinco. There are no labor
controversies pending or, to Spincos or Forests Knowledge, threatened
against Forest, Spinco or any of their respective Subsidiaries that,

the Spinco Business as currently conducted, except where the failure to own
or possess such items, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Spinco Business or Spinco. To Forests or
Spincos Knowledge, there is no assertion or claim challenging the validity
of any of the foregoing that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Spinco Business or Spinco. The conduct of the
Spinco Business as currently conducted does not and will not conflict in any
way with any seismic data license, patent, patent right, license,
trademark, trademark right, trade name, trade name right, copyright, service
mark, trade secret, know-how or other proprietary rights or information of
any third party that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Spinco Business or Spinco.

deeds of trust, liens, security interests, pledges, leases, conditional sale
contracts, claims, charges, liabilities, obligations, privileges, easements,
rights of way, limitations, reservations, restrictions, options, rights of
first refusal and other encumbrances of every kind ("Liens") except for
Permitted Liens and Liens associated with obligations reflected in the Spinco
Reserve Report. The oil and gas leases and other agreements that provide
Forest and its Subsidiaries, and that as of the Effective Time will provide
Spinco and its Subsidiaries, with operating rights in the oil and gas
properties reflected in the Spinco Reserve Report are legal, valid and
binding and in full force and effect, the rentals, royalties and other
payments due thereunder have been properly paid and, to Forests and Spincos
Knowledge, there is no existing default (or event that, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would become a default) under any of such oil and gas leases
or other agreements, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Spinco Business or Spinco. Each of
Spinco and Forest and their respective Subsidiaries (as the case may be) has
maintained all the Spinco Assets owned on the date hereof in working order
and operating condition, subject only to ordinary wear and tear.  The Spinco
Assets constitute all the assets, properties and rights related to or
required for the conduct of the Spinco Business as currently conducted,
except for the services to be provided pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement. The Spinco Assets include all properties reflected in the Spinco
Reserve Report.

  



  

Section 4.22 _Loans_. There are no outstanding loans made to any Person by
Forest, Spinco or any of their respective Subsidiaries that are or will be
Spinco Assets.

  



  

Section 4.23 _ Oil and Gas Reserves_. Forest has furnished to the Company
reserve reports prepared by Forest containing estimates of the oil and gas
reserves, as of December 31, 2004 and June 30, 2005 (collectively, the
"Spinco Reserve Report"), that will be owned by Spinco and the
Spinco Subsidiaries upon completion of the Contribution. The factual, non-
interpretive data on which the Spinco Reserve Report was based for purposes
of estimating the oil and gas reserves set forth therein was accurate in all
material respects, and to the Knowledge of Forest no errors in such
information existed at the time such information was provided. The Spinco
Reserve Report conforms to the guidelines with respect thereto of the SEC.
Except for changes (including changes in hydrocarbon commodity prices)
generally affecting the oil and gas industry and normal depletion by
production, there has been no change in respect of the matters addressed in
the Spinco Reserve Report that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Spinco Business or Spinco. Since January 1,
2003 all wells included in the Spinco Assets have been drilled and (if
completed) completed, operated and produced in compliance in all respects
with applicable oil and gas leases and applicable laws, except where any such
failure or violation would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco, the
Spinco Assets or the Spinco Business. To the Knowledge of Forest and Spinco,
there are no wells included in the Spinco Assets that Forest, Spinco or any
of their respective Subsidiaries are (i) currently obligated by applicable
law or Contract to plug and abandon, or (ii) obligated by applicable law or
Contract to plug and abandon with the lapse of

  



  

30   

     
   

  



  

time or notice or both because the well is not currently capable of producing
in commercial quantities. No Person has any call on, option to purchase or
similar rights with respect to the production of hydrocarbons attributable to
the Spinco Assets, except any such call, option or similar right at market
prices. Except for gas imbalances between Forest, Spinco or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and any third party working interest owners,
marketers or pipelines relative to the Spinco Assets that have accrued since
June 30, 2005, neither Forest, Spinco nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries is obligated by any gas prepayment arrangement or by
any "take-or-pay" requirement, advance payment or other similar arrangement
to deliver any gas at a future time without then or thereafter receiving
payment therefor. With respect to any oil and gas interests comprising Spinco
Assets that are not operated by Forest, Spinco or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, Forest and Spinco make the representations and warranties set
forth in this Section 4.23 only to Forests and Spincos Knowledge.

  



  

Section 4.24 _ Derivative Transactions_. Neither Forest nor Spinco nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries has entered into any Derivative Transaction
pursuant to which Spinco, any Spinco Subsidiary or the Spinco Business has or
will have a continuing financial liability or obligation. All Derivative
Transactions entered into by Forest, Spinco or any of their respective
Subsidiaries that are currently open and pursuant to which Spinco, any Spinco
Subsidiary or the Spinco Business has or will have a continuing financial
liability or obligation were entered into in material compliance with
applicable rules, regulations and policies of all regulatory authorities.

  



  

Section 4.25 _ No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Article III and in this Article
IV and except for any representations and warranties specifically set forth
in the other Transaction Agreements, the Company acknowledges that neither
Forest nor Spinco nor any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Spinco or its Subsidiaries, the
Spinco Business or otherwise or with respect to any other information
provided to the Company, whether on behalf of Forest, Spinco or such other
Persons, including as to (i) merchantability or fitness for any particular
use or purpose, (ii) the use of the Spinco Assets and the assets of the
Spinco Business and the operation of the Spinco Business after the Closing in
any manner or (iii) the success or profitability of the ownership, use or
operation of the Spinco Business after the Closing. Neither Forest, Spinco nor
any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification
obligation to the Company or any other Person to the extent resulting from
the distribution to the Company, or the Companys use of, any information
related to the Spinco Business and any other information, document or
material made available to the Company in certain "data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

information set forth in one section of the Company

  



  

31   

     
   

  



  

Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other Section thereof to

the laws of the State of Delaware, has all requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted and is duly qualified and licensed to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of
its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except for jurisdictions in which the failure to be so
qualified or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The copies of the
Companys Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Fourth
Amended and Restated Bylaws in existence on the date hereof included as part
of Section 5.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule are complete and correct
and in full force and effect on the date hereof. The Company is not in

the Company Subsidiaries and their respective jurisdictions of
incorporation or organization (together with a designation of those
Subsidiaries constituting Significant Subsidiaries of the Company) are
identified in Section 5.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Merger Sub was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted
its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.2 _Capital Stock and Other Matters_. The authorized capital stock
of the Company consists of 70,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock

issued and outstanding, including 2,267,270 shares of restricted stock issued
to employees pursuant to the Companys Equity Participation Plan, and
2,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance as
restricted stock or upon the exercise of stock options granted or that may be

have been issued as restricted stock and 807,960 of such shares are subject
to stock options that have been granted to employees and directors; (ii) no
shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company in its treasury or by
its Subsidiaries; (iii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding; and (iv) no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries having the right to vote (or
convertible into securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
holders of shares of capital stock of the Company may vote ("Company Voting
Debt") were issued or outstanding.  All of the issued and outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
are not subject to preemptive rights. Except as set forth in this Section
5.2, there are no outstanding (i) shares of Company Common Stock, Company

Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of capital stock, Company Voting Debt or other voting securities of
the Company or (iii) except as specified in Section 2.9, options, warrants,

otherwise relating to, shares of capital stock of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Company Voting Debt or other voting securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant,
call, right, commitment or Contract. There are no stockholder agreements,
voting trusts or other Contracts to which the Company is a party or by which
it is bound relating to the voting or transfer of any shares of capital stock
of the Company.  The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000
shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, all of which are owned by
the Company. Each outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and each such share
owned by the Company is free and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements, limitations on
the voting rights of the Company or such Company Subsidiary, charges and
other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

previously made available to Forest complete and correct copies of audited
consolidated financial statements for the Company as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, and unaudited consolidated interim
financial statements for the Company as of and for the three-month periods
ended March 31, 2005 and June 30, 2005 (including any related notes and

Statements fairly present in all material respects the financial position of

thereof and the results of operations and changes in financial position or
other information included therein for the respective periods or as of the
respective dates then ended, in each case except as otherwise noted therein
and subject, where appropriate, to normal year-end audit adjustments, in each
case in accordance with past practice and GAAP, consistently applied, during
the periods involved (except as otherwise stated therein). Except as
set forth in the Company Financial Statements, the Company and its
Subsidiaries do not have any liability or obligation (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) of a nature or character required to be
reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company or in the
footnotes thereto, in each case prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than
(i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since June 30,
2005, (ii) liabilities that individually or in the aggregate, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) liabilities and
obligations under the Transaction Agreements.

Company and its Subsidiaries has conducted its business only in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice, and, since such date,
there has not been, occurred or arisen any change, or any event (including
any damage, destruction or loss whether or not covered by insurance),
condition or state of facts of any character that, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, whether or
not arising in the ordinary course of business.

Section 5.6 _ Investigations; Litigation_.

  



  

### (a) To the Companys Knowledge, no investigation or review by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is pending or threatened, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries an intention to conduct the same.

  

### 

  

### (b) There is no Action pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened
against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at law or in
equity, or before any Governmental Authority or arbitrator, that, (i) if
adversely determined, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or (ii) seeks to delay or prevent the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. There is no Order of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator
outstanding against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or with respect to
any of their properties or assets that, individually or in the aggregate,
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  

### 

  

Section 5.7 _ Licenses; Compliance with Laws_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries hold all Licenses that are required for the conduct of the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as
presently conducted, except such Licenses for which the failure to so hold,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the
terms of all such Licenses so held, except where the failure so to comply,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.  No suspension or cancellation of any of the Companys Licenses
is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, except where the
failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Companys
Licenses would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except with
respect to Environmental Laws, ERISA and laws relating to Taxes, the Company
and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all, and have received no notice
of any violation (as yet unremedied) of any, laws, ordinances or regulations
of any Governmental Authority applicable to any of them or their respective
operations, except for such instances of noncompliance which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

Section 5.8 _ Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statements_. None of
the information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement provided by the Company specifically for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statements
will, in the case of the definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of the mailing of the definitive
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto and at the
time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or, in the case of each
Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective, at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, at the Distribution Date and at the Effective
Time, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the

Registration Statement on Form 10) will comply in all material respects with
the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation
is made by the Company with respect to information provided by Forest and
Spinco specifically for inclusion in the

  



  

35

projections) previously furnished by the Company to Forest relating to
the Company or its business was (taken as a whole, including disclosures set
forth in the Companys Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed with the
SEC, as amended) true and correct in all material respects on the date on
which such information was furnished and did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact relevant to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or necessary
to make the statements contained therein not misleading.

responsible for filing with any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or by any other Transaction Agreement will

any amendments thereto (or if the plan is not a written plan, a description
thereof), any related trust or other funding vehicle, any reports or
summaries required under ERISA or the Code for the most recent reporting
period and the most recent determination letter received from the IRS (if
any) with respect to each such plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (b) No liability under Title IV (including Sections 4069 and 4212(c) of
ERISA) or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of any of them that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of any of them of
incurring any such liability, other than liability for premiums due the PBGC
(which premiums have been paid when due). No Company Benefit Plan is subject
to Title IV of ERISA, Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

  

### 

  

### (c) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliate of any of them has made or suffered a "complete
withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal," as such terms are respectively defined
in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, which has not been satisfied in full.

  

### 

  

### (d) Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable law, including,
but not limited to, ERISA and the Code. All contributions required to be
made with respect to any Company Benefit Plan have been timely made. There
are no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened claims by, on
behalf of or against any of the Company Benefit Plans or any assets thereof,
other than routine benefit claim matters, that, if adversely determined
could, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material liability for
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and no matter is pending (other than
routine qualification determination filings, copies of which have been
furnished to Forest and Spinco or will be promptly furnished to Forest and
Spinco when made) with respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans before the
IRS, the United States Department of Labor or the PBGC.

  

### 

  

### (e) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the trusts
maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code, each trust maintained under any Company Benefit Plan intended to
satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has satisfied
such requirements and, in either such case, no event has occurred or
condition is known to exist that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect such tax-qualified status for any such Company Benefit Plan or any
such trust.

  

### 

  

### (f) No Company Benefit Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization,
death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or former
employees of Company or any Company Subsidiary for periods extending beyond
their retirement or other termination of

  

### 

  

### 39   

     
   

  

### 

  

### service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, (ii) death
benefits under any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which
is borne by the current or former employee (or his beneficiary). The Company
has the right, and will have the right after the Effective Time to terminate
any Company Benefit Plan or to amend any such Company Benefit Plan to reduce
future benefits (including any Company Benefit Plan that provides post-
retirement medical and life insurance benefits) without incurring or
otherwise being responsible for any material liability with respect thereto.

  

### 

  

### (g) In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, no payment of money or other property, acceleration of
benefits or provision of other rights has been or will be made hereunder,
under any agreement contemplated herein, or under any Company Benefit Plan or
any Contract listed in Section 5.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule that
could reasonably be expected to be nondeductible under Section 280G of the
Code, whether or not some other subsequent action or event would be required
to cause such payment, acceleration or provision to be triggered.

  

### 

  

Section 5.13 _ Labor Matters_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement
or other Contract with a labor union or labor organization and no collective
bargaining agreement is being negotiated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject
of any proceeding asserting that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
committed an unfair labor practice or is seeking to compel it to bargain with
any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment nor is there
any strike, work stoppage or other labor dispute involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened,
that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. There are no labor controversies pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.  There have been no claims initiated by any
labor organization to represent any Company Employees not currently
represented by a labor organization.

  



  

Section 5.14 _ Intellectual Property Matters_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use
all seismic data, patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights, trade
names, trade name rights, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets,
applications for trademarks and service marks, know-how and other proprietary
rights and information used or held for use in connection with the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, except where the
failure to own or possess such items, individually or in the aggregate, would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Companys
Knowledge, there is no assertion or claim challenging the validity of any of
the foregoing that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not and will not conflict in
any way with any seismic data license, patent, patent right, license,
trademark, trademark right, trade name, trade name right, copyright, service
mark, trade secret, know-how or other proprietary rights or information of
any third party that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

Section 5.15 _ Material Contracts_.

  



  

### (a) Section 5.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all
Contracts, other than Company Benefit Plans and oil and gas leases and
assignments entered into in the ordinary course of business, to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (i) relating to indebtedness
for borrowed money, (ii) that is a "material contract" (as such term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) that
obligates the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments or
issue or pay anything of value to any director, officer, key employee or
consultant, (iv) that limit or purport to limit the ability of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to compete in the U.S. domestic oil and gas
exploration, production and marketing business with any Person in any
geographic area or during any period of time, (v) that includes any material
indemnification, contribution or guarantee obligations (other than such
obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business in offshore oil
and gas operations), (vi) that relate to capital expenditures involving total
payments of more than $1 million, (vii) requiring annual or remaining
payments in excess of $1 million after the date hereof, (viii) that is a
seismic license agreement or rig or drilling contract material to the
Company, (ix) that is a fixed price commodity sales agreement with a
remaining term of more than 60 days, (x) that is a material Contract relating
to any of the properties specified in Section 5.15 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or (xi) that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any other Person. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received notice that any  party to any such Contract
is in default, and each such Contract, upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, shall
continue in full force and effect without penalty or other adverse
consequence (other than the termination or expiration thereof in accordance
with its terms, for reasons other than the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements).

  

### 

  

### (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default in any
respect under any Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of
its properties or assets is bound, which default, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and there has
not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice
or both, would constitute such a default.

  

### 

  

Section 5.16 _ Opinion of Company Financial Advisor_. The Company has
received the written opinion of Lehman Brothers Inc., to the effect that, as
of the date of such opinion, the Exchange Ratio (as defined in such opinion)
is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company.  The Company has
previously delivered a complete copy of such opinion to Forest.

  



  

Section 5.17 _ Brokers or Finders_. No agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other similar Person is or will be entitled, by reason
of any agreement, act or statement by the Company, or any of its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers or employees, to any financial advisory,
brokers, finders or similar fee or commission, to reimbursement of expenses
or to indemnification or contribution in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.18 _ Takeover Statutes_. The Board of Directors of the Company has
unanimously approved the terms of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger and the

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such approval
represents all the action necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement the
restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL
to the extent such restrictions would otherwise be applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.19 _ Certain Board Findings_. The Board of Directors of the
Company, at a meeting duly called and held, (i) has determined that the
Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders and (ii) has resolved, subject to Section 6.11, to recommend the
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company.

  



  

Section 5.20 _ Vote Required_. The only vote of the stockholders of the
Company required under any of the DGCL or the Companys Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation for adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to vote (sometimes referred to herein as the
"Requisite Approval").

  



  

Section 5.21 _ Certain Payments_. No Company Benefit Plan or employment
arrangement, and no contractual arrangements between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and any third party, exists that could result in the payment
to any current, former or future director, officer, stockholder or employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or of any entity the assets or
capital stock of which have been acquired by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary, of any money or other property or rights or accelerate or provide
any other rights or benefits to any such individual as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements whether or not (a) such payment, acceleration or provision
would constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code), or (b) some other subsequent action or event would be
required to cause such payment, acceleration or provision to be triggered.

  



  

Section 5.22 _Assets_. The Company has good and marketable title to all oil
and gas properties forming the basis for the reserves reflected in the
Company Reserve Report as attributable to interests owned by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary and has good and valid title to, or valid leasehold
interests or other contractual rights in, all other Company assets, with
respect to both the oil and gas properties and all other Company assets, free
and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens and Liens associated with
obligations reflected in the Company Reserve Report. The oil and gas
leases and other agreements that provide the Company and its Subsidiaries
with operating rights in the oil and gas properties reflected in the Company
Reserve Report are legal, valid and binding and in full force and effect, the
rentals, royalties and other payments due thereunder have been properly paid
and, to the Companys Knowledge, there is no existing default (or event that,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default) under any of
such oil and gas leases or other agreements, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries (as the case may be) have
maintained all of their respective assets owned on the date hereof in working
order and operating condition, subject only to ordinary wear and tear.

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

Section 5.23 _Loans_. Section 5.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth each currently outstanding loan exceeding $1 million in principal
amount made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person.

  



  

Section 5.24 _ Oil and Gas Reserves_. The Company has furnished to Forest
reserve reports prepared by the Company containing estimates of the oil and
gas reserves, as of December 31, 2004 and June 30, 2005 (collectively, the
"Company Reserve Report"), that are owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.  The factual, non-interpretive data on which the Company
Reserve Report was based for purposes of estimating the oil and gas reserves
set forth therein was accurate in all material respects, and to the Knowledge
of the Company no errors in such information existed at the time such
information was provided. The Company Reserve Report conforms to the
guidelines with respect thereto of the SEC. Except for changes (including
changes in hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally affecting the oil and gas
industry and normal depletion by production, there has been no change in
respect of the matters addressed in the Company Reserve Report that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Since January 1, 2003 all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries wells have
been drilled and (if completed) completed, operated and produced in
compliance in all respects with applicable oil and gas leases and applicable
laws, except where any such failure or violation would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Companys Knowledge, there are no wells
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries are (i) currently obligated by applicable law or Contract to
plug and abandon, or (ii) obligated by applicable law or Contract to plug
and abandon with the lapse of time or notice or both because the well is
not currently capable of producing in commercial quantities. No Person has
any call on, option to purchase or similar rights with respect to the
production of hydrocarbons attributable to any of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries assets, except any such call, option or similar right at market
prices.  Except for gas imbalances between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any third party working interest owners, marketers or
pipelines relative to its assets that have accrued since June 30, 2005,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is obligated by any gas
prepayment arrangement or by any "take-or-pay" requirement, advance payment
or other similar arrangement to deliver any gas at a future time without then
or thereafter receiving payment therefor. With respect to any oil and gas
interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are not operated by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company makes the representations and
warranties set forth in this Section 5.24 only to its Knowledge.

  



  

Section 5.25 _ Derivative Transactions_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has entered into any Derivative Transaction pursuant to which it
has a continuing financial liability or obligation. All Derivative
Transactions entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are
currently open were entered into in material compliance with applicable
rules, regulations and policies of all regulatory authorities.

  



  

Section 5.26 _ No Other Representations and Warranties_.  Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article V, Forest and Spinco
acknowledge that neither the Company nor any other Person makes any express
or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries or otherwise or with respect to any other information provided
to Forest or Spinco, whether on behalf of the Company or such other Persons.
Neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability or indemnification

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

obligation to Forest or Spinco or any other Person to the extent resulting
from the distribution to Forest or Spinco, or Forest or Spincos use of, any
information related to the Company and any other information, document or
material made available to Forest or Spinco in certain "data rooms,"
management presentations or in any other form in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

with respect to a class of capital stock all of which shares of capital stock
or partnership interests (with the exception of directors qualifying shares

of the applicable corporation or partnership are owned directly or indirectly
by the Company; (ii) split, combine or reclassify any of its capital stock

substantial equity interest in or a substantial portion of the assets of, or
by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or division thereof; provided,
however, that in any event, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of

would hinder in any material respect the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Dispositions_ _._  Subject to Section 6.11, and other than product
sales and other dispositions in connection with normal equipment maintenance
or salvage in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and Permitted Liens, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, in a single transaction or a series of related or unrelated

arrangement with any of their respective Affiliates (including any Company
Employees), other than with wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Company, on

liability companies, working interests or other investments where the Company
has the capacity to make such binding election, (ii) settle or compromise any

Section 6.8 _ Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

### (a) Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 6.8, Spinco and
the Company shall take all acts necessary to cause Spinco Employees who
remain employed by Spinco, the Company or their Subsidiaries from and after
the Effective Time ("Continuing Spinco Employees") to participate in the
Company Benefit Plans maintained by the Company as of the Effective Time on a
basis no less favorable than that applicable to similarly situated Company
Employees who remain employed by the Company or its Affiliates as of the
Effective Time (the "Continuing Company Employees"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Effective Time occurs in 2006, then Spinco and the
Company shall cause each Continuing Spinco Employee to receive vacation
benefits for the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on
December 31, 2006, that are equal to (i) such employees accrued and unused
vacation under Forests vacation policy as of the Effective Time plus (ii) if
the Companys vacation policy is more generous than Forests vacation policy
with respect to such Continuing Spinco Employee based on his years of service
recognized by Forest as of the Effective Time for purposes of such policy,
any additional vacation entitlement earned by such employee under the terms
of the Companys vacation policy. In the event the employment of a Spinco
Employee is terminated by Forest with the Companys consent prior to the
Effective Time (other than pursuant to a Termination for Cause), (i) such
employee shall not receive a Retention Benefit, (ii) Forest shall provide
such employee with the severance benefits described on _Exhibit E, Part B_
(provided such employee executes a release of claims in favor of Forest,
Spinco, the Company and their respective Affiliates (which release shall be
in a form agreed to by Forest, Spinco and the Company)), and (iii) as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Company shall reimburse Forest for
such severance benefits actually paid by Forest to such employee; provided
that the Company shall not be responsible for any reimbursement of severance
amounts paid to any such Spinco Employee who is subsequently re-hired by
Forest or any Forest Subsidiary during the six-month period following the
Effective Time (in which case Forest shall refund any reimbursement so made
by the Company).

  

### 

  

### (b) Neither Spinco nor the Company shall establish or maintain effective
as of the Effective Time (i) any plan providing supplemental executive
retirement benefits that is not an individual account plan, (ii) any plan
providing retiree medical benefits or (iii) any defined benefit pension plan.

  

### 

  

### (c) Spinco and the Company shall cause each Continuing Spinco Employee to
be given full credit for all service with Forest, Spinco and their Affiliates
before the Effective Time for all purposes under each Company Benefit Plan
(except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits). Such
service credit for each such purpose shall be in an amount equal to the
service credit recognized under the corresponding Spinco Benefit Plan as of
the Effective Time for such purpose. For purposes of determining the terms
and conditions of a Continuing Spinco Employees participation in any Company
Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan (the "Company Welfare
Plans"), the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive all
limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to the Continuing Spinco Employee or his or her dependents under the
Company Welfare Plans,

  

### 

  

### 56   

     
   

  

### 

  

### other than to the extent limitations or waiting periods that are already
in effect with respect to the Continuing Spinco Employee or his or her
dependents have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under the
corresponding welfare benefit plans maintained for the Continuing Spinco
Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each
Continuing Spinco Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid in the year of the Closing before the Effective Time in satisfying any
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Company Welfare Plans (on
a pro-rata basis in the event of a difference in plan years).

  

### 

  

### (d) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Forest shall
cause to be transferred from the trustee of Forests Retirement Savings Plan
(the "Forest Savings Plan") to the trustee of the Companys Employee Capital
Accumulation Plan (the "Company Savings Plan") an amount in cash equal to the
aggregate account balances of the Continuing Spinco Employees under the
Forest Savings Plan determined as of the transfer date; provided, however,
that to the extent any Continuing Spinco Employee owes any amount to the
Forest Savings Plan pursuant to the terms of a loan from such plan to such
Continuing Spinco Employee, an in-kind transfer of such loan shall be made in
addition to the transfer of cash for the remaining account balance. All
account investments (other than any such loan amounts), including investments
in shares of Forest Common Stock and/or Company Common Stock, shall be
converted to cash prior to the account transfer to the Company Savings Plan.
From and after the date of such transfer, Spinco and the Company shall cause
the Company Savings Plan to assume the obligations of the Forest Savings Plan
with respect to benefits accrued by the Continuing Spinco Employees under the
Forest Savings Plan, and the Forest Savings Plan shall cease to be
responsible therefor. Spinco, the Company and Forest shall cooperate in
making all appropriate arrangements and filings, if any, in connection with
the transfer described above.  Further, Spinco, the Company and Forest shall
cooperate and take such actions as are necessary to permit the continuation
of loan repayments by Continuing Spinco Employees to the Forest Savings Plan
by payroll deductions during the period beginning on the Effective Time and
ending on the date of the transfer described in this paragraph.  Forest
represents, covenants and agrees with respect to the Forest Savings Plan, and
the Company represents, covenants and agrees with respect to the Company
Savings Plan, that, as of the date of the transfer described in this
paragraph, such plan will satisfy the requirements of Code Sections 401(a),
(k), and (m) and will have received, or a pending application has been timely
filed for, a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding
such qualified status and covering amendments required to have been adopted
prior to the expiration of the GUST remedial amendment period.

  

### 

  

### (e) If, during the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on
the later of June 30, 2006 or the date which is six months after the
Effective Time (the "Retention Period"), the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company desires to relocate the principal place of employment of a Continuing
Spinco Employee (other than a scheduled rotational employee) by 50 miles or
more from the location of his principal place of employment immediately prior
to the Effective Time, then Spinco and the Company shall cause any such
employee who accepts such relocation to receive the relocation benefits
described on _Exhibit E, Part A_. If, during the Retention Period, (i)
a Continuing Spinco Employee voluntarily terminates his employment with
the Company and its Subsidiaries within 30 days after the date of a reduction
in his base salary or base wages from that in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) a Continuing Spinco Employee voluntarily terminates
his employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries after the date upon
which he is notified that the principal place of his employment is changing
to a

  

### 

  

### 57   

     
   

  

### 

  

### location that is 50 miles or more from the location of his principal
place of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided,
however, that if the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company permits the
employee to continue to work at his original location, then such termination
of employment may not occur prior to a date determined by the Company, which
date shall be no later than the last day of the Retention Period), or (iii)
the employment of a Continuing Spinco Employee is involuntarily terminated by
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company other than pursuant to a
Termination for Cause, then, in any such case, Spinco and the Company shall
cause such employee to receive the severance benefits described on _Exhibit
E, Part B_, provided (A) such employee executes a release of claims in favor
of Forest, Spinco, the Company and their respective Affiliates (which release
shall be in a form agreed to by Forest, Spinco and the Company), (B) such
employee is not subsequently re-hired by Forest or any Forest Subsidiary
during the Retention Period (in which case Forest shall refund any severance
so paid by the Company), and (C) the amount of such severance benefit paid to
such employee shall be reduced by the portion, if any, of such employees
Retention Benefit that was paid to such employee in accordance with Section
6.8(g). _Exhibit E, Part B_ sets forth the maximum aggregate severance amount
payable by the Company to the Continuing Spinco Employees pursuant to this
Section 6.8. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except
as specifically provided in the preceding provisions of this Section 6.8(e),
neither Spinco nor the Company shall be responsible for the payment of, or
reimbursement of Forest for, severance paid to any Spinco Employee who
voluntarily resigns employment from Spinco or the Company if such Spinco
Employee was not required to relocate in order to maintain such employment. No
Continuing Spinco Employee shall be eligible for severance pursuant to the
Companys severance plan at any time while the provisions of this Section
6.8(e) apply to such Continuing Spinco Employee.

  

### 

  

### (f) The Company shall implement in all material respects (without any
enhancement) the agreements with its officers described in Section 6.8(f) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company shall obtain the written
agreement of the officers described in Section 6.8(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule on or before the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (g) In lieu of the payment of any annual bonuses for 2005 to the
Continuing Spinco Employees under the annual incentive and bonus plans
maintained by Forest, the Company and Spinco shall provide the Continuing
Spinco Employees with the retention benefits described in this Section
6.8(g). Each Continuing Spinco Employees aggregate potential retention
benefit ("Retention Benefit") shall be in an amount equal to 250% of such
employees target annual bonus for 2005 under the annual incentive or bonus
plan maintained by Forest and applicable to such employee (with such target
annual bonus determined as of the Effective Time based upon such Continuing
Spinco Employees annual base salary in effect as of such time). Retention
Benefits shall be paid by Spinco (prior to the Effective Time) or the Company
(after the Effective Time) in four installments, the first of which will
equal 25% of the employees target annual bonus for 2005, and the remaining
three of which will each equal 75% of the employees target annual bonus for
2005; provided, however, that (i) any payment of an installment of a
Retention Benefit prior to the Effective Time shall be made to each
individual who is a Spinco Employee on the date of the payment of such
installment and such payment shall be based on such Spinco Employees annual
base salary in effect on such payment date and (ii) if such Spinco Employees
annual base salary changes between the date of any such payment and the
Effective Time, the first installment of a Retention Benefit paid to such
employee on or after the

  

### 

  

### 58   

     
   

  

### 

  

### Effective Time shall be adjusted so that, immediately after the payment
of such installment, the employee will have received the correct amount of
his or her Retention Benefit through the date of payment of such installment
determined based on his or her annual base salary in effect as of the
Effective Time. The first such installment shall be paid on October 14, 2005,
the second such installment shall be paid on February 15, 2006, the third
such installment shall be paid on May 1, 2006, and the fourth such
installment shall be paid on June 30, 2006. Retention Benefits shall be
subject to applicable withholding of taxes.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
except as hereinafter provided, in order for a Continuing Spinco Employee to
be eligible to receive an installment payment of his or her Retention
Benefit, such Continuing Spinco Employee must remain in the employ of the
Company, Spinco or any of their Subsidiaries with at least a satisfactory
performance rating until the date of the payment of such installment. If the
employment of a Continuing Spinco Employee is involuntarily terminated after
the Effective Time by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (other than
pursuant to a Termination for Cause), then, in addition to any severance
benefit to which such employee may be entitled pursuant to Section 6.8(e),
the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to such employee, within 10 days
after the date of such termination of employment, an amount equal to the next
unpaid installment, if any, of such employees Retention Benefit that would
have been paid to such employee if his or her employment had not terminated;
provided, that in no event shall any such involuntarily terminated Continuing
Spinco Employee receive less (in the aggregate) than 100% of such employees
target annual bonus for 2005 pursuant to this Section 6.8(g), unless the
employment of such Continuing Spinco Employee was terminated pursuant to a
Termination for Cause. If a Continuing Spinco Employee voluntarily terminates
his or her employment after the Effective Time or if the employment of a
Continuing Spinco Employee is involuntarily terminated after the
Effective Time by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company pursuant to a
Termination for Cause, then no further installments of such employees
Retention Benefit shall be paid to such employee.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, neither Spinco nor the Company shall be
responsible for the payment of, or reimbursement of Forest for, Retention
Benefits in excess of the aggregate amount set forth on _Exhibit E, Part C_.

### (h) The Company hereby acknowledges that it consents to, and shall cause
any action required on its behalf to implement, the transactions and
agreements contemplated by the Employee Benefits Agreement.

the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination
Date, to its and its Subsidiaries plants, properties, Contracts,

environmental information, as to its and its Subsidiaries respective
businesses and properties as the other or its duly authorized

representatives thereunder and hereunder. No investigation made at any time

affect the representations and warranties of the parties hereto.

Spinco, the Company and Merger Sub shall use all commercially reasonable

waivers to effect all necessary registrations and filings and to lift any
injunction or other legal bar to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby as promptly as practicable, and to take all
other actions necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby in a manner consistent with applicable law. Without limiting

(including through any required compliance with the HSR Act and any
applicable foreign government reporting requirements) and to respond to any

antitrust or fair trade law.

  

### 

  

### (b) Subject to Section 6.10(a), in case at any time any further action is
reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Forest,
Spinco and the Company shall take all such commercially reasonable necessary
action.

  

### 

  

Section 6.11 _ No Solicitation by the Company_.

  



  

### (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that

any person or entity with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect to
itself, except as to the existence of these provisions, (iv) approve, endorse

extent specifically permitted pursuant to Section 6.11 and Section 8.1(g)),
or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Proposal or transaction contemplated thereby with respect to
itself (except as permitted pursuant

  

### 

  

### 60   

     
   

  

### 

  

### to Section 6.11 and Section 8.1(g)).  The Company and its Subsidiaries
shall, and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or
any of its Subsidiaries) to, immediately cease any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect to itself.
The Company shall ensure that its officers, directors and key employees and
its investment bankers, attorneys and other representatives are aware of the

### (b) (i) As promptly as practicable after receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry which it
reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall
provide Forest and Spinco with oral and written notice of the material terms

the identity of the person, entity or Acquisition Group making any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and a copy of all written materials

Upon receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the Company

subsequently provided to the person making the Acquisition Proposal in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry to the extent
not previously provided to Forest and Spinco.

  

### 

  

#### (ii) The Company shall provide Forest and Spinco with forty eight (48)
hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members
of its Board of Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which
its Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition
Proposal.

  

#### 

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.11
and under circumstances in which the Company has complied with all of its
obligations under Section 6.11(a) and (b), in the event that, prior to the
approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company
as provided herein, the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal with respect to itself from a third party that its Board
of Directors has in good faith concluded (following the receipt of the advice
of its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) is, or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Superior Offer, it may then take the following
actions: (i) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such

expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of this Section
6.11) and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any material nonpublic
information to such third

  

### 

  

### 61

negotiations with such third party, it gives Forest and Spinco written notice
of its intention to enter into negotiations with such third party.

  

### 

  

### (d) In response to the receipt of a Superior Offer, the Board of
Directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or propose
or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify, its recommendation in favor of the
Merger, and, in the case of a Superior Offer that is a tender or exchange
offer made directly to its stockholders, may recommend that its stockholders
accept the tender or exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions, whether by

if all of the following conditions in clauses (i) through (iv) are met: (i) a
Superior Offer with respect to it has been made and has not been withdrawn;
(ii) approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company as provided herein has not occurred; (iii) it shall have (A) provided

### 

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
and subject to Section 2.4, the obligation of the Company to call, give
notice of, convene and hold its stockholders meeting as contemplated in
Section 2.4 shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement,

of its outside legal counsel and its financial adviser) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a

  

### 

  

### 62   

     
   

  

### 

  

### Superior Offer. Without limiting the foregoing sentence, the Company
shall not make a Change of Recommendation to recommend that its stockholders
accept a tender or exchange offer unless specifically permitted pursuant to
the terms of Section 6.11.

  

### 

  

### (g) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings: (i) "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, offer
or proposal relating to any transaction or series of related transactions
involving: (A) any purchase from the Company or acquisition by any person,
entity or "Acquisition Group" (as "Group" is defined under Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more than a
fifteen percent (15%) interest in the total outstanding voting securities of
the Company or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person, entity or Acquisition Group beneficially owning fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the total outstanding voting securities of the
Company or any merger, consolidation, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company, (B) any sale, lease (other than in the
ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the

Company on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company has in good faith
concluded (following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel and
its financial adviser), taking into account, among other things, all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the offer and the person, entity
or Acquisition Group making the offer, to be more favorable, from a financial
point of view, to the Companys stockholders (in their capacities as
stockholders) than the terms of the Merger and is reasonably capable of being
consummated.

  

### 

  

Section 6.12 _ Director and Officer Indemnification; Insurance_.

  



  

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, Spinco shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law each
person who is, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an
officer or director of the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company and
each person who served at the request of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as a director, officer, trustee, partner, employee, agent or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (individually, an "Indemnified
Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement with approval of
the indemnifying party (which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or
withheld) in connection with any Action arising out of or pertaining to acts
or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as
such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective
Time.  In the event of any such Action:  (i) Spinco shall pay, as incurred,
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Spinco, in advance of
the final disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law and, if required, upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable law, and (ii) Spinco will cooperate in the defense of any such
Action; provided, however, Spinco shall not

  

### 

  

### 63   

     
   

  

### 

  

### be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and provided further,
that Spinco shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.12(a) to pay
the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in a single Action, unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the
Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict of interests between two
or more of such Indemnified Parties, in which case there may be separate
counsel for each similarly situated group (which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to Spinco). In the event of any Action, any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification will promptly notify Spinco thereof
(provided, that failure to so notify Spinco will not affect the obligations
of Spinco except to the extent that Spinco shall have been materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Section 6.12 shall be deemed to grant any right to
any Indemnified Party which is not permitted to be granted to an officer
or director of Spinco under Delaware law, assuming for such purposes that
Spincos Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide for the maximum
indemnification permitted by law.

  

### 

  

### (b) Without limiting the rights that any indemnified person may have
under applicable law, the parties agree that all rights of indemnification
existing as of the date hereof as provided in the respective charter and
bylaws of the Company and Spinco shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

  

### 

  

### (c) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Spinco shall
cause to be maintained directors and officers liability insurance policies
covering the Indemnified Parties who are or at any time prior to the
Effective Time were covered by the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance policies on terms substantially no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than such insurance with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred up to and including the
Effective Time to the extent available; provided, however, that Spinco may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the covered
persons; provided further, that Spinco shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for such insurance in excess of 500% of the last annual premium paid
by the Company prior to the date hereof and, if such insurance is not
available within such limit, Spinco shall be required to obtain only such
insurance as is available within such limit.

  

### 

  

### (d) This Section 6.12 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
personal representatives, and shall be binding on Spinco and the Company and
their respective successors and assigns. In the event Spinco or the Company
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Spinco or the Company, as the case may be, honor the indemnification
obligations set forth in this Section 6.12.

  

### 

  

Section 6.13 _ Rule 145 Affiliates_. Spinco shall, at least 10 days prior to
the Effective Time, cause to be delivered to the Company a list, reviewed by
its counsel, identifying all persons who, in its reasonable judgment, are at
such time, or will be at the Effective Time, "affiliates" of Spinco for
purposes of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act

  



  

64   

     
   

  



  

(each, a "Rule 145 Affiliate"). Spinco shall furnish such information
and documents as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of
reviewing such list. Spinco shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each person who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in the list
furnished pursuant to this Section 6.13 to execute a written agreement (each,
a "Rule 145 Affiliate Agreement"), substantially in the form of _Exhibit
F _to this Agreement, at or prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 6.14 _ Public Announcements_.  Except with respect to a Change in
Recommendation, Forest and the Company shall consult with each other and
shall mutually agree upon any press release or public announcement relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and neither of them shall
issue any such press release or make any such public announcement prior to
such consultation and agreement, except as may be required by applicable law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public announcement shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement.

  



  

Section 6.15 _ Defense of Litigation_. Each of Forest, Spinco, the Company
and Merger Sub shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to defend
against all Actions in which such party is named as a defendant that
challenge or otherwise seek to enjoin, restrain or prohibit the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or seek damages with respect to such
transactions. None of Forest, Spinco, the Company or Merger Sub shall settle
any such Action or fail to perfect on a timely basis any right to appeal any
judgment rendered or order entered against such party therein without having
previously consulted with the other parties. Each of Forest, Spinco and the
Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its
Affiliates, directors and officers to use all commercially reasonable efforts
to defend any such Action in which such Affiliate, director or officer is
named as a defendant and which seeks any such relief to comply with
this Section 6.15 to the same extent as if such Person was a party.

  



  

Section 6.16 _Notification_.

  



  

### (a) From time to time prior to the Effective Time, each of Forest, Spinco
and the Company shall supplement or amend its respective Disclosure Schedule

Section 9.4 _ Certain Construction Rules_. The article and section headings
and the table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, unless otherwise provided to
the contrary, (a) all references to days or months shall be deemed

  



  

75   

     
   

  



  

references to calendar days or months and (b) any reference to a
"Section," "Article," "Exhibit" or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to a
section or article of this Agreement or an exhibit or schedule to this
Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless otherwise specifically
provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive.
Any matter disclosed in any particular Section or Subsection of the
Spinco Disclosure Schedule, the Forest Disclosure Schedule or the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed in any other
Section or Subsection of Articles III, IV, V or VI of this Agreement, as
applicable, with respect to which such matter is relevant so long as the
applicability of such matter to such Section or Subsection is reasonably
apparent. For avoidance of doubt, "consistent with past practice" when used
with respect to Spinco, any of its Subsidiaries, any Spinco Asset or the
Spinco Business shall mean the past practice of Forest.

  



  

Section 9.5 _ Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be
declared judicially to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall
not have the effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this
Agreement, it being the intent and agreement of Spinco, Forest, the Company
and Merger Sub that this Agreement shall be deemed amended by modifying such
provision to the extent necessary to render it valid, legal and enforceable
while preserving its intent or, if such modification is not possible, by
substituting therefor another provision that is legal and enforceable and
that achieves the same objective.

  



  

Section 9.6 _ Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned by Spinco,
Forest, the Company or Merger Sub (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of all of the other parties. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by Spinco, Forest, the Company and Merger Sub and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

Section 9.7 _ No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Sections
2.2, 2.8, 2.9 and 6.12 (collectively, the "Third Party Provisions"), nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
any Person (other than Forest, Spinco and the Company and their respective
successors and permitted assigns) any legal or equitable right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, and no
Person (other than as so specified) shall be deemed a third party beneficiary
under or by reason of this Agreement. The Third Party Provisions may be
enforced by the beneficiaries thereof after the Effective Time. Subject
to Section 6.12, Spinco shall reimburse all expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that are incurred by any Person who prevails in
any litigation or other proceeding required to enforce the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation and Spinco under the Third Party Provisions.

  



  

Section 9.8 _ Limited Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, no stockholder, director, officer, Affiliate, agent
or representative of Spinco, Forest, the Company or Merger Sub, in its
capacity as such, shall have any liability in respect of or relating to the
covenants, obligations, representations or warranties of such party under
this Agreement or

  



  

76   

     
   

  



  

in respect of any certificate delivered with respect hereto or thereto and,
to the fullest extent legally permissible, each of Spinco, Forest,
the Company and Merger Sub, for itself and its stockholders, directors,
officers and Affiliates, waives and agrees not to seek to assert or enforce
any such liability that any such Person otherwise might have pursuant to
applicable law.

  



  

Section 9.9 _ Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the other
Transaction Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and the
Disclosure Schedules and the other documents delivered pursuant
hereto) constitutes the entire agreement of all the parties hereto and
supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. All exhibits attached to this Agreement and the
Disclosure Schedules are expressly made a part of, and incorporated by
reference into, this Agreement.  Each section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Forest Disclosure Schedule and the Spinco Disclosure Schedule
qualifies the corresponding numbered representation and warranty or covenant
to the extent specified therein, and any other representation, warranty or
covenant to which such matter is relevant so long as the applicability of
such matter to any such representation, warranty or covenant is reasonably
apparent.

  



  

Section 9.10 _ Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to the conflicts of law principles thereof. EACH OF THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY (i) AGREES
TO BE SUBJECT TO, AND HEREBY CONSENTS AND SUBMITS TO, THE JURISDICTION OF THE
COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND OF THE FEDERAL COURTS SITTING IN THE
STATE OF DELAWARE, (ii) TO THE EXTENT SUCH PARTY IS NOT OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO
SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, HEREBY APPOINTS THE CORPORATION
TRUST COMPANY, AS SUCH PARTYS AGENT IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE FOR ACCEPTANCE
OF LEGAL PROCESS AND (iii) AGREES THAT SERVICE MADE ON ANY SUCH AGENT SET
FORTH IN (ii) ABOVE SHALL HAVE THE SAME LEGAL FORCE AND EFFECT AS IF SERVED
UPON SUCH PARTY PERSONALLY WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one agreement binding on Spinco, Forest, the
Company and Merger Sub, notwithstanding that not all parties are signatories
to the original or the same counterpart.

  



  

Section 9.12 _ Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this
Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.

  



  

Section 9.13 _ Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives all right to trial by jury in any
Action or counterclaim (whether based in contract, tort or otherwise) arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in
the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof.

  



  

77   

     
   

  



  

Section 9.14 _ Confidentiality_. Subject to Section 7.2 and Section 7.5 of
the Distribution Agreement, for a period of eighteen months following the
Effective Time, each of Forest and the Company shall hold, and shall cause
its Affiliates and Representatives to hold, in strict confidence all
Information concerning the other party and its Affiliates obtained by it
prior to the Effective Date or furnished to it by such other party and its
Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements
(including, with respect to Forest and its Affiliates and Representatives,
Information of Forest, its Affiliates and Representatives to the extent
related to Spinco, the Spinco Assets or the Spinco Business) and shall not
release or disclose such Information to any other Person, except its
Affiliates and Representatives, who shall be advised of the provisions of
this Section 9.14, and shall not use such Information except as required
pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreements, and each party shall be
responsible for a breach by any of its Affiliates or Representatives;
provided, however, that any member of the Forest Group or the Company and its
Affiliates may disclose such Information to the extent that (a) disclosure is
compelled by judicial or administrative process or, based on advice of such
Persons counsel, by other requirements of law, or (b) such party can show
that such Information was (i) in the public domain through no fault of such
Person or (ii) lawfully acquired by such Person from another source after the
time that it was furnished to such Person by the other party or its
Affiliates, and not acquired from such source subject to any confidentiality
obligation on the part of such source known to the acquiror. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of Forest and the Company shall be deemed to have
satisfied its obligations under this Section 9.14 with respect to any
Information (other than Privileged Information) if it exercises the same care
with regard to such Information as it takes to preserve confidentiality for
its own similar Information.

  



  

78   

     
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the
date first above written.

Section 1. Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to
time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized (i)
to provide by resolution or resolutions from time to time for the issuance of
shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, (ii) to establish from time
to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, (iii) (to
the extent not expressly provided for herein) to fix the designations,
powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations
or restrictions, if any, thereof, by filing on or more certificates pursuant
to the DGCL (hereinafter, referred to as a "Preferred

  



  

C-2   

     
   

  



  

Stock Designation"), and (iv) to increase or decrease the number of shares of
any such series to the extent permitted by the DGCL and the Preferred Stock
Designation (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding).
The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each series shall
include, but not be limited to, determination of the following:

  



  

a) The designation of the series, which may be by distinguishing the number,
letter or title of such series.

  



  

b) The number of shares of the series.

  



  

c) Whether dividends, if any, shall be paid in cash or in capital stock or
other securities, whether such dividends shall be cumulative (and, if so,
from which date or dates for each such series) or noncumulative, the
preference or relation which such dividends, if any, shall bear to the
dividends payable on any other class or classes or any other series of
capital stock, and the dividend rate, if any, of the series.

  



  

d) Conditions and dates upon which dividends, if any, shall be payable.

  



  

e) The redemption rights and redemption price or prices, if any, for shares
of

or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.

  



  

h) Whether the shares of the series shall be convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of any other class or series of capital stock, or any other
security, of the Corporation or any other corporation and, if so, the
specification of such other class or series or such other security, the

thereof, the date or dates at which such shares shall be convertible or

exchange may be made.

  



  

i) Restrictions on the issuance of shares of the same series or of any other
class or series.

  



  

j) The voting rights, if any, of the holders of shares of the series, whether
as a class or otherwise, with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.

  



  

C-3   

     
   

  



  

 _k)_ The price or other consideration for which shares of the series shall
be issued and, if deemed desirable, the stated value or other valuation of
the shares constituting such series.

  



  

 _l)_ Any other relative rights, preferences and limitations of that series.

  



  

Section 2. Common Stock.

  



  

(a) General. All shares of Common Stock shall be identical and will entitle
holders thereof to the same rights and privileges, except as otherwise
provided herein. Subject to the prior rights and preferences, if any,
applicable to shares of the Preferred Stock or any series thereof, the
holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends
(payable in cash, stock, or otherwise) as may be declared thereon by the
Board of Directors at any time and from time to time out of any funds of the
Corporation legally available therefore.

  



  

(b) Voting Rights.

each share of Common Stock held by such holder.

  



  

(ii) Except as otherwise provided by law, each registered holder of Common

Corporation as provided for in Section 2 of Article Five of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and shall be entitled to
vote on all other matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the
Corporation.

  



  

(c) Dividends. Any dividend or distribution on Common Stock shall be payable
on shares of Common Stock ratably.

  



  

(d) Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution, or winding-up of the Corporation, after distribution in full of
the preferential amounts, if any, to be distributed to the holders of shares
of Preferred Stock or any series thereof, the holders of shares of Common
Stock shall be entitled to receive all of the remaining assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, ratably in
proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock held by them. A
liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Corporation, as such terms are
used in this paragraph (d), shall not be deemed to be occasioned by or to
include any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into any other
corporation or corporations or other entity or a sale, lease, exchange, or
conveyance of all or a part of the assets of the Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE FIVE: Directors. The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall
consist of such number of directors as may be determined from time to time by
the Board of Directors in its sole discretion in accordance with Article III
of the Bylaws of the Corporation; subject, however, to the rights of the
holders of any series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation,

  



  

C-4   

     
   

  



  

as set forth in a Preferred Stock Designation, to elect additional Directors
under specified circumstances and shall be subject to the following
provisions:

  



  

Section 1. Classification. The directors shall be divided into three classes
as nearly equal in size as is practicable, hereby designated Class I, Class
II and Class III. The term of office of the initial Class I directors shall
expire on the date of the first annual meeting of stockholders following
adoption of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation by
the affirmative vote of the stockholders (the "Effective Time"), the term of
office of the initial Class II directors shall expire at the second annual
meeting of the stockholders after the Effective Time and the term of office
of the initial Class III directors shall expire at the third annual meeting
of the stockholders after the Effective Time. At each annual stockholders
meeting after the Effective Time, directors to replace those of a class whose
terms expire at such annual meeting shall be elected to hold office until the
third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected and qualified.  If the number of
directors is hereafter changed, any newly created directorships or decrease
in directorships shall be so apportioned among the classes as to make all
classes as nearly equal in number as is practicable.

  



  

Section 2. Election. Holders of Common Stock shall elect all directors of the
Corporation (other than directors, if any, which holders of any series of
Preferred Stock are entitled to elect pursuant to the provisions of the
Preferred Stock Designation establishing such series).

  



  

Section 3. Written Ballot. The election of directors need not be by written
ballot except as may otherwise be provided in the Bylaws.

  



  

Section 4. Cumulative Voting: Cumulative voting for the election of directors
is not allowed.

  



  

Section 5. Removal. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock to remove directors under specified circumstances, (i) no
director may be removed without cause and (ii) the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of all of the
then-outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, shall be required to remove any director or the entire Board of
Directors for cause.

  



  

ARTICLE SIX: Bylaws. The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt,
amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. Any adoption, amendment or
repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the Board of Directors shall
require the approval of a majority of the total number of authorized
directors regardless of whether there exist any vacancies in such authorized
directorships. The stockholders shall also have the power to adopt, amend or
repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that, in addition to
any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the
Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of
at least

  



  

C-5   

     
   

  



  

eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding
shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be
required to adopt, amend or repeal any provision of the Bylaws of
the Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE SEVEN: Action Without a Meeting. Any action required or permitted to
be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly
called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may
not be effected by any consent in writing by such stockholders.

  



  

ARTICLE EIGHT: Vacancies. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series
of Preferred Stock then outstanding, newly created directorships resulting
from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in
the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal from office or other cause shall, unless otherwise
required by law or by resolution of the Board of Directors, be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, though less
than a quorum (and not by stockholders), and directors so chosen shall hold
office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders
and until such directors successor shall have been duly elected and
qualified. No decrease in the authorized number of directors shall shorten
the term of any incumbent director.

  



  

ARTICLE NINE: Arrangements with Creditors. Whenever a compromise or
arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and its creditors or any
class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or
any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of
Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of the Corporation or of
any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or
receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of Section 291
of the DGCL or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any
receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of
Section 279 of the DGCL, order a meeting of the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said
court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of
the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of
stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise
or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence
of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the
said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said
application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of
creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the
Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE TEN: Section 203. The Corporation elects not to be governed by
Section 203 of the DGCL until the first date on which MEI Acquisitions
Holdings, LLC and its current (as of the Effective Time) and future
Affiliates (as defined in Article Thirteen of this Third Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation) cease to beneficially own fifteen percent (15%)
or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of the capital
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors, at which time Section 203 of the DGCL shall apply to
the Corporation.

  



  

C-6   

     
   

  



  

ARTICLE ELEVEN: Liability of Directors. No director of the Corporation shall
be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for
breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any
breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174
of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit. If the DGCL hereafter is amended to authorize the
further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on
personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the amended DGCL. Any repeal or modification of this Article
Eleven by the stockholders of the Corporation shall be prospective only, and
shall not adversely affect any limitation on the personal liability of a
director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal
or modification.

  



  

ARTICLE TWELVE: Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify, to the full
extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware as from time to time in

Corporation is authorized to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL.

Corporate Opportunity or otherwise is then exploiting any Corporate
Opportunity, the Corporation shall have no interest in, and no expectation
that, such Corporate Opportunity be offered to it, any such interest or

Opportunity for the Groups (and its officers, directors, agents,
stockholders, members, partners, Affiliates or Subsidiaries) own account
and benefit; or to recommend, assign, or otherwise transfer or deal in such
Corporate Opportunity to Persons other than the Corporation or any Affiliate

such Corporate Opportunity to another Person, or does not
communicate information regarding such Corporate Opportunity to the
Corporation; provided, however, that nothing in this Article Thirteen shall

confidential information of the Corporation or prohibit the Corporation from
pursuing any Corporate Opportunity.

Unless otherwise required by law or provided in the certificate of
incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws, (i) the holders of a
majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any
meeting of stockholders for the transaction of business, (ii) in all matters
other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of such stock so present or represented at any meeting of
stockholders at which a quorum is present shall constitute the act of the
stockholders, and (iii) where a separate vote by a class or classes is
required, a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes,
present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled
to take action with respect to that vote on that matter and the affirmative

duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a

Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present
in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the

Notwithstanding the other provisions of the certificate of incorporation of
the Corporation or these Bylaws, the chairman of the meeting or the holders
of a majority of the issued and outstanding stock, present in person or

that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.

  



  

 _Section 2.3_ _Annual Meetings_

  



  

An annual meeting of the stockholders, for the election of directors to
succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other
business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place
(within or without the state of incorporation of the Corporation), on such
date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall fix and set forth in
the notice of the meeting, which date shall be within thirteen (13) months
subsequent to the last annual meeting of stockholders.

  



  

 _Section 2.4_ _Special Meetings_

  



  

Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation of the
Corporation, special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes
may be called at any time by the Board of Directors acting pursuant to a
resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors
regardless of whether there exist any vacancies in such authorized
directorships, and not by stockholders, at such time and at such place as may

meeting shall be confined to the purpose(s) stated in the notice of such
meeting.

  



  

 _Section 2.5_ _Record Date_

  



  

For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at any meeting of stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors of the Corporation may fix a date as the
record date for any such determination of stockholders, which record date
shall not precede the date on which the resolutions fixing the record date
are adopted and which record date shall not be more than sixty

  



  

D-3   

     
   

  



  

(60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting of
stockholders, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action to
which such record date relates.

  



  

If the Board of Directors does not fix a record date for any meeting of
the stockholders, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at such meeting shall be at the close of business on the
day immediately preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if in
accordance with Article VIII, Section 3 of these Bylaws notice is waived, at
the close of business on the day immediately preceding the day on which the
meeting is held. The record date for determining stockholders for any other
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided,
however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

  



  

 _Section 2.6_ _Notice of Meetings_

  



  

Written notice of the place, date and hour of all meetings, and, in the case
of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the special meeting
is called, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat not
less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of
the meeting. Such notice may be delivered either personally or by mail. If
mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholders address as it
appears on the records of the Corporation.

  



  

 _Section 2.7_ _Nomination of Directors_

  



  

Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures
shall be eligible for election as directors, except as otherwise provided in
Article Eight of the Certificate of Incorporation. Nominations of persons for
election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be made at a
meeting of stockholders (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors
or (b) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record
at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section, who shall be
entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting and who
complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section. Such
nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the
Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholders notice shall be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation (i) with respect to an election of directors to be held at the
annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, not later than
one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the proxy
statement for the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders of
the Corporation, and (ii) with respect to an election of directors to be
held at a special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, not later than
the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice
of the date of the special meeting was first mailed to the Corporations
stockholders or public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was
first made, whichever first occurs. Such stockholders notice to the
Secretary shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes
to nominate for election or re-election as a director, all information
relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for
proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, pursuant to
Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(including the written consent of

  



  

D-4   

     
   

  



  

such person to be named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serve as a
director if elected); and (b) as to the stockholder giving the notice (i) the
name and address, as they appear on the Corporations books, of such
stockholder, and (ii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the
Corporation that are beneficially owned by the stockholder. At the request of
any officer of the Corporation, any person nominated by the Board of
Directors for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the
Corporation the information required to be set forth in a
stockholders notice of nomination that pertains to the nominee.

  



  

In the event that a person is validly designated as nominee to the Board and
shall thereafter become unable or unwilling to stand for election to the
Board of Directors, the Board of Directors or the stockholder who proposed
such nominee, as the case may be, may designate a substitute nominee. Except
as otherwise provided in Article Eight of the Certificate of Incorporation,
no person shall be eligible to serve as a director of the Corporation unless
nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section. The
chairman of the meeting of stockholders shall, if the facts warrant,
determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in
accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Bylaws, and if the chairman
should so determine, the chairman shall so declare to the meeting and the
defective nomination shall be disregarded.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a stockholder shall
also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to
the matters set forth in this Section 7.

  



  

 _Section 2.8_ _Business to be Brought Before a Meeting of Stockholders_

  



  

To be properly brought before a meeting of stockholders, business must be
either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto)
given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise brought
before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (c)
otherwise properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder of the
Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice
provided for in this Section, who shall be entitled to vote at such annual
meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this
Section. In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be
brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder of the Corporation, the
stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary
of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to
or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation,
not less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of
the proxy statement for the preceding annual meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation. A stockholders notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to
each matter (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the
annual meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the
Corporations books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the
acquisition date, the class and the number of shares of voting stock of the
Corporation which are owned beneficially by the stockholder, (iv) any
material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (v) a
representation that the stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy
at the annual meeting to bring the proposed business before the meeting.

 _Section 2.9_ _Stockholder List_

  



  

A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order for each class of stock and
showing the address of each such stockholder and the number of shares
registered in the name of such stockholder, shall be open to the examination
of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary
business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting,
either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which
place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so
specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.

  



  

The stockholder list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of
the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any
stockholder who is present.

  



  

 _Section 2.10_ _Proxies_

  



  

Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize
another person or persons to act for him by proxy.  Proxies for use at any
meeting of stockholders shall be filed with the Secretary, or such other
officer as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine by
resolution, before or at the time of the meeting. All proxies shall be
received and taken charge of and all ballots shall be received and canvassed
by the secretary of the meeting, who shall decide all questions touching upon
the qualification of voters, the validity of the proxies, and the acceptance
or rejection of votes, unless an inspector or inspectors shall have been
appointed by the chairman of the meeting, in which event such inspector
or inspectors shall decide all such questions.

  



  

No proxy shall be valid after three (3) years from its date, unless the
proxy provides for a longer period. Each proxy shall be revocable unless
expressly provided therein to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.

  



  

Should a proxy designate two or more persons to act as proxies, unless such
instrument shall provide the contrary, a majority of such persons present at
any meeting at which their powers thereunder are to be exercised shall have
and may exercise all the powers of voting thereby conferred, or if only one
be present, then such powers may be exercised by that one; or, if an even
number attend and a majority do not agree on any particular issue, each proxy
so attending shall be entitled to exercise such powers in respect of such
portion of the shares as is equal to the reciprocal of the fraction equal to
the number of proxies representing such shares divided by the total number of
shares represented by such proxies.

  



  

 _Section 2.11_ _Voting; Elections; Inspectors_

  



  

Unless otherwise required by law or provided in the certificate of
incorporation of the Corporation, each stockholder shall on each matter
submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders have one vote for each share
of the stock entitled to vote which is registered in his name on the record
date for the meeting. For the purposes hereof, each election to fill a
directorship shall constitute a separate matter. Shares registered in the
name of another entity, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer,
agent or proxy as the organizational documents of such entity may determine.
Shares registered in the name of a deceased person may be voted by the
executor or administrator of such persons estate, either in person or by
proxy. All voting, except as required by the certificate of incorporation of
the Corporation or

  



  

D-6   

     
   

  



  

where otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; provided, however,
upon request of the chairman of the meeting or upon demand therefor
by stockholders holding a majority of the issued and outstanding stock
present in person or by proxy at any meeting a stock vote shall be taken.
Every stock vote shall be taken by written ballots, each of which shall state
the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may
be required under the procedure established for the meeting. All elections of
directors shall be by written ballots, unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation of the Corporation.

  



  

At any meeting at which a vote is taken by written ballots, the chairman of
the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors, each of whom shall subscribe
an oath or affirmation to execute faithfully the duties of inspector at
such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of such
inspectors ability. Such inspector shall receive the written ballots, count
the votes, and make and sign a certificate of the result thereof. The
chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to serve as inspector, except
no candidate for the office of director shall be appointed as an inspector.

  



  

Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation of the
Corporation, cumulative voting for the election of directors shall be
prohibited.

  



  

 _Section 2.12_ _Conduct of Meetings_

  



  

The meetings of the stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of
the Board or such other officer of the Corporation as designated by the
Chairman of the Board or the Board of Directors. The Secretary of the
Corporation, if present, shall act as secretary of such meetings, or, if the
Secretary is not present, such other officer of the Corporation as designated
by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting shall so act.

  



  

The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of
business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the
manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to the chairman in
order.

  



  

 _Section 2.13_ _Treasury Stock_

  



  

The Corporation shall not vote, directly or indirectly, shares of its own
stock owned by it and such shares shall not be counted for quorum purposes.

  



  

Nothing in this Section 13 shall be construed as limiting the right of
the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock,
held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  

# ** **

  

 _Section 3.1_ _Power; Number; Term of Office_

  



  

The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under
the direction of the Board of Directors, and, subject to the restrictions
imposed by law or the certificate of

  



  

D-7   

     
   

  



  

incorporation of the Corporation, the Board of Directors may exercise all the
powers of the Corporation.

  



  

Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation of the
Corporation, the number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board
of Directors shall be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors
(provided that no decrease in the number of directors which would have the
effect of shortening the term of an incumbent director may be made by the
Board of Directors). If the Board of Directors makes no such determination,
the number of directors shall be three. Each director shall hold office for
the term for which such director is elected, and until such directors
successor shall have been elected and qualified or until such directors
earlier death, resignation or removal.

  



  

The Board of Directors may elect one of its members to serve as the Chairman
of the Board. If elected, the Chairman of the Board shall have such powers
and duties as designated in these Bylaws and as from time to time may be
assigned to him or her by the Board of Directors.

  



  

Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation of the
Corporation, directors need not be stockholders nor residents of the state of
incorporation of the Corporation.

  



  

 _Section 3.2_ _Quorum; Voting_

  



  

Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation of the
Corporation, a quorum of the Board of Directors shall be deemed to be present
at any meeting if a majority of the total number of directors are present at
the meeting. The vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at
which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors.

  



  

 _Section 3.3_ _Place of Meetings; Order of Business_

  



  

The directors may hold their meetings and may have an office and keep the
books of the Corporation, except as otherwise provided by law, in such place
or places, within or without the state of incorporation of the Corporation,
as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. At all meetings of
the Board of Directors business shall be transacted in such order as shall
from time to time be determined by the Chairman of the Board, or in the
Chairman of the Boards absence by the Chief Executive Officer (should the
Chief Executive Officer be a director), or in the Chief Executive Officers
absence by the President (should the President be a director), or in the
Presidents absence by such officer of the Corporation as designated by the
Board of Directors, or by a majority of the Board of Directors.

  



  

 _Section 3.4_ _First Meeting_

  



  

Each newly elected Board of Directors may hold its first meeting for the
purpose of organization and the transaction of business, if a quorum is
present, immediately after and at the same place as the annual meeting of
the stockholders. Notice of such meeting shall not be required. At the
first meeting of the Board of Directors in each year at which a quorum shall

# ** _ARTICLE VI_** 
 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS

  

# ** **

  

 _Section 6.1_ _Indemnification_

  



  

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by
reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving
as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as
the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the
Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such
indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or
her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as
provided in Article VI, Section 2 of these Bylaws, the Corporation shall
indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with
a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of

  



  

D-13   

     
   

  



  

Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this
paragraph of Article VI shall be a contract right and shall include the right
to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that
if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director
or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a
director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee
benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf
of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise.

  



  

The Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(whether or not an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of
the fact that the person is or was an employee (other than an officer) or
agent of the Corporation, or, while serving as an employee (other than an
officer) or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, to the extent (i)
permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware as from time to time in
effect, and (ii) authorized in the sole discretion of the Chief Executive
Officer and a Vice President of the Corporation (the Chief Executive Officer
and the Vice President so authorizing such indemnification, the "Authorizing
Officers"). The Corporation may, to the extent permitted by Delaware law and
authorized in the sole discretion of the Authorizing Officers, pay expenses
(including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by any such employee or agent
in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action,
suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit
or proceeding, upon such terms and conditions as the Authorizing Officers
authorizing such expense advancement determine in their sole discretion. The
provisions of this paragraph of Article VI shall not constitute a contract
right for any such employee or agent.

  



  

 _Section 6.2_ _Suit_

  



  

If a claim under Article VI, Section 1 of these Bylaws is not paid in
full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has
been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter
bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim
and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be
paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any
such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition
where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which
make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the
Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden
of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of
the Corporation (including the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel,
or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement
of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of

  



  

D-14   

     
   

  



  

Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant
has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.

  



  

 _Section 6.3_ _Nonexclusivity of Rights_

  



  

The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may
have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the certificate
of incorporation of the Corporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

  



  

 _Section 6.4_ _Insurance_

  



  

The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and
any director, employee, agent or consultant of the Corporation or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability
or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

  



  

 _Section 6.5_ _Savings Clause_

  



  

If this Article VI or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each director and officer of the
Corporation, as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VI
that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.

  



  

 _Section 6.6_ _Definitions_

  



  

For purposes of this Article VI, reference to the "Corporation" shall
include, in addition to the Corporation, any constituent corporation
(including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or
merger prior to (or, in the case of an entity specifically designated in a
resolution of the Board of Directors, after) the adoption hereof and which,
if its separate existence had continued, would have had the power and
authority to indemnify its directors, officers and employees or agents, so
that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such
constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall
stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VI with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with
respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued.

# ** _ARTICLE VII_** 
 CAPITAL STOCK

  

# ** **

  

 _Section 7.1_ _Certificates of Stock_

  



  

The Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or
all of any or all classes or series of its capital stock shall be
uncertificated shares. The certificates for shares of the capital stock of
the Corporation shall be in such form, not inconsistent with that required by
law and the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, as shall be
approved by the Board of Directors. Every holder of capital stock represented
by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the
name of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive
Officer, President, a Vice President or such other officer as designated by
the Board of Directors and the Secretary or an assistant Secretary or the
Treasurer or an assistant Treasurer of the Corporation representing the
number of shares (and, if the capital stock of the Corporation shall be
divided into classes or series, certifying the class and series of such
shares) owned by such stockholder which are registered in certified form;
provided, however, that any of or all the signatures on the certificate may
be facsimile. The stock record books and the blank stock certificate books
shall be kept by the Secretary or at the office of such transfer agent or
transfer agents as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. In
case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who shall have signed or whose
facsimile signature or signatures shall have been placed upon any such
certificate or certificates shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer
agent or registrar before such certificate is issued by the Corporation, such
certificate may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at
the date of issue. The stock certificates shall be consecutively numbered and
shall be entered in the books of the Corporation as they are issued and shall
exhibit the holders name and number of shares.

  



  

 _Section 7.2_ _Transfer of Shares_

  



  

In respect of certificated shares of capital stock, such shares of capital
stock of the Corporation shall be transferable only on the books of the
Corporation by the holders thereof in person or by their duly authorized
attorneys or legal representatives upon surrender and cancellation of
certificates for a like number of shares. Upon surrender to the Corporation
or a transfer agent of the Corporation of such certificate for shares duly
endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or
authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new
certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and
record the transaction upon its books. In respect of uncertificated shares of
capital stock, such shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be
transferable only on the books of the Corporation by the holders thereof in
person or by their duly authorized attorneys or legal representatives upon
the compliance with such rules and procedures as may be proscribed by the
Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer,
the President or such other officer as designated by the Board of Directors.

  



  

 _Section 7.3_ _Ownership of Shares_

  



  

The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share
or shares of capital stock of the Corporation as the holder in fact thereof
and, accordingly, shall not be bound

  



  

D-16   

     
   

  



  

to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or
shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have
express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of
the state of incorporation of the Corporation.

  



  

 _Section 7.4_ _Regulations Regarding Certificates_

  



  

The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to make all such
rules and regulations as they may deem expedient concerning the issue,
transfer and registration or the replacement of certificates for shares of
capital stock of the Corporation.

  



  

 _Section 7.5_ _Lost or Destroyed Certificates_

  



  

The Board of Directors may determine the conditions upon which the
Corporation may issue a new certificate for shares of capital stock in place
of a certificate theretofore issued by it which is alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed and may require the owner of such certificate or such
owners legal representative to give bond, with surety sufficient to
indemnify the Corporation and each transfer agent and registrar against any
and all losses or claims which may arise by reason of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new
certificate in the place of the one so lost, stolen or destroyed.

The fiscal year of the Corporation shall begin on the first day of January
of each year.

  



  

 _Section 8.2_ _Corporate Seal_

  



  

The corporate seal shall be circular in form and shall have inscribed thereon
the name of the Corporation and the state of its incorporation, which seal
shall be in the charge of the Secretary and shall be affixed to certificates
of stock, debentures, bonds, and other documents, in accordance with the
direction of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, and as may be
required by law; however, the Secretary may, if the Secretary deems it
expedient, have a facsimile of the corporate seal inscribed on any such
certificates of stock, debentures, bonds, contract or other documents.

  



  

 _Section 8.3_ _Notice and Waiver of Notice_

  



  

Whenever any notice is required to be given by law, the certificate of
incorporation of the Corporation or under the provisions of these Bylaws,
said notice shall be deemed to be sufficient if given (i) by telegraphic,
cable or wireless transmission (including by telecopy or facsimile
transmission) or (ii) by deposit of the same in a post office box or by
delivery to an overnight courier service company in a sealed prepaid wrapper
addressed to the person entitled thereto at such persons post office
address, as it appears on the records of the Corporation, and such notice
shall be deemed to have been given on the day of such transmission or mailing
or delivery to courier, as the case may be.

  



  

D-17   

     
   

  



  

Whenever notice is required to be given by law, the certificate of
incorporation of the Corporation or under any of the provisions of these
Bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice,
whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent
to notice. Attendance of a person, including without limitation a director,
at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when
the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the
certificate of incorporation of the Corporation or these Bylaws.

  



  

 _Section 8.4_ _Facsimile Signatures_

  



  

In addition to the provisions for the use of facsimile signatures
elsewhere specifically authorized in these Bylaws, facsimile signatures of

be protected to the fullest extent permitted by law in relying upon the
records of the Corporation and upon information, opinions, reports or
statements presented to the Corporation.

  



  

 _Section 8.6_ _Application of Bylaws_

  



  

In the event that any provisions of these Bylaws is or may be in conflict
with any law of the United States, of the state of incorporation of the
Corporation or of any other governmental body or power having jurisdiction
over the Corporation, or over the subject matter to which such provision of
these Bylaws applies, or may apply, such provision of these Bylaws shall be
inoperative to the extent only that the operation thereof unavoidably
conflicts with such law or provision, and shall in all other respects be in
full force and effect.
