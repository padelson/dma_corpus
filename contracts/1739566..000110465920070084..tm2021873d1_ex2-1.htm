(g) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement could,
either alone or in conjunction with any other event, result in the payment of
any amount that could, individually or in combination with any other payment,
constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Code). Except as set forth on _Section 3.15(g)_ of the Company and Sellers'
Disclosure Letter, no Utz Company has agreed to pay, gross up, reimburse or
otherwise indemnify any Person for any Tax imposed under Section 4999 of the

Section 3.16 _Insurance_. The Utz Companies have in effect policies
of insurance in amounts and scope of coverage as set forth on _Section

Policies_ "). Each such Insurance Policy is valid, binding and enforceable on
the applicable Utz Company in accordance with its terms, except as such may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles. All premiums
due under such Insurance Policies have been paid in accordance with the terms
of such Insurance Policy. All Insurance Policies maintained for the benefit
of the Utz Companies are maintained by the Utz Companies. The amount and scope
of coverage of the Insurance Policies are customary, adequate and suitable
for companies of a similar nature and size operating in the industries that
the Utz Companies operate in and such Insurance Policies are sufficient for
the current needs of the business of the Utz Companies. No Utz Company is in
material breach or material default under, nor has it taken any action or
failed to take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a material breach or material default under, or permit a
material increase in premium, cancellation, material reduction in coverage,
material denial or non-renewal with respect to any Insurance Policy. During
the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Date, no Utz Company has
received any written notice of material increase in premium (other than
customary annual increases), cancellation, material reduction in coverage,
material denial or nonrenewal of any Insurance Policy. Except as set forth on
_Section 3.16_ of the Company and Sellers' Disclosure Letter, during the
twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Date, there have been no material
claims by or with respect to the Utz Companies under any Insurance Policy as
to which coverage has been denied or disputed in any material respect by the
underwriters of such Insurance Policy. Since the date of the Latest Balance

material Insurance Policy or (b) suffered any damage, destruction, theft or
casualty loss to its tangible assets in excess of three hundred thousand
dollars ($300,000) that is not covered by insurance. Except as set forth on

any Governmental Entity or any other Person alleging a material violation of
any such Laws.

  



  

(b) Each Utz Company holds all material permits, licenses,

with all material terms and conditions of such Permits. All of such Permits
are valid and in full force and effect and none of such Permits will be
terminated as a result of, or in connection with, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Utz Company is in material
default under any such Permit and no condition exists that, with the giving
of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default under
such Permit, and no Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, to suspend, revoke, withdraw, modify or limit any such
Permit in a manner that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the applicable Utz Company to use
such Permit or conduct its business.

attached hereto as _Exhibit L_. Each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in the
Binder Agreement to ensure that the RandW Insurance Policy is in full force and
effect at the Closing. The Buyer shall instruct the insurer under the RandW
Insurance Policy that any proceeds owing or payable by the insurer under the
RandW Insurance Policy shall be paid, or to the extent such proceeds are
received by the Buyer, the Buyer shall pay, (i) to an Utz Company to
the extent constituting a Whole Company Loss and (ii) to the Buyer to the
extent constituting a Buyer Loss. If the Sellers collectively own more than
52% of the Common Units immediately following the Closing, (A) the RandW
Insurance Policy will convert to a pro rata policy, (B) the Buyer shall cause
the limit of liability in the RandW Insurance Policy to be reduced by a
percentage equal to the percentage of Common Units collectively owned by
Sellers immediately following the Closing, with the premium and retention in
the RandW Insurance Policy to be adjusted accordingly, (C) the indemnification
provisions in _Article X_ will continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and (D) any proceeds owing or payable by the
insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy shall be paid (i) to the Buyer, to the
extent constituting a Buyer Loss, (ii) to the Buyer, to the extent
constituting a Whole Company Loss for which the Sellers do not have an
obligation to indemnify under _Section 10.2(a)(ii)_ or  _Section
10.2(a)(iii)_, (iii) to an Utz Company, to the extent constituting a Whole
Company Loss for which the Sellers have an obligation to indemnify under
_Section 10.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_ and for which the Sellers
have paid the amount of such Loss required to be paid under _Section
10.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_ to an Utz Company (or will
simultaneously pay to the Utz Companies with such insurance proceeds) the full
amount of such Loss _less_  the portion paid or payable by the insurer (such
difference, the " _Net Loss_ ") or (iv) to the extent constituting a Whole
Company Loss for which the Sellers have an obligation to indemnify under
_Section 10.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_ and for which the Sellers
dispute the payment of the full amount of such Net Loss (x) to the Buyer, that
amount of the insurance proceeds multiplied by the proportion of the Net Loss
that the Sellers have not paid (or will not simultaneously pay to the
Utz Companies with such insurance proceeds), and further multiplied by the
Buyer's percentage ownership interest in the Company as of the date of
payment of such insurance proceeds and (y) to any Utz Company, the balance of
such insurance proceeds; provided, that, in the case of this _clause (iv)_ ,
to the extent the Sellers pay, at any time or from time to time thereafter,
additional amounts of the Net Loss, then the Buyer shall pay to an Utz
Company, within three (3) Business Days of the Sellers' payment, the
additional insurance proceeds in respect of such Loss to which the Utz
Companies would have been entitled had such additional amount of Net Loss
been initially paid by Sellers in calculating the amount owed to the Buyer
pursuant to _clause (iv)_ , or if the Sellers pay the entire Net Loss, then
Buyer shall pay to an Utz Company the balance of the insurance
proceeds received from the insurer. Buyer agrees that it cannot use any
proceeds received from the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy to purchase
Equity Securities of the Company.

  



  

(b) The cost of obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy, including all
premiums and any related brokers fees, shall be a Transaction Expense.

Article IX _ 
 TAX MATTERS_

  



  

Section 9.1 _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(i) Sellers shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, at the cost and expense of the Utz Companies, all Tax Returns of
each Utz Company that are due on or prior to the Closing Date (taking into
account applicable extensions) and all Tax Returns of each Utz Company for
any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Sellers Prepared Returns_ "). Each Sellers Prepared Return filed after the
Closing Date shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Utz
Companies' past practices except as otherwise required by applicable Law.
Each Sellers Prepared Return that is an Income Tax Return or other material
Tax Return filed after the Closing Date (taking into account applicable
extensions) shall be submitted to the Buyer no later than thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions) for review. Sellers shall consider in good faith all
reasonable comments received from the Buyer no later than ten (10) days
prior to the due date for filing any such Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions). Subject to Section 9.1(k), no filed Sellers Prepared
Return may be amended after the Closing without the prior written consent of
the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. The Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
at the cost and expense of the Utz Companies, all Tax Returns of each Utz
Company (other than Sellers Prepared Returns) for any Straddle Period that
are due after the Closing Date (taking into account applicable extensions)
(the " _Buyer Prepared Returns_ "). Each Buyer Prepared Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the Utz Companies' past practices except
as otherwise required by applicable Law. Each Buyer Prepared Return that is
an Income Tax Return or other material Tax Return shall be submitted to
Sellers no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Return (taking into account applicable extensions) for review and
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Tax Return described in this
_Section 9.1(a)_ for a taxable period that includes the Closing Date (x)
for which the "interim closing method" under Section 706 of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law) is available shall be
prepared in accordance with such method, (y) for which an election under
Section 754 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S.
Law) may be made shall make such election and (z) shall be prepared in a
manner such that any and all deductions, losses, or credits of any of the Utz
Companies resulting from, attributable to or accelerated by the payment of
the Target Repaid Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (which have not been paid on or
before the Closing Date, or accrued or taken into account for or with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period) are allocated to the portion of the taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date to the extent permitted by applicable
Law. For the avoidance of doubt, all Tax Returns of each Utz Company (other
than Sellers Prepared Returns and Buyer Prepared Returns) shall be prepared
and filed in accordance with the terms of the Company AandR LLCA.

  



  

   

 | 81| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) Buyer shall cause the Utz Companies to pay or reimburse the
Sellers for the costs and expenses for the preparation of all Tax
Returns required to be filed by Sellers and SRS Leasing, LLC for taxable
periods that end in 2019 (such Tax Returns, the " _2019 Seller Returns_ ") to
the extent such costs and expenses have not already been paid or reimbursed by
the Utz Companies as of the Closing. Sellers shall be responsible for the
costs and expenses for the preparation of all Tax Returns required to
be filed by Sellers for taxable periods ending after December 31, 2019. Each
2019 Seller Return that is an Income Tax Return shall be submitted to the
Buyer no later than twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return (taking into account applicable extensions) for review. Sellers shall
consider in good faith all reasonable comments received from the Buyer no
later than ten (10) days after such Tax Returns are submitted to Buyer.

  



  

(iii) After the Closing, without the prior written consent of the
Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), Buyer shall not (and shall neither cause nor permit any Utz
Company) to take any of the following actions if such action would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse and disproportionate Tax effect on
Sellers or any of their direct or indirect current or former owners under
this Agreement or otherwise as compared to the Buyer: (w) file (except for
Sellers Prepared Returns and Buyer Prepared Returns as permitted under
Section 9.1(a)(i)), amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax
Return relating in whole or part to any Utz Company with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, (x) enter into an agreement to extend
the statute of limitations with respect to Tax Returns relating in whole or
part to any Utz Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period, (y) make any Tax election or take any position on any Tax
Return with respect to any Utz Company that would have retroactive effect to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, or (z) initiate discussion,
voluntary disclosure or examination with any Taxing Authority regarding Taxes
or Tax Returns with respect to any Utz Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or Straddle Period (except that the Buyer and the Utz Companies shall be
permitted to continue to comply with any voluntary disclosure program that
was initiated prior to the Closing Date).

  



  

(iv) Notwithstanding the deadlines set forth in Sections 9.1(a)(i)
and (ii) with respect to any Tax Return described therein, the Sellers and
Buyer shall reasonably cooperate to set later deadlines if it is reasonably
necessary in order to allow sufficient time for preparation and review of
such Tax Return prior to the due date of such Tax Return (including applicable
extensions) and, in the case of a 2019 Seller Return, to set a shorter time
period for Buyer to review such Tax Return.

  



  

   

 | 82| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) For purposes of determining whether the following Taxes are
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period:

  



  

(i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed
for a Straddle Period, the amounts that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the portion of the taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period;

  



  

(ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on any Utz Company as a result
of income of any Flow-Thru Entity realized on or prior to the Closing Date
(such income being computed assuming the Flow-Thru Entity had a year that ends
as of the end of the day on the Closing Date and closed its books), such
Taxes shall be treated as Taxes of an Utz Company for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period;

  



  

(iii) in the case of all other Taxes for a Straddle Period
(including Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, payments, or
payroll (to the extent not covered by _clauses (i)_ - _(ii)_ above)), the
amount allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on
an interim closing of the books as of the end of the day on the Closing Date
using a "closing of the books" methodology (including deductions under
Section 168(k) of the Code); _provided_ that for purposes of this _clause
(iii)_ , any item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including
amortization and depreciation deductions and the effects of graduated rates
but not including deductions under Section 168(k) of the Code) shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
based on the mechanics set forth in _clause (i)_ for periodic Taxes; and

  



  

(iv) in the case of Taxes in the form of interest, penalties or
additions, all such Taxes shall be treated as attributable to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period to the extent relating to a Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (determined in accordance with _clauses (i)_ - _(iii)_ above) whether
such items are incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or
after the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
_Section 10.2(e)_ shall not apply to Taxes or Tax matters, which are covered
by _Section 9.1_, and, in the event of any conflict between the Company AandR
LLCA and _Section 10.2(e)_, the Company AandR LLCA shall control.

  



  

(d) Each Party shall reasonably cooperate (and cause its Affiliates
to reasonably cooperate), as and to the extent reasonably requested by each
other Party, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Sellers and Tax Returns pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)_, including Buyer signing Sellers Prepared Returns that have been
prepared in accordance with _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ on behalf of an Utz Company,
the preparation of the Allocation, determining the amount of "Tax
Distributions" to be made pursuant to the Company's LLCA (as defined therein)
from and after the Effective Date and prior to the Closing (provided such
cooperation shall not prevent the Company from making the determination of the
amount of such "Tax Distributions" in accordance with and pursuant to the
Company's LLCA and the definition of Tax Distributions hereunder), updating
Section 9.2(a) and Section 9.2(b) of the Company and Sellers' Disclosure
Letter to accurately reflect facts as of the Closing, determining any amount
due and owing under Section 9.2, and any Tax Proceeding with respect to Taxes
or Tax Returns of any Utz Company. Such cooperation shall include the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return, Tax Proceeding or other Tax related matter and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Following the
Closing, the Buyer, the Sellers (to the extent the Sellers have any such books
and records in their possession) and the Company shall (and the Company shall
cause the Utz Companies to) retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Utz Companies relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the seven (7) year anniversary of the
Closing Date, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing Authority. Sellers shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates (other than the Utz Companies after the Closing) to) provide any
information reasonably requested to allow the Buyer or any Utz Company to
comply with any information reporting or withholding requirements contained in
the Code or other applicable Laws or to compute the amount of payroll or
other employment Taxes due with respect to any payment made in connection
with this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 83| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties in writing
upon receipt by the applicable Party or its Affiliates of notice of any Tax
Proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any Utz Company relating to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period;  _provided_ that the failure
to so notify the other Parties shall not relieve an Indemnitor of its
indemnification obligations under _Section 10.2_, except to the extent that
an Indemnitor is materially prejudiced thereby. Such notification
shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Proceeding and
shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received
from the Taxing Authority.

  



  

(i) The Controlling Party shall have the right to control, at the
cost and expense of the Utz Companies, any Tax Proceeding in respect of any
Utz Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; _provided,
however_ , that (A) the Non-Controlling Party shall have the right, at the
cost and expense of the Utz Companies, to participate in any such Tax
Proceeding, (B) the Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling Party
with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such
Tax Proceeding, (C) the Controlling Party shall not settle, compromise or
abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent
of the Non-Controlling Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (D) the Controlling Party shall defend
such Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith and consult with the Non-
Controlling Party in good faith concerning the appropriate strategy for
contesting such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Non-
Controlling Party, at the cost and expense of the Utz Companies, may control
and contest any such Tax Proceeding for which the Controlling Party would
otherwise have the right to control under this _Section 9.1(e)(i)_ if the
Controlling Party declines or fails to diligently conduct such Tax
Proceeding; _provided, further, however_ , that if the Non-Controlling Party
exercises its right to control any such Tax Proceeding under the preceding
clause, the Controlling Party shall have the right, at the cost and expense
of the Utz Companies, to participate in any such Tax Proceeding and the Non-
Controlling Party shall (x) provide the Controlling Party with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (y) not
settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the
prior written consent of the Controlling Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (z) consult with the
Controlling Party in good faith concerning the appropriate strategy for
contesting such Tax Proceeding. With respect to any Tax Proceeding described
in this _Section 9.1(e)(i)_,  " _Controlling Party_ " means (1) the Sellers
if the Sellers and their direct and indirect owners would reasonably be
expected to bear more than fifty percent (50%) of the Tax liability in
connection with such Tax Proceeding (either directly or through claims for
indemnification under _Article X_), (2) the Buyer if the Buyer (directly) or
the Utz Companies would reasonably be expected to bear more than fifty
percent (50%) of the Tax liability in connection with such Tax Proceeding, in
each case, assuming that the full amount of Tax at issue in such Tax
Proceeding were imposed and taking into account claims for indemnification
under _Article X_, or (3) otherwise, the Buyer; and " _Non-Controlling Party_
" means whichever of the Sellers or the Buyer is not the Controlling Party
with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

(ii) Sellers shall have the right to control, at the cost and
expense of the Sellers, any Tax Proceeding in respect of the Sellers for
taxable periods that end in 2019; provided, however, that (A) Sellers shall
provide the Buyer with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage
of such Tax Proceeding and (B) Sellers shall consult with the Buyer in good
faith concerning the appropriate strategy for contesting such Tax Proceeding.

  



  

(f) All Transfer Taxes shall be borne by the Utz Companies. The
Company shall prepare and file or shall cause the applicable Utz Company to
prepare and file _in_ a timely manner, all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes, and, if required by
applicable Law, the Sellers, the Company and the Buyer will, and will cause
their respective Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate and join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The Parties shall
reasonably cooperate to establish any available exemption from (or reduction
in) any Transfer Tax. The Company shall provide the other Parties
with evidence reasonably satisfactory to such other Party or Parties that
such Transfer Taxes have been paid, or if the relevant transactions are
exempt from Transfer Taxes, evidence of the filing of an appropriate
certificate or other evidence of exemption.

  



  

(g) The Parties acknowledge and agree that for U.S. federal and, as
applicable, state and local income Tax purposes, they intend that (i)
the transaction contemplated by _Section 2.2(c)_ (A) be treated as a sale as
of the Closing Date of the Assigned Company Units by Sellers to the Buyer and
a purchase of the Assigned Company Units by the Buyer from Sellers (the "
_Sale_ "), in exchange for the Net Cash Consideration and certain rights
under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and allocated as between the Sellers, as
contemplated by _Section 2.2(c)_ in a transaction described in Section 741 of
the Code (and any similar applicable state or local provisions of Tax Law)
and (B) give rise to an adjustment to the Buyer's tax basis in the direct and
indirect assets of the Company (including stock of the Utz C Corp Entities)
pursuant to Section 743(b) of the Code (and, in each case, any equivalent
adjustments for applicable state and local income Tax purposes), (ii) the
Sale be governed by the first sentence of each of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.197-2(h)(12)(i) and Section 1.197-2(h)(12)(v)(A), (iii) the payment
and contribution of the Excess Cash contemplated by _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_ and
_Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ be treated as a contribution of such Excess Cash by
the Buyer to the Company governed by Section 721 of the Code (and any
similar applicable state or local provisions of Tax Law), (iv) the
Domestication qualify as a " _reorganization_ " within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(F) of the Code, (v) this Agreement be, and hereby adopt this
Agreement as, a " _plan of reorganization_ " within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code, (vi) each step of the Restructuring qualify for the
Restructuring Intended Tax Treatment, (vii) the BSOF Preferred Equity Purchase
and the BSOF Common Equity Purchase (A) be treated as a sale as of the

by BSOF to the Buyer and a purchase of such interests by the Buyer from BSOF
(the " _BSOF Sale_ "), in exchange for the BSOF Consideration and allocated
as set forth in the BSOF Purchase Agreement in a transaction described in
Section 741 of the Code (and any similar applicable state or local provisions
of Tax Law) and (B) give rise to an adjustment to the Buyer's tax basis in
the direct and indirect assets of the Sellers pursuant to Section 743(b) of
the Code (and, in each case, any equivalent adjustments for applicable state
and local income Tax purposes), and (viii) the Redemption be treated as
a distribution pursuant to Sections 731 and 732 of the Code (and any similar

 | 85| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, the
Parties shall adjust the number of Exchanged Company Units, Assigned Company
Units, and Issued Company Units, in each case, (1) that are Common Units (as
defined in the Company AandR LLCA) such that (A) the aggregate number of
Acquired Company Units received by the Buyer at the Closing remains the same
and (B) the value and Capital Account (as defined in the Company AandR LLCA)
associated with each Acquired Company Unit is equal in amount for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes (assuming that such value and Capital Account
associated with each Acquired Restricted Company Unit is zero), taking into
account the amounts disbursed pursuant to Section 2.2 and the U.S. federal
income Tax treatment thereof and (2) that are Restricted Common Units (as
defined in the AandR LLCA) such that (A) the aggregate number of Acquired
Restricted Company Units received by the Buyer at the Closing remains the same
and (B) the fraction of Exchanged Company Units, Assigned Company Units, and
Issued Company Units, respectively, that are Acquired Restricted Company Units
is equal to a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate number of
Acquired Restricted Company Units and the denominator of which is the sum of
the Acquired Restricted Company Units plus the Acquired Company Units. Within
one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date, but in no event
later than January 31, 2021, the Buyer will prepare, and deliver (or cause to
be prepared and delivered) to Sellers, (i) an allocation statement allocating
the Net Cash Consideration and any other amounts treated as consideration for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes with respect to the Sale (the " _Aggregate
Consideration_ ") and the BSOF Consideration and any other amounts treated as
consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes with respect to the BSOF
Sale among the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are
classified as entities that are disregarded as separate from the Company for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes, in each case, taking into account any
adjustment required by Law pursuant to Section 734(b) of the Code as a result
of the Redemption and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (and any
other applicable section of the Code), the Treasury Regulations thereunder
(and any similar provision of state or local Law) (the " _Allocation_ ") and
(ii) a balance sheet, as of the Closing Date, that sets out the Tax basis of
the assets then owned by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are
classified as entities that are disregarded as separate from the Company for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes on the Closing Date and the amount of the
liabilities of the Company and such Company Subsidiaries on the Closing Date
(the " _Tax Basis Balance Sheet_ "). The Allocation shall contain sufficient
detail to permit the Parties to make the computations and adjustments required
under Sections 734(b), 743(b), 751 and 755 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Tax
Basis Balance Sheet and Allocation, the Sellers will propose any changes or
will indicate its concurrence therewith. If the Buyer and Sellers do not
agree with the Tax Basis Balance Sheet or Allocation, then the Buyer and
Sellers shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement on the Tax Basis
Balance Sheet or the Allocation, as applicable, in a manner consistent with
applicable income Tax Law. If the Buyer and Sellers cannot reach agreement on
the Tax Basis Balance Sheet or the Allocation within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of the Sellers' proposed changes, then the Buyer and Sellers shall
submit the dispute to a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the Buyer and Sellers (the " _Tax Accounting Firm_ ") for
resolution, acting as an accounting expert (and not as an arbitrator). For
this purpose, (x) the Tax Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any
disputed item greater than the greatest value for such disputed item claimed
by any party or less than the lowest value for such disputed item claimed
by any party and (y) all fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to
be performed by the Tax Accounting Firm will be allocated between the Buyer,
on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, in the same proportion that
the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Tax Accounting
Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as finally determined
by the Tax Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such disputed items
so submitted. The Tax Basis Balance Sheet and the Allocation, as agreed to by
the Buyer and Sellers or as finally determined by the Tax Accounting Firm, as
the case may be, shall be binding on all Parties (the " _Final Tax Basis
Balance Sheet_ " and the " _Final Allocation,_ " respectively).

  



  

(i) The Parties shall, and shall cause each of their respective
applicable Affiliates to: (1) prepare and file all Tax Returns
consistent with the Final Tax Basis Balance Sheet, Final Allocation and
Intended Tax Treatment (collectively, the " _Tax Positions_ "); (2) take no
position in any communication (whether written or unwritten) with any
Governmental Entity or any other action inconsistent with the Tax Positions;
(3) promptly inform each other of any challenge by any Governmental Entity to
any portion of the Tax Positions; (4) consult with and keep one another
informed with respect to the status of, and any discussion, proposal or
submission with respect to, any such challenge to any portion of the Tax
Positions; and (5) use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
defend the Tax Positions in any Tax Proceeding; _provided_ that, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Parties shall cooperate to make appropriate
adjustments to the Final Allocation (in a manner consistent with the
principles used to create the Final Allocation) to reflect any adjustments to
the Aggregate Consideration as a result of any indemnification payments
pursuant to _Section 10.2_, in which case such adjustments as mutually agreed
by the Parties shall be binding on all Parties and considered part of the
Final Allocation for purposes of this _Section 9.1(i)_.

(j) Without the prior written consent of the Buyer, Sellers and the
Company shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, make
or cause to be made any election under Treasury Regulation Section 301.9100-22
(or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Laws) with respect to
any Utz Company. With respect to any Tax Proceeding of any Utz Company treated
as a partnership for federal income Tax purposes for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or any Straddle Period and for which the election provided for
in Section 6226 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local, or
non-U.S. Laws) is available, the Company shall (and Buyer shall cause the
Company to), and shall cause their respective eligible Subsidiaries to, timely
make all such available elections in accordance with applicable Laws (and
Sellers expressly consent to, and shall reasonably cooperate to the extent
requested by Buyer in, the making of all such available elections). Sellers
and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective
applicable Subsidiaries to, comply with all applicable Laws with respect to
the making and implementation of any such election. Sellers shall consult in
good faith with the Buyer prior to, and reasonably in advance of, effectuating
any transaction whereby (i) each Seller would no longer be properly treated
as a separate partnership (as opposed to Sellers together being treated as a
single partnership) or either Seller would liquidate, in each case, for U.S.
federal or any applicable state or local income Tax purposes and (ii) either
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates could reasonably be expected to
become a related person (within the meaning of Code Section 197(f)(9)(C) and
Treasury Regulations Section 1.197-2(h)(6)) to the Buyer and following which
any Section 197 intangible (within the meaning of Section 197 of the Code) of
any of the Utz Companies could reasonably be expected to become subject to
the anti-churning rules of Section 197(f)(9) of the Code or Treasury
Regulations Section 1.197-2(h). Each of the Company and Sellers shall (and
Buyer shall cause the Company to), and shall cause all of their respective
eligible Subsidiaries, if any, to, make or cause to remain in effect, as
applicable, a valid election under Section 754 of the Code (and any similar
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law) for any taxable period that
includes the Closing Date (and, with respect to the Company and its eligible
Subsidiaries, if any, for any taxable period that includes the date of any
Exchange (as defined in the Company AandR LLCA)).

  



  

(k) The Sellers shall be entitled to receive, without duplication,
any refunds of Seller Taxes actually received by any of the Utz
Companies, and any amounts in respect of Seller Taxes actually applied as a
credit against any Taxes (other than Seller Taxes) of the Utz Companies
otherwise payable in cash by any of the Utz Companies, after the Closing Date,
for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and any Straddle Period attributable to the
period ending as of or before the Closing Date, except to the extent such
refund or credit is (i) attributable to any loss, deduction or similar item
arising in a taxable period (or portion of a Straddle Period) beginning after
the Closing Date (including items governed by the Tax Receivable Agreement)
applied ( _e.g._ , as a carryback) to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii)
reflected as an asset on the books and records of the Utz Companies as of the
end of the day on the Closing Date, or (iii) required to be paid to a third
party pursuant to a contract entered into at or before the Closing. The
Company shall pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers the amount of any such
refund or credit to which Sellers are entitled under this _Section
9.1(k)_, net of any Taxes and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with obtaining such refund or credit, within ten (10) days after such receipt
of such refund or such application of such credit by the Utz Companies. To the
extent that any of the Utz Companies is required to repay to the applicable
Taxing Authority any refund or credit paid to the Sellers pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(k)_ (or any such refund or credit is otherwise disallowed or
reduced by the applicable Taxing Authority), the Sellers shall repay to
the Company (for the account of the applicable Utz Company) such refund or
credit (plus any interest or penalties) imposed thereon by the relevant
Taxing Authority) as promptly as reasonably practicable after a written
request therefor. Upon the written request of the Sellers, Buyer shall cause
the applicable Utz Companies to file a claim for refund or credit to which
Sellers would be entitled under this _Section 9.1(k)_, including through the
filing of amended Tax Returns or otherwise, relating to an Utz Company (or
its assets or operations) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Tax
Period in such form as the Sellers may reasonably request.

Section 9.2 _Post -Closing Adjustment to Tax Distributions for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods_.

  



  

(a) To the extent a Seller's or SRS Leasing LLC's 2019 federal,
state or local Income Tax Returns are not filed prior to the Closing, then
after the Closing, the Company shall make (and the Buyer shall cause the
Company to make) "Tax Distributions" to each Seller as provided in clauses
(ii) and (iii) of the definition thereof in the Company's LLCA in
effect immediately prior to the Closing based on the final IRS Schedule K-1s
(and any similar form prescribed for state or local income Tax purposes) of
such Seller and SRS Leasing, LLC, as applicable, for its taxable year ending
in 2019 (" _2019 Tax Year_ ") as filed after the Closing, taking into account
and reduced (but not below zero) by any "Tax Distributions" (as defined in
and made pursuant to the Sellers' LLCA, the Company's LLCA, and SRS Leasing's
LLCA) previously made by such Seller or SRS Leasing, LLC, as applicable, to
its members and, without duplication, by the Company to such Seller prior to
the Closing, in each case with respect to its 2019 Tax Year (which
distributions made prior to the Closing in respect of the 2019 Tax Year (the
" _2019 Pre-Closing Tax Distributions_ ") are set forth on Section 9.2(a)
of the Company and Sellers' Disclosure Letter as of the Effective Date, and
which shall be updated in accordance with Section 9.1(d)). Such payment, if
any, shall be made to such Seller within ten (10) days after the date such Tax
Returns and final Schedule K-1s (and any similar form prescribed for
applicable state or local income Tax purposes) of such Seller or SRS Leasing,
LLC are filed. For purposes of this _Section 9.2(a)_, any such "Tax
Distributions" made after the Closing with respect to SRS Leasing, LLC shall
be made to Series U.

  



  

(b) After the Closing, the Company shall make (and the Buyer shall
cause the Company to make) estimated "Tax Distributions" to the Sellers as
provided in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition thereof in the Company's
LLCA in effect immediately prior to the Closing for the taxable year of the
Company that includes the Closing Date, but only with respect to taxable
income of the Company allocated to the Sellers for the portion of such
taxable year ending as of the end of the day on the Closing Date, based on an
interim closing of the books of the Company (" _2020 Pre-Closing Taxable
Income_ "), taking into account and reduced (but not below zero) by any "Tax
Distributions" (as defined in and made pursuant to the Company's LLCA)
previously made by the Company with respect to its 2020 taxable year prior to
the Closing (which distributions made prior to the Closing in respect of such
2020 taxable year (the " _2020 Pre-Closing Tax Distributions_ ") are set
forth on Section 9.2(b) of the Company and Sellers' Disclosure Letter as of
the Effective Date, and which shall be updated in accordance with Section
9.1(d)). The Company shall pay (and the Buyer shall cause the Company to pay)
such estimated tax payments, if any, to the Sellers on the quarterly
estimated tax payment dates consistent with past practices. If, based on
the final IRS Schedule K-1 (and any similar form prescribed for state or
local income Tax purposes) with respect to the 2020 taxable year of the
Company, the sum of (i) the 2020 Pre-Closing Tax Distributions, and (ii) the
estimated tax payments for the 2020 tax year made by the Company to the
Sellers after the Closing pursuant to this Agreement is less than the amount
that would have been computed based on such final tax information of 2020
Pre-Closing Taxable Income reflected on such final Tax Returns, calculated in
accordance with such Company's LLCA, then the Company shall pay (and the Buyer
shall cause the Company to pay) such shortfall to the Sellers as soon as
possible after such shortfall is determined by the Parties.

(c) For U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax
purposes, any payments by the Company pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ shall
be treated as a distribution from the Company under Section 731 of the Code
during the taxable year of the Company that includes the Closing Date for the
portion of such taxable year prior to the Closing.

  



  

Article X _ 
 INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

Section 10.1 _Survival Periods_. None of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights
arising out of any breach of such representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements, shall survive the Closing (and there shall be no Liability after
the Closing in respect thereof), in each case, except for (i) those covenants
and agreements that by their terms are to be performed, in each case, in whole
or in part after the Closing, and then only with respect to the period
following the Closing (including any breaches occurring after the Closing),
which shall survive until thirty (30) days following the date of the
expiration, by its terms, of the obligation of the applicable Party under
such covenant or agreement, including when such covenant or agreement has been
fully performed, (ii) _Section 3.24(b)_, which shall survive for fifteen
(15) months after the Closing Date, (iii) _Section 6.1(a)_, which shall
survive for twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, and (iv) _Section
10.2(a)(ii)_, which shall survive until thirty (30) days after the date of
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the
applicable Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
_Section 10.2_, and the indemnity with respect thereto, shall survive the
time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this _Section
10.1 _if written notice of the breach or non-fulfillment thereof giving rise
to such right or alleged right of indemnity shall have been given to the
Party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time, in which
case it shall survive until the associated claim is finally resolved.

  



  

Section 10.2 _General Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 10.2_ and
the other limitations set forth in this Agreement, Sellers shall jointly and
severally indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties and save and hold each of
them harmless from and against and pay on behalf of or reimburse such Buyer
Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses which any such Buyer Indemnified
Party may incur, be subject to or suffer as a result of, arising from or
relating to:

  



  

(i) any breach or non-fulfillment of _Section 6.1(a)_ prior to
the Closing, in each case other than to the extent accounted for on a dollar
for dollar basis in the Closing Statement;

  



  

(ii) any and all Pre-Closing Imputed Underpayments (including if
paid by an Utz Company anytime from and after December 30, 2019, other than
to the extent accounted for on a dollar for dollar basis in the Closing
Statement) and any and all Seller Taxes that are not Pre-Closing Imputed
Underpayments to the extent such Seller Taxes that are not Pre-Closing Imputed
Underpayments exceed $1,000,000; and

  



  

(iii) any inaccuracy or breach of the representation and warranty
set forth in _Section 3.24(b)_ (at the Effective Date or the Closing Date),
in each case other than to the extent accounted for on a dollar for dollar
basis in the Closing Statement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
except in the case of Fraud by Sellers, Sellers' aggregate Liability to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may suffer as a result of, arising from or relating to this Agreement
shall not exceed $490,000,000.

  



  

   

 | 89| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Losses in respect of which an Indemnitee would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification shall be reduced by any amounts or benefits received (whether
in the form of cash, credit or some other beneficial arrangement) in respect
of such Loss, including (i) any insurance proceeds, including pursuant to the
RandW Insurance Policy (net of any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery, including any deductible under
any insurance policy or the retention under the terms of the RandW Insurance
Policy) and (ii) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the reduction
in Taxes of the applicable Indemnitee (which, if the Indemnitee is the Buyer,
shall include reductions realized by the Buyer directly or indirectly through
the Utz Companies, and if the Indemnitee is an Utz Company, shall include
reductions realized by any of the Utz Companies), without duplication, by
reason of a Tax deduction, credit or other Tax benefit realized as a result
of such Losses with respect to the taxable period during which such Loss is
incurred or the immediately succeeding taxable period over (B) the amount of
any additional Tax cost incurred by such Indemnitee (which, if the Indemnitee
is the Buyer, shall include additional Tax cost incurred by the Buyer
directly or indirectly through the Utz Companies, and if the Indemnitee is an
Utz Company, shall include additional Tax cost incurred by any of the Utz
Companies) arising from such Loss or the receipt of such indemnification
payments hereunder and treating the applicable Tax item as the last item to be
used (collectively the " _Third-Party Recovery Proceeds_ ").

  



  

(d) To the extent required by applicable Law, each Indemnitee shall
take commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss in respect of which
such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification upon becoming aware of any
event, state of facts, circumstances or developments which would reasonably
be expected to, or does, give rise thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, with respect to any indemnification obligation of
Sellers pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_, to the
extent coverage is or would reasonably be expected to be available for such
Loss, the Buyer must first seek recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy
before seeking indemnification from the Sellers under, and subject to the
limitations in, this _Article X_, and Sellers shall only be under an
obligation to indemnify all or part of such Loss in accordance with (and
subject to the limitations in) this _Section 10.2_ to the extent such Loss
was not covered or partially covered under the RandW Insurance
Policy (including to the extent not covered or partially covered due to the
retention thereunder). The Buyer shall not be prejudiced in any way for first
seeking recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy so long as the Buyer gives
timely written notice to the Sellers of its right to indemnity by not later
than the end of the survival period for such claim set forth in _Section
10.1_. Further, to avoid losing any rights under _Section 10.1_, the Buyer
shall be permitted to make a simultaneous claim (but shall not seek recovery
from Sellers to the extent coverage is or would reasonably be expected to be
available under the RandW Insurance Policy for such Loss in accordance with the
second preceding sentence) against the Sellers under _Section 10.2(a)(ii)_
or  _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_ for any portion of such Loss not covered under
the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy (including the retention thereunder
applicable to such Loss). With respect to any indemnity claims made pursuant
to _Section 10.2(a)(i)_, the Buyer shall not be required to first seek
recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy before it can proceed against Sellers.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) If any Buyer Indemnified Party desires to make a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 10.2_ (an " _Indemnitee_ "), the
Indemnitee shall promptly notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ")
of the claim in writing after receiving written notice of the claim or the
commencement of any Proceeding by a third party (" _Third Party Claim_
"), describing the nature of the claim, the amount thereof (if known and
quantifiable) and the basis thereof; _provided_ that the failure to so notify
an Indemnitor shall not relieve an Indemnitor of its indemnification
obligations under _Section 10.2_, except to the extent that an Indemnitor is
materially prejudiced thereby. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve any disputed claim for indemnification. Any Indemnitor shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim giving rise
to an Indemnitee's claim for indemnification at such Indemnitor's expense, and
at its option (subject to the limitations set forth below) shall be entitled
to assume the control of the defense thereof by providing notice to the
Indemnitee within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written notice described
in the first sentence of this _Section 10.2(e)_ and in connection therewith,
by irrevocably agreeing to indemnify the Indemnitee for all Losses relating to
such Third Party Claim, subject to the limitations in this _Section 10.2_.
If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, it shall
appoint counsel that is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee (which the
Parties hereby agree that Kirkland and Ellis LLP (" _K andE_") is reasonably
acceptable counsel for the Buyer and Cozen O'Connor is reasonably acceptable
counsel for Sellers) to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense;
_provided_ that (i) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose if the fees and expenses of such separate counsel are borne entirely
by the Indemnitee; (ii) the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume
control of such defense if (A) the claim for indemnification relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal Proceeding, (B) the claim primarily
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief, or (C) the claim presents,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a legal conflict on any
significant issue for one counsel to represent both the Indemnitee and the
Indemnitor; and (iii) if an Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such
Third Party Claim, such Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of
the Indemnitee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before entering into any settlement of a Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , subject to the limitations set forth in this 
_Section 10.2_, an Indemnitor may settle or consent to the entry of judgment
in respect of such claim without the consent of the Indemnitee, if such
settlement or judgment is for (x) money damages only, (y) includes a full and
unconditional release of the Indemnitee from any further Liability in respect
of such claim and (z) does not contain any admission of wrongdoing on the
part of the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee may take any actions reasonably
necessary to defend any Third Party Claim prior to the time it receives
notice from the Indemnitor that it will assume the defense of such claim. If
the Indemnitor makes any payments on any Third Party Claim pursuant to this
_Section 10.2_, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnitee to any insurance
benefits or other claims of the Indemnitee with respect to such
claim, including any claims against third parties.

  



  

(f) Except in the case of Fraud by Sellers, in the event the Closing
occurs, the Buyer Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive source of recovery
for any Losses due to an inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty (other than _Section 3.24(b)_) of Sellers or the Company in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Sellers or the Company pursuant
to this Agreement shall be recovery from the insurance coverage provided by
the RandW Insurance Policy (whether or not available thereunder), including if
the RandW Insurance Policy converts to a pro rata policy, and in no event will
any Buyer Indemnified Party make a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement, including this _Section 10.2_, in respect of any Loss resulting
from any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty (other than
_Section 3.24(b)_) of Sellers or the Company pursuant to this Agreement or
any certificate delivered by Sellers or the Company pursuant to this Agreement
(except to the extent such Loss is expressly subject to indemnification
pursuant to the terms of _Sections 10.2(a)(i)_ or _10.2(a)(ii)_ hereof, but
subject to _Section 10.2(d)_). Subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Section 10.2_, to the extent Sellers are liable to any Buyer Indemnified
Party for any indemnifiable Loss pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_, then
within three (3) Business Days after the final, binding determination of such
indemnifiable Loss, Sellers must pay, or cause to be paid, at the election of
Sellers in their sole discretion, (i) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Buyer Indemnified Party, the amount of such
indemnifiable Loss (after taking into account any recovery under the RandW
Insurance Policy, if applicable), or (ii) by the surrender by the Sellers and
cancelation, for no additional consideration, of a number of Retained Company
Units and the same number of shares of Buyer Class V Voting Stock equal to the
quotient of (A) the amount of such indemnifiable Loss _divided by_ (B) the
Common Stock Price as of the date of such final and binding
determination pursuant to this Agreement, or any combination of the foregoing
_clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ in a total amount equal to the amount of such
indemnifiable Loss payable hereunder.

  



  

   

 | 91| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) To the extent that any Third-Party Recovery Proceeds are
recovered by an Indemnitee after the related indemnification payment has been
made by the Indemnitor pursuant to this _Section 10.2_ for the same Loss, in
order to prevent any recovery of a Loss more than once in respect of the same
Losses suffered, such Indemnitee shall pay over to the Indemnitor, in cash,
the amounts of such Third-Party Recovery Proceeds for which indemnification
payments have previously been made by the Indemnitor, promptly after such
Third-Party Recovery Proceeds are actually recovered, but not more than the
amount of indemnification payment made by Indemnitor pursuant to this
_Section 10.2_. If permitted by applicable Law, in lieu of the foregoing,
such Buyer Indemnified Party may subrogate or assign its rights to recover
under the RandW Insurance Policy to Sellers or their designee.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for
the purposes of this _Section 10.2_, for purposes of (i) determining whether
an inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty has occurred pursuant
to this Agreement and (ii) calculating the amount of Losses arising from an
inaccuracy or breach of any representation and warranty for which an
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, each
representation and warranty in this Agreement (and the corresponding sections
of the Disclosure Letter) shall be read without giving effect to the terms
"material," "in all material respects,"  "Material Adverse Effect" or similar
phrases or qualifiers contained in such representation or warranty (as if
such words or phrases were deleted from such representation and warranty).

  



  

(i) When determining the amount of Losses for which a claim under
_Section 10.2(a)_ has been made, to the extent the Buyer Indemnified Party
seeking recovery or that receives payment for such Loss is not an Utz Company,
the final amount of indemnifiable Losses payable under this Agreement to such
Buyer Indemnified Party shall be reduced to reflect the Buyer's percentage
ownership interest in the Company as of the date of the final and binding
determination of such Loss pursuant to this Agreement; provided that no such
reduction shall be made if such Buyer Indemnified Party suffers such Loss
directly.

  



  

(j) In no event shall any Indemnitee be entitled to duplicate
compensation with respect to the same Losses under more than one provision of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

(k) Except in the case of Fraud, in the event the Closing occurs, the
sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims against any Party
arising under, out of, related to or in connection with this Agreement, shall
be the rights of indemnification set forth in this _Section 10.2_ and, with
respect to any covenant or agreement, specific performance or other equitable
remedies, and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse,
whether in Contract, tort or otherwise against any Party (other than specific
performance, injunction or other equitable relief pursuant to the terms of
_Section 12.10_), it being agreed by the Parties that all of such other
remedies, entitlements and recourse are waived and released by the Parties to
the fullest extent permitted by Law. The provisions of this _Section 10.2_
and the limited remedies provided in _Section 10.2_ were specifically
bargained for by the Parties and were taken into account by them in arriving
at the terms and conditions of this Agreement. No Party shall be entitled to
a rescission of this Agreement or any further indemnification or rights or
claims of any nature whatsoever, all of which are hereby waived by the
Parties to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.

  



  

(l) All indemnification payments under this _Section 10.2_ shall be
deemed adjustments to the Aggregate Consideration for all purposes, including
for income Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

(m) In connection with the Buyer making an indemnification claim
against the Sellers pursuant to this _Article X_ following the Closing, any
determination to be made by the Buyer shall be made by the Audit Committee of
the Buyer Board.

  



  

   

 | 92| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(n) In the event of any indemnification claim by the Buyer against
the Sellers under this _Article X_, the non-prevailing Party (Sellers or
Buyer, as applicable) shall be required to reimburse the prevailing Party
(Buyer or Sellers, as applicable) for its attorneys' fees, costs and expenses
in connection with such indemnification claim, to the extent not otherwise
obligated to be reimbursed.

  



  

Article XI _ 
 TERMINATION_

  



  

Section 11.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing only as follows:

  



  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Sellers and the Buyer;

  



  

(b) by either Sellers or the Buyer by written notice to the other
Party or Parties if any applicable Law is in effect making the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or
any final, non-appealable Order is in effect permanently preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 11.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of this Agreement results in
or causes such final, non-appealable Order or other action (including, with
respect to Sellers, any breach by the Company);

  



  

(c) by either Sellers or the Buyer by written notice to the other
Party or Parties if the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have occurred on or before October 11, 2020 (the "
_Outside Date_ "); _provided_  that if the Buyer Shareholders approve an
extension of the date required to consummate a Business Combination in
accordance with the Buyer Memorandum and Articles, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended to the earlier of (i) such extension date, and (ii)
the six month anniversary of the Effective Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(c)_ shall not
be available to any Party then in material breach of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement
(including, with respect to Sellers, any breach by the Company);

  



  

(d) by Sellers, if Buyer breaches in any material respect any of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or breaches or
fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would render a
condition precedent to Sellers' obligations to consummate the transactions set
forth in _Section 2.5(a)_ or  _Section 2.5(c)_ of this Agreement not
capable of being satisfied, and (ii) after the giving of written notice of
such breach or failure to perform to the Buyer by Sellers, cannot be cured or
has not been cured by the later of the Outside Date and thirty (30) Business
Days after receipt of such written notice (in which case the Outside Date
shall automatically be extended until the end of such thirty (30) Business
Day period, but in no event on more than one occasion) and Sellers or the
Company have not waived in writing such breach or failure; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
11.1(d)_ shall not be available to Sellers if the Company or either Seller is
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement; and

  



  

(e) by the Buyer, if the Company or either Seller breaches in any
material respect any of their representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or the Company or either Seller breaches or fails to perform in any
material respect any of its covenants contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would render a condition precedent to the
Buyer's obligations to consummate the transactions set forth in _Section
2.5(a)_ or _Section 2.5(b)_ of this Agreement not capable of being
satisfied, and (ii) after the giving of written notice of such breach or
failure to perform to Sellers by the Buyer, cannot be cured or has not been
cured by the later of the Outside Date and thirty (30) Business Days after the
delivery of such written notice (in which case the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended until the end of such thirty (30) Business Day
period, but in no event on more than one occasion) and the Buyer has not
waived in writing such breach or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 11.1(e)_ shall not be
available to the Buyer if the Buyer is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

Section 11.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1_, this Agreement shall
immediately become null and void, without any Liability on the part of any
Party or any other Person, and all rights and obligations of each Party shall
cease; _provided_ that (a) the Confidentiality Agreement and the agreements
contained in _Section 7.10(a)_, _Section 7.11_, this _Section 11.2_ and
_Article XII_ of this Agreement survive any termination of this Agreement
and remain in full force and effect and (b) no such termination shall relieve
any Party from any Liability arising out of or incurred as a result of its
Fraud or its willful and material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Article XII _ 
 MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

Section 12.1 _Amendment and Waiver_. No amendment of any provision of
this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by the Buyer, the Company, and Sellers. No waiver of any provision or
condition of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by the Party against which such waiver is to be enforced.
No waiver by any Party of any default, breach of representation or warranty
or breach of covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed
to extend to any other, prior or subsequent default or breach or affect in
any way any rights arising by virtue of any other, prior or subsequent such
occurrence.

Section 12.3 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof (including the first paragraph of (a) _Sections 6.1(a)_ and _6.1(b)_
of the Company and Sellers' Disclosure Letter, and (b) _Section 6.2(a)_ of
the Buyer Disclosure Letter) shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_
that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder may be assigned or delegated by any Party (including by operation
of Law) without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Any purported
assignment or delegation not permitted under this _Section 12.3_ shall be
null and void.

  



  

Section 12.4 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
held to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under
applicable Law in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without invalidating the
remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision,
there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid
and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision as may be possible.

  



  

Section 12.5 _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this
Agreement and the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Disclosure
Letter, Schedule or Exhibit attached hereto or delivered at the same time and
not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set forth in this
Agreement. The use of the word "including" herein shall mean "including
without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," and "hereunder" and words
of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. References
herein to a specific Section, Subsection, Clause, Recital, Section of a
Disclosure Letter, Schedule or Exhibit shall refer, respectively, to
Sections, Subsections, Clauses, Recitals, Sections of a Disclosure Letter,
Schedules or Exhibits of this Agreement. Terms defined in the singular shall
have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice versa. References
herein to any gender shall include each other gender. The word "or" shall not
be exclusive unless the context clearly requires the selection of one (1)
(but not more than one (1)) of a number of items. References to "written" or
"in writing" include in electronic form. References herein to any Person
shall include such Person's heirs, executors, personal
representatives, administrators, successors and permitted assigns; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section 12.5 _is intended to
authorize any assignment or transfer not otherwise permitted by this
Agreement. References herein to a Person in a particular capacity or
capacities shall exclude such Person in any other capacity. Any reference to
"days" shall mean calendar days unless Business Days are specified;
_provided_ that if any action is required to be done or taken on a day that
is not a Business Day, then such action shall be required to be done or taken
not on such day but on the first succeeding Business Day thereafter.
References herein to any Contract (including this Agreement) mean such
Contract as amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time in
accordance with the terms thereof; _provided that_ with respect to any
Contract listed (or required to be listed) on the Disclosure Letters, all
material amendments and modifications thereto (but excluding any purchase
orders, work orders or statements of work) must also be listed on the
appropriate section of the applicable Disclosure Letter. With respect to the
determination of any period of time, the word "from" means "from and
including" and the words "to" and "until" each means "to but excluding."
References herein to any Law shall be deemed also to refer to such Law, as
amended, and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. If any
Party has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement in any respect, the fact that there exists
another representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the
Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" (or similar
phrases) shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not mean simply "if." An accounting term not otherwise
defined in this Agreement has the meaning assigned to it in accordance with
GAAP. Except where otherwise provided, all amounts in this Agreement are
stated and shall be paid in United States dollars. The Parties and
their respective counsel have reviewed and negotiated this Agreement as the
joint agreement and understanding of the Parties, and the language used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to
express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against any Person. Any information or materials shall be deemed
provided, made available or delivered to the Buyer if such information or
materials have been uploaded to the electronic data room maintained by
Sellers and their financial advisors on the Firmex online-platform for
purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Data
Room_ ") or otherwise provided to the Buyer's representatives (including
counsel) via electronic mail, in each case, prior to the Effective Date. The
content of the Data Room as of the Effective Date will be stored on six (6)
identical encrypted USB devices, and Sellers will cause three (3) such
devices to be sent to the Buyer within thirty days of the Effective Date.

Section 12.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement (together with the Disclosure
Letters and Exhibits to this Agreement) contain the entire agreement and
understanding among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings
and discussions (including that certain non-binding letter of intent among
the Buyer, the Sponsor and the Sellers dated February 28, 2020 (the " _LOI_
")), whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter in any way. The
Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights and Liabilities with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exclusively
pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the
Parties disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies
not set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, this Agreement embodies the
justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arm's-length negotiations and no Person has any special relationship with
another Person that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary
buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm's-length transaction.

  



  

Section 12.7 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the other agreements, certificates, instruments
and documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement may be executed and
delivered in one or more counterparts and by fax, email or other electronic
transmission, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement. No Party shall raise the use of a
fax machine or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a
fax machine or email as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a
Contract and each Party forever waives any such defense.

  



  

Section 12.8 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_. The
Law of the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all claims or matters related
to or arising from this Agreement (including any tort or non-contractual
claims) and (b) any questions concerning the construction, interpretation,
validity and enforceability of this Agreement, and the performance of the
obligations imposed by this Agreement, in each case without giving effect to
any choice-of-law or conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Each party
to this Agreement hereby IRREVOCABLY waives all rights to trial by jury in
any Proceeding brought to resolve any dispute between or among any of the
parties (whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of,
connected with, related or incidental to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated BY THIS AGREEMENT and/or the relationships established among the
parties under THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT
AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND
THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING
CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the Parties submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of first, the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or if such
court declines jurisdiction, then to the Federal District Court for the
District of Delaware, in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the Proceeding shall be heard
and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in
this _Section 12.8_, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law or at equity. Each Party
agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding so brought shall be conclusive
and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law or at equity.

Section 12.9 _Trust Account Waiver_. Each of the Company and Sellers
acknowledge that the Buyer has established the Trust Account for the
benefit of its public Buyer Shareholders, which holds proceeds of its initial
public offering. For and in consideration of the Buyer entering into this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, each of the Company and Sellers,
for itself and the Affiliates it has the authority to bind, hereby agrees it
does not now and shall not at any time hereafter have any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to any assets in the Trust Account (or
distributions therefrom to (i) the public Buyer Shareholders upon the
redemption of their shares and (ii) the underwriters of Buyer's initial
public offering in respect of their deferred underwriting commissions held in
the Trust Account, in each case as set forth in the Trust Agreement
(collectively, the " _Trust Distributions_ ")), and hereby waives any claims
it has or may have at any time solely against the Trust Account (including the
Trust Distributions) as a result of, or arising out of, any discussions,
contracts or agreements (including this Agreement) among the Buyer, Sellers
and the Company and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account
(including the Trust Distributions) for any reason whatsoever. The Sellers
agree and acknowledge that such irrevocable waiver is material to this
Agreement and specifically relied upon by the Buyer and the Sponsor to induce
Buyer to enter in this Agreement, and the Sellers further intend and
understand such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against the
Sellers and each of their respective Affiliates that they have the authority
to bind under applicable Law. To the extent any Seller or any of its
respective Affiliates that such Seller has the authority to bind commences any
action or proceeding against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates based upon,
in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the
Buyer or its representatives, which Proceeding seeks, in whole or in part,
monetary relief against the Buyer or its representatives, the Sellers hereby
acknowledge and agree that the Sellers' and such Affiliates' sole remedy
shall be against assets of the Buyer not in the Trust Account and that such
claim shall not permit the Sellers or such Affiliates (or any Person claiming
on any of their behalves) to have any claim against the Trust Account
(including the Trust Distributions) or any amounts contained in the Trust
Account while in the Trust Account.

  



  

Section 12.10 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the
rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached, money damages would be inadequate
(and therefore the non-breaching Party would have no adequate remedy at Law)
and the non-breaching Party would be irreparably damaged. Accordingly, each
Party agrees that each other Party shall be entitled to specific performance,
an injunction or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other
security or needing to prove irreparable harm) to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any Proceeding, in addition to any other
remedy to which such Person may be entitled. Each Party agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
Law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section
12.10 _shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such injunction.

Section 12.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein
expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any Person, other than
the Parties and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder (other than in respect of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the Utz
Indemnified Persons and Non-Party Affiliates, each of whom is an express
third-party beneficiary hereunder to the specific provisions in which such
Person is referenced and entitled to enforce only such obligations
hereunder).

  



  

Section 12.12 _Disclosure Letters and Exhibits_. The Disclosure Letters
and Exhibits attached hereto or referred to in this Agreement are (a)
each hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth
in full herein and (b) qualified in their entirety by reference to specific
provisions of this Agreement. Any fact or item disclosed in any Section of a
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed in each other Section of the
applicable Disclosure Letter to which such fact or item may apply so long as
(x) such other Section is referenced by applicable cross-reference or (y) it
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to such other Section or portion of the Disclosure Letter. The
headings contained in the Disclosure Letters are for convenience of reference
only and shall not be deemed to modify or influence the interpretation of the
information contained in the Disclosure Letters or this Agreement. The
Disclosure Letters are not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed
as, an admission or indication that any such fact or item is required to be
disclosed. The Disclosure Letters shall not be deemed to expand in any way
the scope or effect of any representations, warranties or covenants
described in this Agreement. Any fact or item, including the specification of
any dollar amount, disclosed in the Disclosure Letters shall not by reason
only of such inclusion be deemed to be material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
this Agreement, and matters reflected in the Disclosure Letters are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected
herein and may be included solely for information purposes; and no
Party shall use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any item in the Disclosure Letters in any dispute or controversy
between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
or included in the Disclosure Letters is or is not required to be disclosed
(including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or is within or outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business. No disclosure in the Disclosure Letters relating to any possible
breach or violation of any Contract, Law or Order shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. Moreover, in disclosing the information in the Disclosure
Letters, Sellers do not waive any attorney-client privilege associated with
such information or any protection afforded by the work-product doctrine with
respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed therein. The information
contained in the Disclosure Letters shall be kept strictly confidential by
the Parties and no third party may rely on any information disclosed or set
forth therein.

Section 12.13 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied in this Agreement (except in the case of the
immediately succeeding sentence) or any document, agreement, or instrument
delivered contemporaneously herewith, and notwithstanding the fact that any
Party may be a partnership or limited liability company, each Party hereto, by
its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that no Persons other than the Parties shall have any obligation
hereunder and that it has no rights of recovery hereunder against, and no
recourse hereunder or under any documents, agreements, or instruments
delivered contemporaneously herewith or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith shall be had against, any former, current or future director,
officer, agent, Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator,
controlling Person, fiduciary, representative or employee of any Party (or
any of their successors or permitted assignees), against any former, current,
or future general or limited partner, manager, stockholder or member of any
Party (or any of their successors or permitted assignees) or any Affiliate
thereof or against any former, current or future director, officer, agent,
employee, Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling Person,
fiduciary, representative, general or limited partner, stockholder, manager or
member of any of the foregoing, but in each case not including the Parties
(each, but excluding for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties, a " _Non-Party
Affiliate_ "), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil,
by or through a claim (whether in tort, Contract or otherwise) by or on
behalf of such Party against the Non-Party Affiliates, by the enforcement
of any assessment or by any Proceeding, or by virtue of any statute,
regulation or other applicable Law, or otherwise; it being agreed and
acknowledged that no personal Liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed
on, or otherwise be incurred by any Non-Party Affiliate, as such, for any
obligations of the applicable Party under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, under any documents or instruments delivered
contemporaneously herewith, in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, or for any claim
(whether in tort, Contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, such obligations or their creation. Notwithstanding the forgoing, a
Non-Party Affiliate may have obligations under any documents, agreements, or
instruments delivered contemporaneously herewith or otherwise required by
this Agreement if such Non-Party Affiliate is party to such document,
agreement or instrument. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in, and
subject in all cases to the terms and conditions of and limitations herein,
this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action
of any kind based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought
against the entities that are named as Parties hereto and then only
with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to
such Party. Each Non-Party Affiliate is intended as a third-party beneficiary
of this _Section 12.13_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall Sellers, the Utz Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates or representatives (a) seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, any Equity Financing Source in connection with
this Agreement or (b) seek to enforce the commitments against, make any claims
for breach of any Subscription Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary
damages from, or otherwise sue, any Equity Financing Source for the Equity
Financing in connection with (i) this Agreement or (ii) the obligations of
the Equity Financing Sources for the Equity Financing under the applicable
Subscription Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 12.13 _shall in any way
limit or qualify the rights and obligations of the Equity Financing Sources
for the applicable Equity Financing, the Buyer and the other parties to the
Subscription Agreement to each other thereunder or in connection therewith.

  



  

Section 12.14 _Legal Representation_.

  



  

(a) _Sellers_.

  



  

(i) Each Party hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its directors, managers, officers, owners, employees and Affiliates
(including the Sponsor) and each of their successors and assigns (all such
parties, the " _Waiving Parties_ "), that Cozen O'Connor (or any successor
thereto) (" _Cozen_ ") may represent Sellers or any direct or indirect
director, manager, officer, owner, employee or Affiliate thereof or of any
Utz Company, in connection with any dispute, claim, Proceeding or Liability
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (any such representation, the "
_Seller Post-Closing Representation_ ") notwithstanding its representation (or
any continued representation) of the Sellers and the Utz Companies in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each of
the Buyer and the Company on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties hereby
consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and will not assert) any conflict of
interest or any objection arising therefrom or relating thereto, even though
the interests of the Seller Post-Closing Representation may be directly
adverse to the Waiving Parties.

  



  

   

 | 99| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) Each of the Buyer and the Company acknowledges that the
foregoing provision applies whether or not Cozen provides legal services
to the Utz Companies after the Closing Date. Each of the Buyer and the
Company, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges
and agrees that all communications among Cozen, the Utz Companies, Sellers
and/or any director, manager, officer, owner, employee or representative of
any of the foregoing made in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution, delivery and performance under, or any dispute, claim, Proceeding
or Liability arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any
matter relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged communications and
the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs
solely to Sellers and is exclusively controlled by Sellers and shall not pass
to or be claimed by Buyer, the Sponsor or any of the Utz Companies. From and
after the Closing, none of the Buyer, the Sponsor, any Utz Company or any
Person purporting to act on behalf of or through the Buyer, the Sponsor,
any Utz Company or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same
by any process. From and after the Closing, each of the Buyer and the
Company, on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, irrevocably waives and
will not assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication among Cozen, any Utz Company, Sellers and/or any director,
manager, officer, owner, employee or representative of any of the foregoing
occurring prior to the Closing in connection with any Seller Post-Closing
Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Buyer, the Sponsor or any Utz Company, on the one hand,
and a third party other than Sellers, on the other hand, the Buyer, the
Sponsor and any Utz Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Buyer nor the Sponsor nor any Utz
Company may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Sellers.

  



  

(b) _Buyer_.

  



  

(i) Each Waiving Party hereby agrees that KandE (or any successor
thereto) may represent Buyer or any direct or indirect director,
manager, officer, owner, employee or Affiliate thereof (including the Utz
Companies), in connection with any dispute, claim, Proceeding or Liability
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (any such representation, the "
_Buyer Post-Closing Representation_ ") notwithstanding its representation (or
any continued representation) of the Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Sellers on behalf of
themselves and the Waiving Parties hereby consent thereto and irrevocably
waive (and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising
therefrom or relating thereto, even though the interests of the Buyer Post-
Closing Representation may be directly adverse to the Waiving Parties.

  



  

(ii) Each of the Sellers acknowledges that the foregoing provision
applies whether or not KandE provides legal services to the Utz Companies after
the Closing Date. Each Seller, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications among KandE, the
Buyer, the Sponsor and/or any director, manager, officer, owner, employee or
representative of any of the foregoing made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any
dispute, claim, Proceeding or Liability arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged
communications and the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of
client confidence belongs solely to the Buyer and is exclusively controlled by
the Buyer and shall not pass to or be claimed by Sellers or any of the Utz
Companies. From and after the Closing, neither Seller nor any Person
purporting to act on behalf of or through either Seller or any of the Waiving
Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process. From and after the
Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, irrevocably
waives and will not assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication among KandE, the Buyer, the Sponsor and/or any director, manager,
officer, owner, employee or representative of any of the foregoing occurring
prior to the Closing in connection with any Buyer Post-Closing
Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Sellers, on the one hand, and a third party other than the
Buyer or the Sponsor, on the other hand, the Sellers may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such
third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Buyer.

Section 12.15 _Equitable Adjustments_. If, during the Pre-Closing Period,
the outstanding shares of Buyer Capital Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, with the prior written
consent of the Sellers to the extent required by this Agreement, by reason of
any stock dividend, share capitalization, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation or exchange of shares, or
any similar event shall have occurred (including any of the foregoing
in connection with the Domestication), then any number or amount contained in
this Agreement which is based upon the number of shares of Buyer Capital
Stock will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Sellers and the Buyer
Shareholders the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event.

limited by shares (" _Collier Creek Cayman_ "), to a Delaware corporation
(the " _Domestication_ "), and this Certificate of Incorporation is being
filed simultaneously with the Certificate of Corporate Domestication of
Collier Creek Cayman (the " _Certificate of Domestication_ ").

  



  

Article IV

  



  

Section 4.1. _Capitalization_. The total number of shares of all classes
of stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is [ ● ] shares,
consisting of (i) [ ● ] shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per
share (" _Preferred Stock_ "), (ii) [  ● ] shares of Class A Common Stock,
par value $0.0001 per share (" _Class A Common Stock_"), (iii)
2,000,000 shares of Class B Non-Voting Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per
share (" _Class B Common Stock_"), which shall be divided into 1,000,000
shares of Series B-1 Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (" _Series

the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2)
of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders
of any of the Class A Common Stock, the Class B Common Stock, the Class V

an aggregate 1,000,000 Founder Shares (as defined therein) shall automatically
convert into Series B-1 Common Stock and an aggregate 1,000,000 Founder
Shares shall automatically convert into Series B-2 Common Stock.

Section 4.2. _Preferred Stock_.

  



  

(A) The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ") is
hereby expressly authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by the
DGCL, by resolution or resolutions, at any time and from time to time, to
provide, out of the unissued shares of Preferred Stock, for one or more
series of Preferred Stock and, with respect to each such series, to fix the
number of shares constituting such series and the designation of such series,
the voting powers (if any) of the shares of such series, and the
powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof,
of the shares of such series and to cause to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware a certificate of designations with respect
thereto. The powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and
other special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from
those of any and all other series at any time outstanding.

  



  

(B) Except as otherwise required by law, holders of a series of
Preferred Stock, as such, shall be entitled only to such voting rights,
if any, as shall expressly be granted thereto by this Certificate of
Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to such
series).

  



  

Section 4.3. _Common Stock_.

  



  

(A) Voting Rights.

  



  

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation or
as provided by law, each holder of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall be
entitled to one vote for each share of Class A Common Stock held of record by
such holder on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to
vote; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the fullest extent permitted by
law, holders of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power
with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, any amendment to this
Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations
relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms
of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such
affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders
of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to
this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations
relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

  



  

(2) Except as required by law, no holder of Class B Common Stock, as
such, shall be entitled to any voting rights with respect to Class B Common
Stock.

  



  

   

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(3) Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation or
as provided by law, each holder of record of Class V Common Stock, as such,
shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Class V Common Stock held of
record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders generally or
holders of Class V Common Stock as a separate class are entitled to vote
(whether voting separately as a class or together with one or more classes of
the Corporation's capital stock); _provided_ , _however_ , to the fullest
extent permitted by law, holders of Class V Common Stock, as such, shall have
no voting power pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation with respect
to, and shall not be entitled to vote on, any amendment to this Certificate of
Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any
series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to the terms of one or more
outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series
are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more
other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate of
Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any
series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the DGCL.

  



  

(4) Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of Incorporation or
required by applicable law, the holders of Common Stock having the right to
vote in respect of such Common Stock shall vote together as a single class
(or, if the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock are entitled to
vote together with the holders of Common Stock having the right to vote in
respect of such Common Stock, as a single class with the holders of such
other series of Preferred Stock) on all matters submitted to a vote of the
stockholders having voting rights generally.

  



  

(B) _Dividends and Distributions_.

  



  

(1) _Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock_. Subject to
applicable law and the rights, if any, of the holders of any
outstanding series of Preferred Stock or any class or series of stock having
a preference over or the right to participate with the Class A Common Stock
and Class B Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and other
distributions in cash, stock of any corporation or property of the
Corporation, the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive ratably, taken together as a single class, such
dividends and other distributions as may from time to time be declared by the
Board in its discretion out of the assets of the Corporation that are by law
available therefor at such times and in such amounts as the Board in its
discretion shall determine. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Certificate of Incorporation, the payment of any dividend or other
distribution so declared with respect to the Class B Common Stock shall be
contingent upon, and no dividend or other distribution shall be paid unless
and until, the occurrence of a Conversion Event (as such term is defined in
in that certain letter agreement, dated as of June [●], 2020, by and among the
Corporation, Collier Creek Partners, LLC (the " _CCH Sponsor_ ") and the
other persons party thereto (as the same may be amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms of such letter,
the " _Side Letter_ ")), if any, in respect of any such share of Class B
Common Stock and, upon declaration of any dividend or other distribution, the
record date for such dividend or other distribution with respect to the Class
B Common Stock (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not the Class A Common
Stock) shall be one day before the Conversion Date (as defined in the Side
Letter), and the Board shall so set the record date upon such declaration.
Such dividends or other distributions with respect to the Class B Common
Stock shall be paid to the holders of the Class B Common Stock on the
Conversion Date in accordance with the Side Letter.

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(2) _Class V Common Stock_. Dividends and other distributions shall not
be declared or paid on the Class V Common Stock.

  



  

(C) _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up_. In the event of any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of the Corporation, after payment or provision for payment of the
debts and other liabilities of the Corporation and of the preferential and
other amounts, if any, to which the holders of Preferred Stock or any class or
series of stock having a preference over the Class A Common Stock as to
distributions upon dissolution or liquidation or winding up shall be entitled,
the holders of all outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (including
Class A Common Stock which converted to Class A Common Stock from Class B
Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.3(D) below on or prior to the date
of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up (including if a Conversion
Event occurred as a result of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up))
shall be entitled to receive the remaining assets of the Corporation
available for distribution ratably in proportion to the number of shares
held by each such stockholder. The holders of shares of (i) Class B Common
Stock (other than to the extent such liquidation, dissolution or winding up
constitutes a Conversion Event, in which case such Class B Common Stock shall
automatically convert to Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section
4.3(D) below and the holders of such resulting Class A Common Stock shall be
treated as a holder of Class A Common Stock in accordance with this Section
4.3(C)) and (ii) Class V Common Stock, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) as
such, shall not be entitled to receive any assets of the Corporation in the
event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the affairs of the Corporation.

  



  

(D) _Conversion of Class B Common Stock_. Immediately upon any
Conversion Event applicable to any shares of Class B Common Stock, such
shares of Class B Common Stock shall automatically, without any further action
on the part of the record holder thereof or any other person, convert into
and become an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock, which conversion
shall be effective on the Conversion Date with respect to such shares of
Class B Common Stock, and the holder of such share of Class B Common Stock
shall become a record holder of Class A Common Stock as of such Conversion
Date. Each outstanding stock certificate or book-entry credit, as applicable,
that, immediately prior to such Conversion Event, represented one or more
shares of Class B Common Stock shall, upon such Conversion Event, be
automatically deemed to represent as of the Conversion Date an equal
number of shares of Class A Common Stock, without the need for any surrender,
exchange or registration thereof or any consent or notification. The
Corporation, or any transfer agent of the Corporation, shall, upon the request
on or after the Conversion Date of any holder whose shares of Class B Common
Stock have been converted into shares of Class A Common Stock as a result of
a Conversion Event and upon surrender by such holder to the Corporation of the
outstanding certificate(s) formerly representing such holder's shares of
Class B Common Stock (if any), issue and deliver to such holder certificate(s)
representing the shares of Class A Common Stock into which such holder's
shares of Class B Common Stock were converted as a result of such Conversion
Event (if such shares are certificated) or, if such shares are uncertificated,
register such shares in book-entry form, reflecting that such holder is a
record holder of Class A Common Stock as of the Conversion Date in respect of
the relevant shares of Class B Common Stock.

  



  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(E) _Cancellation of Class V Common Stock_. In the event that any
outstanding share of Class V Common Stock shall cease to be held directly or
indirectly by a holder of a Common Unit (as defined in the Third Amended and
Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of the LLC, dated on or about
the date hereof (the " _LLC Agreement_ "), as set forth in the books and
records of the LLC, such share shall automatically and without further action
on the part of the Corporation or any holder of Class V Common Stock be
transferred to the Corporation and cancelled for no consideration. The
Corporation shall not issue additional shares of Class V Common Stock after
the Closing Date other than in connection with the valid issuance of Common
Units in accordance with the LLC Agreement or the vesting of any Restricted
Common Units (as defined in the LLC Agreement) into Common Units upon
the occurrence of an applicable Vesting Event (as defined in the LLC
Agreement).

  



  

(F) _Reservation of Stock_. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class
A Common Stock an amount equal to the number of then-outstanding Common Units
subject to Exchange (as defined in the LLC Agreement) and then-outstanding
Restricted Common Units plus the number of then-outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock, in each case, from time to time. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of
Class V Common Stock an amount equal to the number of then-outstanding
Restricted Common Units, from time to time.

  



  

(G) _Splits_. If the Corporation at any time combines or subdivides
(by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization,
merger, amendment of this Certificate of Incorporation, scheme, arrangement
or otherwise) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock into a greater or
lesser number of shares, the shares of Class B Common Stock and Class V Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision shall be
proportionately similarly combined or subdivided such that the ratio of shares
of outstanding Class B Common Stock and Class V Common Stock, respectively,
to shares of outstanding Class A Common Stock immediately prior to such
subdivision shall be maintained immediately after such combination or
subdivision; provided, that (i) such actions with respect to the Class V
Common Stock shall be subject to Section 4.1(d) and the last sentence of
Section 3.2 of the LLC Agreement and (ii) such actions with respect to the
Class B Common Stock shall be subject to the last sentence of Section 1.5 of
the Side Letter. Any adjustment described in this Section 4.3(G) shall become
effective at the close of business on the date the combination or subdivision
becomes effective.

  



  

Article V

  



  

Section 5.1. _By-Laws_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
powers conferred by the DGCL, the Board is expressly authorized to make,
amend, alter, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation (as the
same may be amended from time to time, the " _By-Laws_ ") without the assent
or vote of the stockholders in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of
the State of Delaware or this Certificate of Incorporation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Incorporation or any
provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote of the
stockholders, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation required herein (including any
certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock), by
the By-Laws or pursuant to applicable law, the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding
shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order
for the stockholders of the Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind,
in whole or in part, any provision of Article I, Article II or Article IV of
the By-Laws of the Corporation, or to adopt any provision inconsistent
therewith and, with respect to any other provision of the By-Laws of the
Corporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders
of the Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind, in whole or in part,
any such provision of the By-Laws of the Corporation, or to adopt any
provision inconsistent therewith.

Article VI

  



  

Section 6.1. _Board of Directors_.

  



  

(A) Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of
Incorporation or the DGCL, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of the Board. Subject to the investor
rights agreement (the " _Investor Rights Agreement_ ") dated on or about the
date hereof, by and among the Corporation, the Sellers, the CCH Sponsor and
the other parties party thereto, the total number of directors constituting
the whole Board shall be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by
the Board. Subject to the Investor Rights Agreement, the directors (other
than those directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock,
voting separately as a series or together with one or more other such series,
as the case may be) shall be divided into three classes designated Class I,
Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of
one-third of the total number of such directors. Class I directors shall
initially serve for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of
stockholders following the Closing Date, Class II directors shall initially
serve for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders
following the Closing Date and Class III directors shall initially serve for a
term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the
Closing Date. At each annual meeting following the Closing Date,
successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual
meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual
meeting of stockholders. If the number of such directors is changed, any
increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain
the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any
such additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created
directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a
term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no
case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove, or shorten the term
of, any incumbent director. Any such director shall hold office until the
annual meeting at which his or her term expires and until his or her
successor shall be elected and qualified, or his or her earlier death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. The Board
is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to their
respective class in accordance with the Investor Rights Agreement.

  



  

(B) Subject to the rights granted to the holders of any one or more
series of Preferred Stock then outstanding and the rights granted pursuant to
the Investor Rights Agreement, any newly-created directorship on the Board
that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy
occurring in the Board (whether by death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal or other cause) shall be filled by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a
quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by the stockholders). Any
director elected to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold
office until the next election of the class for which such director shall
have been chosen and until his or her successor shall be elected and
qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal.

  



  

   

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(C) Any director may resign at any time upon notice to the
Corporation given in writing or by any electronic transmission permitted
by the By-Laws. Subject to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, any or
all of the directors (other than the directors elected by the holders of any
series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, voting separately as a series or
together with one or more other such series, as the case may be) may be
removed only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Investor Rights Agreement, in case the Board or any one or
more directors should be so removed, new directors may be elected pursuant to
Section 6.1(B).

  



  



  

(D) Whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred
Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as
a series or separately as a class with one or more such other series, to
elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the
election, term of office, removal and other features of such directorships
shall be governed by the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation
(including any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred
Stock) applicable thereto. Notwithstanding Section 6.1(A), the number of
directors that may be elected by the holders of any such series of Preferred
Stock shall be in addition to the number fixed pursuant to Section 6.1(A)
hereof, and the total number of directors constituting the whole Board shall
be automatically adjusted accordingly.

  



  

(E) Directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written
ballot unless the By-Laws shall so provide.

  



  

Article VII

  



  

Section 7.1. _Meetings of Stockholders_. Any action required or
permitted to be taken by the holders of stock of the Corporation must be
effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may
not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders unless such action
is recommended or approved by all directors of the Corporation then in office;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any action required or permitted to be taken by
the holders of Class V Common Stock , voting separately as a class, or,
to the extent expressly permitted by the certificate of designations relating
to one or more series of Preferred Stock, by the holders of such series of
Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with
one or more other such series, may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth
the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of
the relevant class or series having not less than the minimum number of votes
that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which
all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in
Delaware, its principal place of business, or to an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series
of Preferred Stock, special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation
may be called only by or at the direction of the Board, the Chairman of the
Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation or as otherwise
provided in the By-Laws.

Article VIII

  



  

Section 8.1. _Limited Liability of Directors_. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, no director of the Corporation will have any
personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is
amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the
personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the
Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by
the DGCL, as so amended. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this Article
VIII shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation
on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing prior to
such amendment or repeal.

  



  

Article IX

  



  

Section 9.1. _DGCL Section 203 and Business Combinations_.

  



  

(A) The Corporation hereby expressly elects not to be governed by
Section 203 of the DGCL.

  



  

(B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall not engage
in any business combination (as defined below), at any point in time at which
the Corporation's Common Stock is registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of
the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), with any
interested stockholder (as defined below) for a period of three years
following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder,
unless:

  



  

(1) prior to such time, the Board approved either the business
combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an
interested stockholder, or

  



  

(2) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the
stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested
stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock (as defined below) of the
Corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for
purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding
voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) those shares owned by (i)
persons who are directors and also officers and (ii) employee stock plans
in which employee participants do not have the right to determine
confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a
tender or exchange offer, or

  



  

(3) at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved
by the Board and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders,
and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding voting stock of the Corporation which is not owned by the
interested stockholder.

  



  

(C) For purposes of this Article IX, references to:

  



  

(1) " _Affiliate_ " means a person that directly, or indirectly through
one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under
common control with, another person.

  



  

(2) " _associate,_ " when used to indicate a relationship with any
person, means: (i) any corporation, partnership, unincorporated
association or other entity of which such person is a director, officer or

of voting stock; (ii) any trust or other estate in which such person has at
least a 20% beneficial interest or as to which such person serves as trustee
or in a similar fiduciary capacity; and (iii) any relative or spouse of such
person, or any relative of such spouse, who has the same residence as such
person.

Corporation and any interested stockholder of the Corporation, means:

  



  

a. any merger or consolidation of the Corporation or any direct or

_controlled by_ " and " _under common control with,_ " means the possession,
directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting
stock, by contract, or otherwise. A person who is the owner of 20% or more of
the outstanding voting stock of a corporation, partnership, unincorporated
association or other entity shall be presumed to have control of such entity,
in the absence of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a presumption of control shall not apply where
such person holds voting stock, in good faith and not for the purpose of
circumventing Section 9.1(B) of Article IX, as an agent, bank, broker,
nominee, custodian or trustee for one or more owners who do not individually
or as a group have control of such entity.

  



  

(5) " _interested stockholder_ " means any person (other than the
Corporation or any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of

voting stock of the Corporation, or (ii) is an Affiliate or associate of the

"interested stockholder" shall not include (x) any Stockholder Party, any
Stockholder Party Direct Transferee, any Stockholder Party Indirect Transferee
or any of their respective Affiliates or any "group," or any member of any
such group, to which such persons are a party under Rule 13d-5 of the
Exchange Act, _provided_ that a majority of the aggregate shares of voting
stock of the Corporation owned by such group immediately prior to the
business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
becoming an interested stockholder were owned (without giving effect to
beneficial ownership attributed to such person pursuant to Section 13(d)(3) of
the Exchange Act or Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) by one or more
Stockholder Parties, Stockholder Party Direct Transferees, or Stockholder
Party Indirect Transferees, or (y) any person whose ownership of shares in
excess of the 15% limitation set forth herein is the result of any action
taken solely by the Corporation; _provided_ , further, that in the case of
clause (y) such person shall be an interested stockholder if thereafter such
person acquires additional shares of voting stock of the Corporation, except
as a result of further corporate action not caused, directly or indirectly, by
such person. For the purpose of determining whether a person is an interested
stockholder, the voting stock of the Corporation deemed to be outstanding
shall include stock deemed to be owned by the person through application of
the definition of "owner" below but shall not include any other unissued
stock of the Corporation which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement,
arrangement or understanding, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants
or options, or otherwise.

_however_ , that a person shall not be deemed the owner of stock tendered
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by such person or any of such
person's Affiliates or associates until such tendered stock is accepted for
purchase or exchange; or (ii) the right to vote such stock pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a
person shall not be deemed the owner of any stock because of such person's
right to vote such stock if the agreement, arrangement or understanding to
vote such stock arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given in
response to a proxy or consent solicitation made to 10 or more persons; or

  



  

c. has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose
of acquiring, holding, voting (except voting pursuant to a revocable proxy or
consent as described in item (ii) of subsection (b) above), or disposing of
such stock with any other person that beneficially owns, or whose Affiliates
or associates beneficially own, directly or indirectly, such stock.

unincorporated association or other entity.

(12) " _voting stock_ " means stock of any class or series entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors and, with respect to any
entity that is not a corporation, any equity interest entitled to vote
generally in the election of the governing body of such entity. Every
reference to a percentage of voting stock shall refer to such percentages of
the votes of such voting stock.

  



  

Article X

  



  

Section 10.1. _Competition and Corporate Opportunities_.

  



  

(A) In recognition and anticipation that members of the Board who
are not employees of the Corporation (" _Non-Employee Directors_ ") and their
respective Affiliates and Affiliated Entities (each, as defined below) may now
engage and may continue to engage in the same or similar activities or
related lines of business as those in which the Corporation, directly or
indirectly, may engage and/or other business activities that overlap with or
compete with those in which the Corporation, directly or indirectly, may
engage, the provisions of this Article X are set forth to regulate and define
the conduct of certain affairs of the Corporation with respect to certain
classes or categories of business opportunities as they may involve any of the
Non-Employee Directors or their respective Affiliates and the powers, rights,
duties and liabilities of the Corporation and its directors, officers and
stockholders in connection therewith.

  



  

   

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(B) No Non-Employee Director or his or her Affiliates or Affiliated
Entities (the Persons (as defined below) above being referred
to, collectively, as " _Identified Persons_ " and, individually, as an "
_Identified Person_ ") shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have
any duty to refrain from directly or indirectly (1) engaging in the same or
similar business activities or lines of business in which the Corporation or
any of its Affiliates now engages or proposes to engage or (2) otherwise
competing with the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, and, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, no Identified Person shall be liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders or to any Affiliate of the Corporation for
breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that such
Identified Person engages in any such activities. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy
in, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any business
opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for an Identified Person and
the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, except as provided in Section
10.1(C) of this Article X. Subject to Section 10.1(C) of this Article X, in
the event that any Identified Person acquires knowledge of a potential
transaction or other business opportunity which may be a corporate
opportunity for itself, herself or himself and the Corporation or any of its
Affiliates, such Identified Person shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or other business
opportunity to the Corporation or any of its Affiliates and, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, shall not be liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders or to any Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any
fiduciary duty as a stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation
solely by reason of the fact that such Identified Person pursues or acquires
such corporate opportunity for itself, herself or himself, or offers or
directs such corporate opportunity to another Person.

  



  

(C) The Corporation does not renounce its interest in any corporate
opportunity offered to any Non-Employee Director if such opportunity is
expressly offered or presented to, or acquired or developed by, such person
solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation,
and the provisions of Section 10.1(B) of this Article X shall not apply to any
such corporate opportunity.

  



  

(D) In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Article X, a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to be a potential
corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a business opportunity that
(i) the Corporation is neither financially or legally able, nor contractually
permitted to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the line of the
Corporation's business or is of no practical advantage to the Corporation,
(iii) is one in which the Corporation has no interest or
reasonable expectancy, or (iv) is one presented to any account for the
benefit of a member of the Board or such member's Affiliate over which such
member of the Board has no direct or indirect influence or control, including,
but not limited to, a blind trust.

  



  

   

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(E) For purposes of this Article X, (i) "Affiliate" shall mean (a)
in respect of a member of the Board, any Person that, directly or indirectly,
is controlled by such member of the Board (other than the Corporation and any
entity that is controlled by the Corporation) and (b) in respect of the
Corporation, any Person that, directly or indirectly, is controlled by the
Corporation; (ii) "Affiliated Entity" shall mean (x) any Person of which a
Non-Employee Director serves as an officer, director, employee, agent or
other representative (other than the Corporation and any entity that is
controlled by the Corporation), (y) any direct or indirect partner,
stockholder, member, manager or other representative of such Person or (z)
any Affiliate of any of the foregoing; and (iii) "Person" shall mean any
individual, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, trust, association or any other entity.

  



  

(F) To the fullest extent permitted by law, any Person purchasing or
otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of capital stock of the
Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the
provisions of this Article X.

  



  

(G) Any alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this Article
X shall require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the total voting
power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this
Article X, nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any
series of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this Article X, shall eliminate
or reduce the effect of this Article X in respect of any business opportunity
first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit
or claim that, but for this Article X, would accrue or arise, prior to such
alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption. This Article X shall not
limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or
advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this
Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws or applicable law.

  



  

Article XI

  



  

Section 11.1. _Severability_. If any provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied
to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever, the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provision in any other circumstance and of the
remaining provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation (including, without
limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Certificate of
Incorporation containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

Article XII

  



  

Section 12.1. _Forum_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to
the selection of an alternative forum, (i) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a
claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director,
officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation
or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action (a) arising pursuant to
any provision of the DGCL, this Certificate of Incorporation (as it may
be amended or restated) or the By-Laws or (b) as to which the DGCL confers
jurisdiction on the Delaware Court of Chancery or (iv) any action asserting a
claim against the Corporation or any officer or director of the Corporation
governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and
exclusively brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery; _provided_ , _however_
, that, in the event that the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks subject matter
jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum
for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located
within the State of Delaware, in each such case, unless the Court of
Chancery (or such other state or federal court located within the State of
Delaware, as applicable) has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff
asserting the same claims because such court lacked personal jurisdiction over
an indispensable party named as a defendant therein. Unless the Corporation
consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal
district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any
complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the
Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to
enforce the foregoing provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any
person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in
shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of
and consented to the provisions of this Article XII.

  



  

Article XIII

  



  

Section 13.1. _Amendments_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, in addition to any vote required
by law, the following provisions in this Certificate of Incorporation may be
amended, altered, repealed or rescinded, in whole or in part, or any
provision inconsistent therewith or herewith may be adopted, only by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power
of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class: Article V, Article VI, Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX, Article
XII and this Article XIII. Except as expressly provided in the foregoing
sentence and the remainder of this Certificate of Incorporation (including
any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock),
this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended by the affirmative vote of
the holders of at least a majority of the total voting power of all the then
outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

UTZ BRANDS, INC.

  



  

Article I.

  

STOCKHOLDERS

  



  

Section 1. The annual meeting of the stockholders of Utz Brands, Inc.
(the " _Corporation_ ") for the purpose of electing directors and for the
transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before the
meeting shall be held on such date, and at such time and place, if any,
within or without the State of Delaware, or by means of remote communications
pursuant to paragraph (C)(2) of Section 12, as may be designated from time to
time by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ "). The
Corporation may postpone, reschedule or cancel any annual meeting of
stockholders previously scheduled.

  



  

Section 2. Except as otherwise required by the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") or the certificate of incorporation of
the Corporation (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "), and subject to the
rights of the holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock (as defined
in the Certificate of Incorporation), special meetings of the stockholders of
the Corporation may be called only by or at the direction of the Board, the
Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.
Special meetings may be held either at a place, within or without the State of
Delaware, or by means of remote communications pursuant to paragraph (C)(2)
of Section 12 as the Board may determine.

  



  

Section 3. Except as otherwise provided by the DGCL, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-Laws, notice of the date, time, place (if any), the
means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy
holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting
(if such date is different from the record date for stockholders entitled to
notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes of the meeting of stockholders shall be given not more than sixty
(60), nor less than ten (10), days previous thereto (unless a different time
is specified by law), to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting as
of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such
stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
Without limiting the manner by which notices of meetings otherwise may be
given effectively to stockholders, any such notice may be given by electronic
transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 4. The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued
and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the
stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise
provided herein, by applicable law or by the Certificate of Incorporation;
but if at any meeting of stockholders there shall be less than a quorum
present, the chairman of the meeting or, by a majority in voting power
thereof, the stockholders present (either in person or by proxy) may, to the
extent permitted by law, adjourn the meeting from time to time without further
notice other than announcement at the meeting of the date, time and place, if
any, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders may
be deemed present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, until a
quorum shall be present or represented. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where
a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a
majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series or
classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute
a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. At
any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented by
proxy, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the
original meeting. Notice need not be given of any adjourned meeting if the
time, date and place, if any, and the means of remote communication, if any,
by which stockholders may be deemed present in person and vote at such
adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the adjournment is for more than
thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for
the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of
such adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of
the record date for notice of such adjourned meeting.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Section 5. The Chairman of the Board, or in the absence of the Chairman
of the Board or at the Chairman of the Board's direction, the Chief Executive
Officer, or in the Chief Executive Officer's absence or at the Chief Executive
Officer's direction, any officer of the Corporation shall call all meetings
of the stockholders to order and shall act as chairman of any such meetings.
The Secretary of the Corporation or, in such officer's absence, an Assistant
Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting. If neither the Secretary
nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the chairman of the meeting shall
appoint a secretary of the meeting. The Board may adopt such rules and
regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem
appropriate. Unless otherwise determined by the Board prior to the meeting,
the chairman of the meeting shall determine the order of business and
shall have the authority in his or her discretion to regulate the conduct of
any such meeting, including, without limitation, convening the meeting and
adjourning the meeting (whether or not a quorum is present), announcing the
date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter
upon which the stockholders will vote, imposing restrictions on the persons
(other than stockholders of record of the Corporation or their duly appointed
proxies) who may attend any such meeting, establishing procedures for
the transaction of business at the meeting (including the dismissal of
business not properly presented), maintaining order at the meeting and safety
of those present, restricting entry to the meeting after the time fixed for
commencement thereof and limiting the circumstances in which any person may
make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of stockholders. Unless and
to the extent determined by the Board or the chairman over the meeting,
meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with
the rules of parliamentary procedure.

  



  

Section 6. At all meetings of stockholders, any stockholder entitled to
vote thereat shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy, subject to
applicable law. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may
authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy
pursuant to the DGCL, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a
stockholder may grant such authority: (1) a stockholder may execute a writing
authorizing another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy, and
execution of the writing may be accomplished by the stockholder or the
stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such
writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any
reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature; or
(2) a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing by means of electronic
transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a
proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent
duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive
such transmission, provided that any such means of electronic transmission
must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.
If it is determined that such electronic transmissions are valid, the
inspector or inspectors of stockholder votes or, if there are no such
inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the
information upon which they relied.

  



  

A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and
only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support
an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not
irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to
the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy
bearing a later date.

  



  

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing or transmission created pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this
Section 6 (including any electronic transmission) may be substituted or used
in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for
which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such
copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

  



  

Proxies shall be filed with the secretary of the meeting prior to or at the
commencement of the meeting to which they relate.

  



  

Section 7. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the
holders of a majority of the votes cast shall decide any question brought
before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the DGCL a
different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern
and control the decision of such question. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required
and a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast
by shares of such class or series or classes or series shall be the act
of such class or series or classes or series, unless the question is one upon
which by express provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws
or the DGCL a different vote is required, in which case such express provision
shall govern and control the decision of such question.

Section 8. (A) In order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required
by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the
date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date,
that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for
making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; _provided, however_ , that the Board may fix a new record date for
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and
in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to
notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed
for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at
the adjourned meeting.

  



  

(B) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change or conversion or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the
Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date
shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no such record
date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

Section 9. At any time when action by one or more classes or series of
stockholders of the Corporation is permitted to be taken by written
consent pursuant to the terms and limitations set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation, the provisions of this section shall apply. All consents
properly delivered in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the
DGCL shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent
shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless,
within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the
Corporation as required by the DGCL, written consents signed by the
holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so
delivered to the Corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a
meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those
stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been
taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the
record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written
consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were
delivered to the Corporation as provided in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Any action taken pursuant to such written consent or consents of the
stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the
stockholders at a meeting thereof. In order that the Corporation may determine
the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board.
If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by the DGCL,
shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth
the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by
delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of
the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.
Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has
been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by
the DGCL, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.

Section 10. The Corporation shall prepare, at least ten (10) days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled
to vote at the meeting ( _provided, however_ , if the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days
before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders
entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the
number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall
be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the
meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (i) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the
meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of
business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines
to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then
a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and
kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and
may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be
held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be
open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the
meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information
required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.

  



  

Section 11. The Board, in advance of all meetings of the stockholders,
shall appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes, who may be
employees or agents of the Corporation or stockholders or their proxies, but
who shall not be directors of the Corporation or candidates for election as
directors. In the event that the Board fails to so appoint one or more
inspectors of stockholder votes or, in the event that one or more inspectors
of stockholder votes previously designated by the Board fails to appear or act
at the meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may appoint one
or more inspectors of stockholder votes to fill such vacancy or
vacancies. Inspectors of stockholder votes appointed to act at any meeting of
the stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, shall
take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector of
stockholder votes with strict impartiality and according to the best of their
ability and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them. The inspector or
inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of
shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting
power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the
Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and
ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a
reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any
determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of
the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the
meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such
certification and report shall specify such other information as may be
required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and
ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors
may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law.

  



  

Section 12.

  



  

(A) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_.

  



  

(1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board and the
proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at
an annual meeting of stockholders only (a) as provided in the Investor Rights
Agreement (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), (b) pursuant to
the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) delivered
pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of these By-Laws, (c) by or at the direction
of the Board or any authorized committee thereof or (d) by any stockholder of
the Corporation who is entitled to vote on such election or such other
business at the meeting, who has complied with the notice procedures set
forth in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (A) of this Section
12 and who was a stockholder of record at the time such notice was delivered
to the Secretary of the Corporation.

  



  

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought
before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to Article I, Section
12(A)(1)(d) of these By-laws, the stockholder must have given timely notice
thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation (even if such matter
is already the subject of any notice to the stockholders or a public
announcement from the Board), and, in the case of business other than
nominations of persons for election to the Board, such other business must be
a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice
shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty
(120) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual
meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the date of the
annual meeting is scheduled for more than thirty (30) days before, or more
than seventy (70) days following, such anniversary date, or if no annual
meeting was held in the preceding year, notice by the stockholder to be
timely must be so delivered not later than the tenth day following the day on
which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. For
purposes of the application of Rule 14a-4(c) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") (or any successor provision), the
date for notice specified in this paragraph (A)(2) shall be the earlier of
the date calculated as hereinbefore provided or the date specified in
paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 14a-4. For purposes of the first annual meeting of
stockholders following the adoption of these By-Laws, the date of the
preceding year's annual meeting shall be deemed to be [ ● ] of the
preceding calendar year.

Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the
stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a
director all information relating to such person that is required to be
disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is
otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including such person's

and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend these By-
Laws, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting
such business at the meeting and any substantial interest (within the meaning
of Item 5 of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act) in such business of such
stockholder and the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act), if any, on whose behalf the proposal is
made; (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner,
if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and
address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books and
records, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class or series and number of
shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned directly or
indirectly, beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such
beneficial owner, (iii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of
record of the stock of the Corporation at the time of the giving of the
notice, will be entitled to vote at such meeting and will appear in person or
by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, (iv) a
representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, will
be or is part of a group which will (A) deliver a proxy statement and/or form
of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the voting power of the
Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the
proposal or elect the nominee and/or (B) otherwise solicit proxies or votes
from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination, (v) a
certification regarding whether such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any,
have complied with all applicable federal, state and other legal requirements
in connection with the stockholder's and/or beneficial owner's acquisition of
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Corporation and/or the
stockholder's and/or beneficial owner's acts or omissions as a stockholder of
the Corporation and (vi) any other information relating to such stockholder
and beneficial owner, if any, required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or
other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies
for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in an
election contest pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (d) a
description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the
nomination or proposal and/or the voting of shares of any class or series of
stock of the Corporation between or among the stockholder giving the notice,
the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is
made, any of their respective affiliates or associates and/or any others
acting in concert with any of the foregoing (collectively, " _proponent
persons_ "); and (e) a description of any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (including without limitation any contract to purchase or sell,
acquisition or grant of any option, right or warrant to purchase or sell,
swap or other instrument) the intent or effect of which may be (i)
to transfer to or from any proponent person, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of any security of the Corporation, (ii)
to increase or decrease the voting power of any proponent person with respect
to shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation and/or (iii) to
provide any proponent person, directly or indirectly, with the opportunity to
profit or share in any profit derived from, or to otherwise benefit
economically from, any increase or decrease in the value of any security of
the Corporation. A stockholder providing notice of a proposed nomination for
election to the Board or other business proposed to be brought before a
meeting (whether given pursuant to this paragraph (A)(2) or paragraph (B)
of this Section 12) shall update and supplement such notice from time to time
to the extent necessary so that the information provided or required to be
provided in such notice shall be true and correct as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting and as of the
date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, provided that if the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting is less than fifteen (15) days
prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the
information shall be supplemented and updated as of such later date. Any such
update and supplement shall be delivered in writing to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) days
after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of
the meeting (in the case of any update or supplement required to be made as of
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting), not later than ten (10) days prior to the date for the meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof (in the case of any update or
supplement required to be made as of fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof) and not later than five (5) days
after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting, but no later than the date prior to the meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof (in the case of any update and supplement
required to be made as of a date less than fifteen (15) days prior the date of
the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof). The Corporation may
require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may
reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to
serve as a director of the Corporation and to determine the independence of
such director under the Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder and
applicable stock exchange rules.

The foregoing notice requirements of this paragraph (A)(2) of Section 12
shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder as to any proposal (other than
nominations) if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of such
stockholder's intention to present such proposal at an annual meeting in
compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) of the Exchange Act, and
such stockholder has complied with the requirements of such Rule for
inclusion of such proposal in a proxy statement prepared by the
Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. Nothing in this
paragraph (A)(2), Section 12 shall be deemed to affect any rights of
stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy
statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph
(A)(2) of this Section 12 to the contrary, in the event that the number of
directors to be elected to the Board is increased, effective after the time
period for which nominations would otherwise be due under paragraph (A)(2) of
this Section 12, and there is no public announcement naming all of the
nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board made by
the Corporation at least one hundred (100) days prior to the
first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's
notice required by this Section 12 shall also be considered timely, but only
with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it
shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day
following the day on which a public announcement of such increase is first
made by the Corporation.

  



  

(B) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business shall
be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting
pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of these By-Laws. Nominations of persons for
election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at
which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of
meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board or a committee thereof or (b)
provided that the Board has determined that directors shall be elected at such
meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is entitled to vote on
such election at the meeting, who has complied with the notice procedures set
forth in this Section 12 and who is a stockholder of record at the time such
notice is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation. In the event the
Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of
electing one or more directors to the Board, any such stockholder entitled to
vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the
case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the
Corporation's notice of meeting if the stockholder's notice as required by
paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 12 is delivered to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the
close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting
or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made
of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board
to be elected at such meeting.

  



  

(C) _General_. (1) Only persons who are nominated in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 12 shall be eligible to be
elected to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a
meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 12\. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws,
the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether
a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was
made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 12 and, if
any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 12,
to declare that such defective nomination shall be disregarded or that such
proposed business shall not be transacted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear
at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to
present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and
such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies
in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For
purposes of this Section 12, to be considered a qualified representative of
the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or
partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by
such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder
to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such
person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable
reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of
stockholders.

  



  

(2) If authorized by the Board in its sole discretion, and subject
to such rules, regulations and procedures as the Board may adopt,
stockholders of the Corporation and proxyholders not physically present at a
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may, by means of
remote communication participate in a meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation and be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation whether such meeting is to be held at a
designated place or solely by means of remote communication;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to
verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting
by means of remote communication is a stockholder of the Corporation or
proxyholder; (ii) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to
provide such stockholders of the Corporation and proxyholders a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to
the stockholders of the Corporation, including an opportunity to read or hear
the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such
proceedings; and (iii)  if any stockholder of the Corporation or proxyholder
votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote
communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by
the Corporation.

  



  

(3) For purposes of this Section 12, " _public announcement_ "
shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News
Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service, in a document
publicly filed or furnished by the Corporation with the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
or otherwise disseminated in a manner constituting " _public disclosure_ "
under Regulation FD promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

  



  

(4) No adjournment or postponement or notice of adjournment or
postponement of any meeting shall be deemed to constitute a new notice (or
extend any notice time period) of such meeting for purposes of this Section
12, and in order for any notification required to be delivered by a
stockholder pursuant to this Section 12 to be timely, such notification must
be delivered within the periods set forth above with respect to the
originally scheduled meeting.

  



  

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section 12; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any references in these By-Laws to the
Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not
intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or
proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this Section
12 (including paragraphs (A)(1)(d) and (B) hereof), and compliance with
paragraphs (A)(1)(d) and (B) of this Section 12 shall be the exclusive means
for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business. Nothing in
this Section 12 shall apply to the right, if any, of the holders of any
series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for as long as the
Investor Rights Agreement (as defined in the Certificate of
Incorporation) remains in effect with respect to the Stockholder Parties (as
defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), the Stockholder Parties (to the
extent then subject to the Investor Rights Agreement) shall not be subject to
the notice procedures set forth in paragraphs (A)(2), (A)(3) or (B) of this
Section 12 with respect to any annual or special meeting of stockholders to
the extent necessary to effect the transactions and rights set forth in the
Investor Rights Agreement.

Article II. 
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

Section 1. The Board shall consist, subject to the Certificate of
Incorporation and the Investor Rights Agreement, of such number of
directors as shall from time to time be fixed exclusively by resolution
adopted by the Board. Directors shall (except as hereinafter provided for the
filling of vacancies and newly created directorships and except as otherwise
expressly provided in the Certificate of Incorporation) be elected by the
holders of a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
election of such directors in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of
Incorporation and the Investor Rights Agreement, as applicable. A majority of
the total number of directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business. Except as otherwise provided by law, these By-
Laws, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by the Investor Rights
Agreement, the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at
which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board. Directors need not be
stockholders.

  



  

Section 2. Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Investor
Rights Agreement, unless otherwise required by the DGCL or Article
II, Section 4 of these By-Laws, any newly created directorship on the Board
that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy
occurring in the Board (whether by death, resignation, removal, retirement,
disqualification or otherwise) shall be filled only by a majority of the
directors then in office, although less than a quorum, by any authorized
committee of the Board or by a sole remaining director.

  



  

Section 3. Meetings of the Board shall be held at such place, if any,
within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be fixed
by resolution of the Board or as may be specified in the notice of any
meeting. Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at such times as may
from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board and special meetings may
be held at any time upon the call of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer, or by a majority of the total number of directors then in
office, by written notice, including facsimile, e-mail or other means of
electronic transmission, duly served on or sent and delivered to each
director in accordance with Article X, Section 2\. Notice of each special
meeting of the Board shall be given, as provided in Article X, Section 2, to
each director (i) at least twenty-four (24) hours before the meeting if such
notice is oral notice given personally or by telephone or written notice
given by hand delivery or by means of a form of electronic transmission and
delivery; (ii) at least two (2) days before the meeting if such notice is
sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service; and (iii) at
least five (5) days before the meeting if such notice is sent through the
United States mail. If the Secretary shall fail or refuse to give such
notice, then the notice may be given by the officer who called the meeting or
the directors who requested the meeting. The notice of any meeting need not
specify the purposes thereof. A meeting of the Board may be held
without notice immediately after the annual meeting of stockholders at the
same place, if any, at which such meeting is held. Notice need not be given
of regular meetings of the Board held at times fixed by resolution of the
Board. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director who shall
attend such meeting (except when the director attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened), or who shall waive notice thereof, before or after such meeting,
in writing (including by electronic transmission).

  



  

Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one
or more series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the
right, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or
more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, and other features of
such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the Certificate of
Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series
of Preferred Stock) applicable thereto. The number of directors that may be
elected by the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock shall be
in addition to the total number of directors fixed by the Board pursuant to
the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in the terms of such series, the number of directors that
may be so elected by the holders of any such series of stock shall be elected
for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and vacancies
among directors so elected by the separate vote of the holders of any such
series of Preferred Stock shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the remaining directors elected by such series, or, if there are
no such remaining directors, by the holders of such series in the same manner
in which such series initially elected a director.

Section 5. The Board may from time to time establish one or more
committees of the Board to serve at the pleasure of the Board, which shall
be comprised of such members of the Board, subject to the Investor Rights
Agreement, and have such duties as the Board shall from time to time
determine. Any director may belong to any number of committees of the Board.
Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Investor Rights
Agreement, the Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members
of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any
meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of
a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not
disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a
quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the
meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member, subject to
the Investor Rights Agreement. Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and
the Investor Rights Agreement, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate
of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the resolution of the Board
designating the committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees,
each subcommittee to consist of one or more members of the committee, and may
delegate to a subcommittee any or all of the powers and authority of the
committee.

  



  

Section 6. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof may be taken without
a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be,
consent thereto in writing (including by electronic transmission), and the
writing or writings (including any electronic transmission or transmissions)
are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board.

  



  

Section 7. The members of the Board or any committee thereof may
participate in a meeting of such Board or committee, as the case may be, by
means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of
which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and
participation in a meeting pursuant to this subsection shall constitute
presence in person at such a meeting.

  



  

Section 8. The Board may establish policies for the compensation of
directors and for the reimbursement of the expenses of directors, in
each case, in connection with services provided by directors to the
Corporation.

  



  

Article III. 
 OFFICERS

  



  

Section 1. The Board shall elect officers of the Corporation, including a
Chief Executive Officer, a President and a Secretary. The Board may also from
time to time elect such other officers as it may deem proper or may delegate
to any elected officer of the Corporation the power to appoint and remove any
such other officers and to prescribe their respective terms of office,
authorities and duties. Any Vice President may be designated Executive,
Senior or Corporate, or may be given such other designation or combination of
designations as the Board or the Chief Executive Officer may determine. Any
two or more offices may be held by the same person. The Board may also elect
or appoint a Chairman of the Board, who may or may not also be an officer of
the Corporation. The Board may elect or appoint co-Chairmen of the Board, co-
Presidents or co-Chief Executive Officers and, in such case, references in
these By-Laws to the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Chief
Executive Officer shall refer to either such co-Chairman of the Board, co-
President or co-Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 2. All officers of the Corporation elected by the Board shall
hold office for such terms as may be determined by the Board or, except with
respect to his or her own office, the Chief Executive Officer, or until their
respective successors are chosen and qualified or until his or her earlier
resignation or removal. Any officer may be removed from office at any time

the Board or such appointing officer, shall have such further powers and
duties as ordinarily pertain to that office.

Article IV. 
 INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

  



  

Section 1. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be
made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative or any other type whatsoever (hereinafter a "
_proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
an officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an " _indemnitee_ "), whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director, officer, employee, agent or trustee or in any other capacity while
serving as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee, shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights
than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment),
against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments,
fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith;
except as provided in Section 3 of this Article IV with respect to proceedings
to enforce rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses or with
respect to any compulsory counterclaim brought by such indemnitee, the
Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



  

Section 2. In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in
Section 1 of this Article IV, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be
paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred in
appearing at, participating in or defending any such proceeding in advance of
its final disposition or in connection with a proceeding brought to establish
or enforce a right to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this
Article IV (which shall be governed by Section 3 of this Article IV)
(hereinafter an " _advancement of expenses_ "); _provided, however_ , that, if
(x) the DGCL requires or (y) in the case of an advance made in a proceeding
brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or advancement, an
advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) shall be made solely upon delivery to the Corporation
of an undertaking (hereinafter an " _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such
indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined after final judicial decision from which there is no further right
to appeal (hereinafter a " _final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is
not entitled to indemnification under this Article IV or otherwise.

  



  

Section 3. If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article IV is not paid
in full by the Corporation within (i) sixty (60) days after a written claim
for indemnification has been received by the Corporation or (ii) twenty (20)
days after a claim for an advancement of expenses has been received by the
Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against
the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim or to obtain
advancement of expenses, as applicable. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, if the indemnitee is successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or
in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to
be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any
suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to
enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense of the
Corporation that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee
of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that
indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the
indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including by its directors
who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the
indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of
such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden
of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such
advancement of expenses, under this Article IV or otherwise shall be on the
Corporation.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

Section 4.

  



  

(A) The provision of indemnification to or the advancement of
expenses and costs to any indemnitee under this Article IV, or the
entitlement of any indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of expenses
and costs under this Article IV, shall not limit or restrict in any way the
power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such
indemnitee in any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or
invalidate, any right to which any indemnitee seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled under any law, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in such indemnitee's capacity as an officer, director, employee or
agent of the Corporation and as to action in any other capacity.

  



  

(B) Given that certain jointly indemnifiable claims (as defined
below) may arise due to the service of the indemnitee as a director
and/or officer of the Corporation or as a director, officer, employee, agent
or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise at the request of the indemnitee-related entities (as
defined below), the Corporation shall be fully and primarily responsible for
the payment to the indemnitee in respect of indemnification or advancement of
expenses in connection with any such jointly indemnifiable claims, pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of this Article IV, irrespective of any
right of recovery the indemnitee may have from the indemnitee-related
entities. Under no circumstance shall the Corporation be entitled to any
right of subrogation against or contribution by the indemnitee-related
entities and no right of advancement, indemnification or recovery the
indemnitee may have from the indemnitee-related entities shall reduce or
otherwise alter the rights of the indemnitee or the obligations of the
Corporation under this Article IV. In the event that any of the indemnitee-
related entities shall make any payment to the indemnitee in respect of
indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to any jointly
indemnifiable claim, the indemnitee-related entity making such payment shall
be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery
of the indemnitee against the Corporation, and the indemnitee shall execute
all papers reasonably required and shall do all things that may be reasonably
necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents as
may be necessary to enable the indemnitee-related entities effectively to
bring suit to enforce such rights. Each of the indemnitee-related entities
shall be third-party beneficiaries with respect to this Section 4(B) of
Article IV, entitled to enforce this Section 4(B) of Article IV.

  



  

For purposes of this Section 4(B) of Article IV, the following terms shall
have the following meanings:

  



  

(1) The term " _indemnitee-related entities_ " means any corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise (other than the Corporation or any other
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise for which the indemnitee has agreed,
on behalf of the Corporation or at the Corporation's request, to serve as a
director, officer, employee or agent and which service is covered by the
indemnity described herein) from whom an indemnitee may be entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to which, in whole or
in part, the Corporation may also have an indemnification or advancement
obligation.

  



  

(2) The term " _jointly indemnifiable claims_ " shall be broadly
construed and shall include, without limitation, any action, suit or
proceeding for which the indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses from both the indemnitee-related entities and the
Corporation pursuant to applicable law, any agreement, certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement,
certificate of formation, certificate of limited partnership or comparable
organizational documents of the Corporation or the indemnitee-related
entities, as applicable.

  



  

Section 5. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article IV shall
be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the
indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration
or repeal of this Article IV that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee
or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit, eliminate,
or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding involving
any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that
took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

Section 6. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 7. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to
time by the Board, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of
the provisions of this Article IV with respect to the indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

  



  

Article V. 
 CORPORATE BOOKS

  



  

The books of the Corporation may be kept inside or outside of the State of
Delaware at such place or places as the Board may from time to time determine.

  



  

Article VI. 
 CHECKS, NOTES, PROXIES, ETC.

  



  

All checks and drafts on the Corporation's bank accounts and all bills of
exchange and promissory notes, and all acceptances, obligations and
other instruments for the payment of money, shall be signed by such officer
or officers or agent or agents as shall be authorized from time to time by
the Board or such officer or officers who may be delegated such authority.
Proxies to vote and consents with respect to securities of other corporations
or other entities owned by or standing in the name of the Corporation may be
executed and delivered from time to time on behalf of the Corporation by the
Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or by such officers
as the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer or the Board may from
time to time determine.

  



  

Article VII. 
 SHARES AND OTHER SECURITIES OF THE CORPORATION

  



  

Section 1. _Certificated and Uncertificated Shares_. The shares of the
Corporation may be certificated or uncertificated, subject to the sole
discretion of the Board and the requirements of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 2. _Signatures_. Each certificate representing capital stock of
the Corporation shall be signed by or in the name of the Corporation by any
two authorized officers of the Corporation, which authorized officers shall
include, without limitation, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive
Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the
Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Corporation. Any or all of the
signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer,
transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has
been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer
agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, such certificate may be
issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such
officer, transfer agent or registrar on the date of issue.

  



  

Section 3. _Lost, Destroyed or Wrongfully Taken Certificates_.

  



  

(A) If an owner of a certificate representing shares claims that
such certificate has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the
Corporation shall issue a new certificate representing such shares or such
shares in uncertificated form if the owner: (i) requests such a new
certificate before the Corporation has notice that the certificate
representing such shares has been acquired by a protected purchaser; (ii) if
requested by the Corporation, delivers to the Corporation a bond sufficient to
indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the
Corporation on account of the alleged loss, wrongful taking or destruction of
such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated
shares; and (iii) satisfies other reasonable requirements imposed by the
Corporation.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(B) If a certificate representing shares has been lost, apparently
destroyed or wrongfully taken, and the owner fails to notify the
Corporation of that fact within a reasonable time after the owner has notice
of such loss, apparent destruction or wrongful taking and the Corporation
registers a transfer of such shares before receiving notification, the owner
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be precluded from asserting
against the Corporation any claim for registering such transfer or a claim to
a new certificate representing such shares or such shares in uncertificated
form.

  



  

Section 4. _Transfer of Stock_.

  



  

(A) Transfers of record of shares of stock of the Corporation
shall be made only upon the books administered by or on behalf of the
Corporation and only upon proper transfer instructions, including by
Electronic Transmission, pursuant to the direction of the registered holder
thereof, such person's attorney lawfully constituted in writing, or from an
individual presenting proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority
to transfer the shares of stock; or, in the case of stock represented by
certificate(s) upon delivery of a properly endorsed certificate(s) for a like
number of shares or accompanied by a duly executed stock transfer power.

  



  

(B) The Corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any
agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock
of the corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the
Corporation of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any
manner not prohibited by the DGCL.

  



  

Section 5. _Registered Stockholders_. Before due presentment for
registration of transfer of a certificate representing shares of the
Corporation or of an instruction requesting registration of transfer of
uncertificated shares, the Corporation may treat the registered owner as the
person exclusively entitled to inspect for any proper purpose the stock ledger
and the other books and records of the Corporation, vote such shares, receive
dividends or notifications with respect to such shares and otherwise exercise
all the rights and powers of the owner of such shares, except that a person
who is the beneficial owner of such shares (if held in a voting trust or by
a nominee on behalf of such person) may, upon providing documentary evidence
of beneficial ownership of such shares and satisfying such other conditions
as are provided under applicable law, may also so inspect the books and
records of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 6. _Regulations_. The Board shall have power and authority to
make such additional rules and regulations, subject to any applicable
requirement of law, as the Board may deem necessary and appropriate with
respect to the issue, transfer or registration of transfer of shares of stock
or certificates representing shares. The Board may appoint one or more
transfer agents or registrars and may require for the validity thereof that
certificates representing shares bear the signature of any transfer agent or
registrar so appointed.

empowered committee thereof, a facsimile thereof may be impressed or affixed

Article X. 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

Section 1. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or under any
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, notice of
any meeting need not be given to any person who shall attend such meeting
(except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened), or who shall waive
notice thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing (including by
electronic transmission).

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

Section 2. Means of Giving Notice. Except as otherwise set forth in any
applicable law or any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or
these By-Laws, notice of any meeting shall be given by the following means:

  



  

(A) _Notice to Directors_. Whenever under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws notice is required to be
given to any director, such notice shall be given either (i) in writing and
sent by mail, or by a nationally recognized delivery service, (ii) by means
of facsimile telecommunication or other form of electronic transmission, or
(iii) by oral notice given personally or by telephone. A notice to a director
will be deemed given as follows: (i) if given by hand delivery, orally, or by
telephone, when actually received by the director, (ii) if sent through the
United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage
and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the director's address
appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day
delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, when
deposited with such service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the
director at the director's address appearing on the records of the
Corporation, (iv) if sent by facsimile telecommunication, when sent to the
facsimile transmission number for such director appearing on the records of
the Corporation, (v) if sent by electronic mail, when sent to the
electronic mail address for such director appearing on the records of the
Corporation, or (vi) if sent by any other form of electronic transmission,
when sent to the address, location or number (as applicable) for such director
appearing on the records of the Corporation.

  



  

(B) _Electronic Transmission_. " _Electronic transmission_ " means
any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission
of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed
by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by
such a recipient through an automated process.

  



  

(C) _Notice to Stockholders Sharing Same Address_. Without
limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively by
the Corporation to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the
Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation
or these By-Laws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to
stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that
address to whom such notice is given. A stockholder may revoke such
stockholder's consent by delivering written notice of such revocation to the
Corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to
the Corporation within 60 days of having been given written notice by the
Corporation of its intention to send such a single written notice shall be
deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.

  



  

(D) _Exceptions to Notice Requirements_.

  



  

(1) Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to any person with whom
communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not
be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority
or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any
action or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to any such
person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and
effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action
taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate
with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such
is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons
entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is
unlawful.

  



  

(2) Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation,
under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-
Laws, to any stockholder to whom (x) notice of two consecutive annual
meetings of stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings or of the
taking of action by written consent of stockholders without a meeting to such
stockholder during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings,
or (y) all, and at least two payments (if sent by first-class mail) of
dividends or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been
mailed addressed to such stockholder at such stockholder's address as
shown on the records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable,
the giving of such notice to such stockholder shall not be required. Any
action or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to such
stockholder shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been
duly given. If any such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written
notice setting forth such stockholder's then current address, the requirement
that notice be given to such stockholder shall be reinstated. In the event
that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a
certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not
state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to
be given pursuant to Section 230 (b) of the DGCL. The exception in subsection
(x) of the first sentence of this paragraph to the requirement that notice be
given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the
notice was given by electronic transmission.

inconsistent with any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or the
DGCL, the provision of these By-laws shall not be given any effect to the
extent of such inconsistency but shall otherwise be given full force and
effect.

Article IV 
 OWNERSHIP AND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

  



  

Section 4.1 _Authorized Units; General Provisions with Respect
to Units_.

  



  

(a) _Units_. Subject to the provisions of this LLC Agreement, the
Company shall be authorized to issue from time to time such number of
Common Units and Equity Securities, as the Managing Member shall determine in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions in this  _Section 4.1_ and
_Section 4.3_. Subject to this _Section 4.1_ and _Section 4.3_,
each authorized Unit may be issued pursuant to such agreements as the
Managing Member shall approve, including pursuant to warrants, options, or
other rights or property to acquire Units or that may be converted into Units.
The Company may reissue any Units that have been repurchased or acquired by
the Company; _provided_ that any such issuance, and the admission of any
Person as a Member in connection therewith, is otherwise made in accordance
with and subject to the restrictions in this LLC Agreement. The Units shall
be uncertificated. The Company shall not, and the Managing Member shall not
cause the Company to, issue any Units if such issuance would result in the
Company having more than 100 partners, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h) (determined taking into account the rules of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)); _provided_ that, for such
purposes, the Company and the Managing Member shall be entitled to assume
that each Continuing Member is treated as a single partner within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h) (determined taking into account
the rules of Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)), unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(b) _Outstanding Units_. Each Continuing Member previously was
admitted as a Member and shall remain a Member of the Company at the
Effective Time. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Units will comprise
(i) a single class of Common Units and (ii) a single class of Restricted
Common Units. Except as otherwise provided in this LLC Agreement, each
outstanding Common Unit shall be identical, and each outstanding Restricted
Common Unit shall be identical. The Managing Member's interest in its capacity
as such shall be a non-economic interest in the Company, which does not
entitle the Managing Member, solely in its capacity as such, to any
Common Units, Ordinary Distributions or Tax Distributions.

  



  

(c) _Schedule of Members_. The Company shall maintain a schedule,
appended hereto as __Exhibit A__ (as updated and amended from time to time
in accordance with the terms of this LLC Agreement and current as of the date
set forth therein), which shall include: (i) the name and address of each
Member; (ii) the aggregate number of and type of Units issued and
outstanding and held by each Member; and (iii) each Member's Capital
Contributions following the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _Restricted Common Units_. Each Restricted Common Unit will
be held in accordance with this LLC Agreement unless and until an
applicable Vesting Event occurs with respect to such Restricted Common Unit.
Upon the occurrence of a Vesting Event, on the Conversion Date, those
Restricted Common Units to which such Vesting Event relates will be
immediately converted into an equal number of Common Units, with all rights
and privileges of a Common Unit under this LLC Agreement from and after the
Conversion Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) upon the occurrence of a
First Tier Vesting Event, if ever, 50% of each of the Continuing Members'
and PubCo's Restricted Common Units issued and outstanding as of the date of
such occurrence will vest, become entitled to receive the Distribution Catch-
Up Payment with respect to such Restricted Common Units and convert
immediately into an equal number of Common Units, (ii) upon the occurrence of
a Second Tier Vesting Event, if ever, the remaining 50% of each of the
Continuing Members' and PubCo's Restricted Common Units issued and
outstanding as of the date of the occurrence of a First Tier Vesting Event
(after giving effect to any subdivision (by any equity split, equity
distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination
(by reverse equity split, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise))
will vest, become entitled to receive the Distribution Catch-Up Payment with
respect to such Restricted Common Units and convert immediately into an
equal number of Common Units (such that following the occurrence of a Second
Tier Vesting Event no Restricted Common Units remain outstanding), and (iii)
upon the occurrence of a Continuing Member COC or Sponsor COC, 100% of each of
the Continuing Members' and/or PubCo's, as applicable, Restricted Common
Units then outstanding, respectively, will vest, become entitled to receive
the Distribution Catch-Up Payment with respect to such Restricted Common
Units and convert immediately into an equal number of Common Units (such that
following the occurrence of a Continuing Member COC, no Continuing Member will
hold any Restricted Common Units and following the occurrence of a Sponsor
COC, PubCo will not hold any Restricted Common Units). If a First Tier Vesting
Event has not occurred at the time of the occurrence of a Second Tier Vesting
Event, such First Tier Vesting Event shall also occur upon the occurrence of
the Second Tier Vesting Event, such that all of the then outstanding
Restricted Common Units shall vest in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
LLC Agreement, if, upon the occurrence of a Vesting Event, a filing is
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 ("
_HSR Act_ ") for the immediate conversion of any Restricted Common Unit into
an equal number of Common Units, then the Conversion Date with respect to all
Restricted Common Units which would convert into an equal number of Common
Units resulting from such Vesting Event shall be delayed until the earlier of
(i) such time as the required filing under the HSR Act has been made and the
waiting period applicable to such conversion under the HSR Act shall have
expired or been terminated or (ii) such filing is no longer required, at
which time such conversion shall automatically occur without any further
action by the holders of any such Restricted Common Unit. Each of the
Continuing Members and PubCo agree to promptly take all actions required to
make such filing under the HSR Act and the filing fee for such filing shall
be paid by the Company. On the Conversion Date with respect to any
Restricted Common Unit held by a Continuing Member, PubCo shall issue, for
each Restricted Common Unit which has converted to a Common Unit under this
LLC Agreement, one share of Class V Common Stock to such Continuing Member.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a subdivision or combination
referred to in _Section 4.1(i)(i)_ or _Section 4(i)(ii)_, the number of
shares of Class V Common Stock to which a Continuing Member shall be entitled
upon vesting of its Restricted Common Units shall equal the number of
Restricted Common Units held by the Continuing Members as a result of such
subdivision or combination that have converted into Common Units. PubCo
hereby agrees to reserve for issuance at all times an adequate number of
shares of Class V Common Stock to permit the issuance of all Class V Common
Stock assuming all of the Continuing Members' Restricted Common Units vest
under this LLC Agreement. To the extent that, on or before the tenth (10th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, a Vesting Event has not occurred with
respect to a Restricted Common Unit, and a Restricted Common Unit has not
vested and converted into a Common Unit under this LLC Agreement, then
immediately and without any further action under this LLC Agreement, on the
date that is the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Time, all such
Restricted Common Units outstanding under this LLC Agreement shall be
canceled and extinguished for no consideration.

under PubCo's employee benefit plans of any warrants, options, stock
appreciation right, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
based award or other rights to acquire Equity Securities of PubCo or rights or

as set forth in _clause (iii)_ below, as applicable).

  



  

(iii) In the event any outstanding Equity Security of PubCo is
exercised or otherwise converted and, as a result, any shares of Class
A Common Stock or other Equity Securities of PubCo are issued (including as a
result of the exercise of PubCo Warrants), (x) the corresponding Equity
Security outstanding at the Company, if any, shall be similarly exercised or
otherwise converted, if applicable, (y) an equivalent number of Common Units
or equivalent Equity Securities of the Company shall be issued to PubCo as
required by the first sentence of _Section 4.1(e)(i)_, and (z) PubCo shall
concurrently contribute to the Company the net proceeds received by PubCo

such Debt Securities in a manner that directly or indirectly burdens the
Company with the repayment of the Debt Securities, subject to the second
proviso in _Section 7.8_.

  



  

(g) _New Company Issuances._ Except pursuant to _Section 4.6_,
(x) the Company may not issue any additional Units to PubCo or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) unless (i)
substantially simultaneously therewith PubCo or such Subsidiary issues or
transfers an equal number of newly-issued shares of Class A Common Stock (or
relevant Equity Security of such Subsidiary) to another Person or Persons,

5.2_, (ii) the amount of cash or the initial Gross Asset Value of any asset
(net of any Liabilities assumed by the Company and any Liabilities to which
the asset is subject) contributed to the Company by such Member, and (iii) any
other increases allowed or required by Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), and (b) decreased by (i) allocations to such Member of
Losses pursuant to _Section 5.1_ and any other items of deduction or loss
allocated to such Member pursuant to the provisions of _Section 5.2_, (ii)
the amount of any cash or the Gross Asset Value of any asset (net of any
Liabilities assumed by the Member and any Liabilities to which the asset is
subject) distributed to such Member, and (iii) any other decreases allowed or
required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Upon the
conversion of any Restricted Common Units into Common Units upon a Vesting
Event, the parties intend that the allocations and capital maintenance rules
shall be governed under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3 with adjustments
being made in accordance with principles similar to those set forth in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s) and consistent with the
principles of Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder in order to effectuate the Members' agreed upon economic sharing of
items within the Company. In the event of a Transfer of Units made in
accordance with this LLC Agreement (including a deemed Transfer for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as described in _Section 4.6(i)_, the Capital
Account of the Transferor that is attributable to the Transferred Units shall
carry over to the Transferee Member in accordance with the provisions of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _l_ ). This _Section 4.4_
and other provisions of this LLC Agreement relating to the maintenance of
Capital Accounts are intended to comply with the Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Code Section 704(b), including Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent
with such Treasury Regulations. In determining the amount of any Liability
for purposes of calculating Capital Accounts, there shall be taken into
account Section 752(c) of the Code and any other applicable provisions of the
Code and Treasury Regulations. The Members' Capital Accounts will normally be
adjusted on an annual or other periodic basis as determined by the
Managing Member, but the Capital Accounts may be adjusted more often if a new
Member is admitted to the Company or if circumstances otherwise make it
advisable in the judgment of the Managing Member.

  



  

Section 4.5 _Other Matters Regarding Capital Contributions_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall not be obligated to repay any Capital
Contributions of any Member. Under circumstances requiring a return of
any Capital Contributions, no Member has the right to receive property other
than cash.

(b) No Member shall receive any interest, salary, compensation or
reimbursement with respect to its Capital Contributions or its
Capital Account, or for services rendered or expenses incurred on behalf of
the Company or otherwise in its capacity as a Member, except as otherwise
provided in _Section 7.8_ or other provisions of this LLC Agreement.

  



  

(c) A Member shall not be required to restore a deficit balance in
such Member's Capital Account, to lend any funds to the Company or, except as
otherwise set forth in this LLC Agreement, to make any additional
contributions or payments to the Company.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Exchange of Common Units_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
_Section 4.6_, after the expiration of the Lock-Up Period (as defined in the
Investor Rights Agreement), the Exchanging Members shall collectively be
entitled to cause the Company to effect an Exchange up to two (2) times per
calendar quarter (and no more frequently), in each case with respect to a
number of Common Units at least equal to or exceeding the Minimum Exchange
Amount, by delivering an Exchange Notice to the Company, with a copy to
PubCo. Each Exchange Notice shall be in the form set forth on __Exhibit B__
and shall include all information required to be included therein. In the
event that an Exchange is being exercised in order to participate in a
Piggyback Registration (as such term is defined in the Investor Rights
Agreement), the Exchange Notice Date shall be prior to the expiration of the
time period in which a holder of securities is required to notify PubCo that
it wishes to participate in such Piggyback Registration in accordance with
Section 3.2 of the Investor Rights Agreement.

  



  

(ii) Within three (3) Business Days of the giving of an Exchange
Notice, the Managing Member may elect to settle all or a portion of the
Exchange in cash in an amount equal to the Cash Exchange Payment (in lieu of
shares of Class A Common Stock), exercisable by giving written notice of such
election to the Exchanging Member within such three (3) Business Day period
(such notice, the " _Cash Exchange Notice_ "). The Cash Exchange Notice shall
set forth the portion of the Common Units subject to the Exchange which will
be exchanged for cash in lieu of Class A Common Stock. To the extent such
Exchange relates to the exercise of the Exchanging Member's registration
rights under Section 3.1 of the Investor Rights Agreement, PubCo and the
Company will cooperate in good faith with such Exchanging Member to exercise
such Exchange in a manner which preserves such Exchanging Member's rights
thereunder. At any time following the giving of a Cash Exchange Notice and
prior to the Exchange Date, the Managing Member may elect (exercisable by
giving written notice of such election to the Exchanging Member) to revoke
the Cash Exchange Notice with respect to all or any portion of the Exchanged
Units and make the Stock Exchange Payment with respect to any such Exchanged
Units on the Exchange Date.

  



  

(iii) In the event the Managing Member does not timely give a Cash
Exchange Notice (or revokes a Cash Exchange Notice in accordance with the
foregoing _clause (ii)_ ), the Exchanging Member may, if and only if any
Exchange Condition exists, elect to (x) retract its Exchange Notice or (y)
delay the consummation of an Exchange, in each case, exercisable by giving
written notice of such election to the Managing Member within two (2)
Business Days of the occurrence of an Exchange Condition and in any event no
later than (1) Business Day prior to the Exchange Date (such notice under
_clause (y)_ , an " _Exchange Delay Notice_ "); provided that any such notice
must specify the particular Exchange Condition giving rise to such election.
The giving of any notice pursuant to _clause (x)_ shall terminate all of the
Exchanging Member's, the Managing Member's and Company's rights and
obligations under this _Section 4.6_ arising from such retracted Exchange
Notice, but shall not count against the maximum number of Exchanges that an
Exchanging Member may effect in a calendar quarter.

  



  

   

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv) In the event of a Continuing Member COC, the Managing Member
may elect, pursuant to a written notice given to the Members (other than
PubCo) at least thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of a Continuing
Member COC (a " _COC Notice_ "), to require each such Member to effect an
Exchange with respect to any portion of such Member's Common Units (together
with the surrender and cancellation of the corresponding number of
outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock held by such Member), taking into
account the conversion of such Member's Restricted Common Units into Common
Units as a result of any such Continuing Member COC (any such exchange, a "
_COC Exchange_ ") which shall be effective immediately prior to the
consummation of the Continuing Member COC (but such Exchange shall be
conditioned on the consummation of such Continuing Member COC, and shall not
be effective if such Continuing Member COC is not consummated) (the " _COC
Exchange Date_ "). In connection with a COC Exchange, such Exchange shall be
settled (including, if PubCo elects by delivery of a COC Notice, directly by
PubCo) (x) with the Stock Exchange Payment with respect to the Common Units
subject to the COC Exchange or (y) in cash or property, so long as in each
case each such Member receives the identical consideration, on a per Unit
basis, that the holder of a share of Class A Common Stock would receive in
connection with such Continuing Member COC. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 4.6(a)(iv)_ to the contrary, the Managing Member cannot elect to
require any Member to effect a COC Exchange unless such Member receives,
pursuant to such COC Exchange (including in connection with the consummation
of such Continuing Member COC), (x) consideration consisting entirely of (A)
cash, (B) Equity Securities that (I) are listed on a National Securities
Exchange within sixty (60) days of the consummation of such Continuing Member
COC and (II) can be resold without registration or within sixty (60) days of
the consummation of such Continuing Member COC are registered for resale on a
shelf registration statement under the Securities Act (the Equity Securities
referred to in this _clause (B)_ , the " _Liquid Securities_ "), or (C)  a
combination of cash and Liquid Securities, or (y) consideration that includes
cash and Liquid Securities, the sum of such cash plus the fair market value
of such Liquid Securities is at least equal to the income taxes incurred by
such Member in connection with such COC Exchange (including in connection
with the consummation of such Continuing Member COC), determined on a
"with and without" basis.

  



  

(v) Restricted Common Units are not permitted to be treated as
Exchanged Units under this LLC Agreement, and in no event shall the Company
or PubCo effect an Exchange of a Restricted Common Unit unless and until a
Vesting Event and Conversion Date has occurred with respect to such
Restricted Common Unit and it has been converted to a Common Unit in
accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

   

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(vi) For purposes of this _Section 4.6_ (and defined terms and
provisions related thereto), all decisions, determinations, elections and
other actions to be taken by the Managing Member or PubCo shall require the
approval of the Disinterested Majority.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Payment._ The Exchange shall be consummated on the
Exchange Date. Unless PubCo has exercised its PubCo Call Right pursuant to
_Section 4.6(f)_, on the Exchange Date (to be effective immediately prior to
the close of business on the Exchange Date) (i) PubCo shall contribute to the
Company for delivery to the Exchanging Member (x) the Stock Exchange
Payment with respect to any Exchanged Units not subject to a Cash Exchange
Notice and (y) the Cash Exchange Payment with respect to any Exchanged Units
subject to a Cash Exchange Notice, (ii) the Exchanging Member shall transfer
and surrender the Exchanged Units to the Company, free and clear of all liens
and encumbrances, (iii) the Company shall issue to PubCo a number of
Common Units equal to the number of Common Units surrendered pursuant to
_clause (ii)_ , (iv) solely to the extent necessary in connection with an
Exchange, PubCo shall undertake all actions, including an issuance,
reclassification, distribution, division or recapitalization, with respect to
the Class A Common Stock to maintain a one-to-one ratio between the number of
Common Units owned by PubCo, directly or indirectly, and the number of
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, taking into account the issuance
in _clause (iii)_ , any Stock Exchange Payment, and any other action taken in
connection with this _Section 4.6_, (v) the Company shall (x) cancel the
redeemed Common Units which were Exchanged Units held by the Exchanging
Member and (y) transfer to the Exchanging Member the Cash Exchange Payment
and/or the Stock Exchange Payment, as applicable, and (vi) PubCo shall cancel
the surrendered shares of Class V Common Stock. On or prior to the Exchange
Date, and as a condition to the Exchange, the Exchanging Member shall make
any applicable Certificate Delivery. Upon the Exchange of all of a
Member's Units, such Member shall cease to be a Member of the Company.

  



  

(c) _Splits, Distributions and Reclassifications._ If there is any
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction in which the shares of Class A Common Stock are converted or
changed into another security, securities or other property, this _Section
4.6_ shall continue to be applicable, _mutatis mutandis_ , with respect to
such security or other property. This Section 4.6(c) is intended to preserve
the intended economic effect of Section 4.1 and this Section 4.6 and to put
each Member in the same economic position, to the greatest extent possible,
with respect to Exchanges as if such reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or other similar transaction had not occurred and shall be
interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.

  



  

(d) _PubCo Covenants._ PubCo shall at all times keep available,
solely for the purpose of issuance upon an Exchange, out of its
authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, such number of shares
of Class A Common Stock that shall be issuable upon the Exchange of all
outstanding Common Units and Restricted Common Units (other than those Common
Units and Restricted Common Units held by PubCo or any Subsidiary of PubCo);
_provided_ that nothing contained in this LLC Agreement shall be construed to
preclude PubCo from satisfying its obligations with respect to an Exchange by
delivery of a Cash Exchange Payment or shares of Class A Common Stock that
are held in treasury of PubCo. PubCo covenants that all shares of Class A
Common Stock that shall be issued upon an Exchange shall, upon issuance
thereof, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances. In addition, for so long as the shares of Class A
Common Stock are listed on a stock exchange or automated or electronic
quotation system, PubCo shall cause all shares of Class A Common Stock issued
upon an Exchange to be listed on such stock exchange or automated or
electronic quotation system at the time of such issuance. For purposes of
this _Section 4.6(d)_, references to the "Class A Common Stock" shall be
deemed to include any Equity Securities issued or issuable as a result of any
reclassification, combination, subdivision or similar transaction of the Class
A Common Stock that any Member would be entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 4.6(c)_.

  



  

   

 | 31| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Exchange Taxes._ The issuance of shares of Class A Common
Stock upon an Exchange shall be made without charge to the Exchanging Member
for any stamp or other similar tax in respect of such issuance; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such shares of Class A Common Stock are to be issued
in a name other than that of the Exchanging Member (subject to the
restrictions in _Article IX_), then the Person or Persons in whose name the
shares are to be issued shall pay to PubCo the amount of any additional tax
that may be payable in respect of any Transfer involved in such issuance in
excess of the amount otherwise due if such shares were issued in the name of
the Exchanging Member or shall establish to the satisfaction of PubCo that
such additional tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(f) _PubCo Call Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 4.6_, with respect to any Exchange Notice or COC
Notice, an Exchanging Member shall be deemed to have offered to sell its
Exchanged Units as described in any Exchange Notice directly to PubCo (rather
than to the Company), and PubCo may, by delivery of a written notice to the
Exchanging Member no later than three (3) Business Days following the giving
of an Exchange Notice, in accordance with, and subject to the terms of, this
_Section 4.6(f)_ (such notice, a " _PubCo Call Notice_ "), elect to
purchase directly and acquire such Exchanged Units on the Exchange Date by
paying to the Exchanging Member (or such other Person specified in the
Exchange Notice) the Stock Exchange Payment and/or the Cash Exchange Payment,
whereupon PubCo shall acquire the Exchanged Units on the Exchange Date and be
treated for all purposes of this LLC Agreement as the owner of such Common
Units. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 4.6(f)_, an exercise of
the PubCo Call Right shall be consummated pursuant to the same timeframe and
in the same manner as the relevant Exchange would have been consummated if
PubCo had not given a PubCo Call Notice, in each case as relevant, including
that _Section 4.6(a)(ii)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ and that  _clauses
(iv)_ and _(vi)_ of _Section 4.6(b)_ shall apply (notwithstanding that the
other clauses thereof do not apply).

  



  

(g) _Distribution Rights_. No Exchange shall impair the right of
the Exchanging Member to receive any distributions payable on the Common
Units redeemed pursuant to such Exchange in respect of a record date that
occurs prior to the Exchange Date for such Exchange. No Exchanging Member, or
a Person designated by an Exchanging Member to receive shares of Class A
Common Stock, shall be entitled to receive, with respect to such record date,
distributions or dividends both on Common Units redeemed by the Company from
such Exchanging Member and on shares of Class A Common Stock received by such
Exchanging Member, or other Person so designated, if applicable, in such
Exchange.

  



  

   

 | 32| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) _Exchange Restrictions_. The Managing Member may impose
additional limitations and restrictions on Exchanges (including limiting
Exchanges or creating priority procedures for Exchanges) to the extent it
reasonably determines in good faith that such limitations and restrictions
are necessary to avoid the Company being classified as a "publicly traded
partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code; _provided_ that,
for such purposes, the Company and the Managing Member shall assume that each
Continuing Member is treated as a single partner within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h) (determined taking into account the
rules of Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)), unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

  



  

(i) _Tax Matters_. In connection with any Exchange or COC Notice,
the Exchanging Member shall deliver to PubCo or the Company, as applicable, a
certificate, dated as of the Exchange Date and sworn under penalties of
perjury, in a form reasonably acceptable to PubCo or the Company, as
applicable, certifying as to such Exchanging Member's taxpayer identification
number and that such Exchanging Member is a not a foreign person for purposes
of Section 1445 and Section 1446(f) of the Code (which certificate may be an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 if then sufficient for such purposes under
applicable Law). For U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax
purposes, each of the Exchanging Member, the Company and PubCo agree to treat
each Exchange as a sale by the Exchanging Member of the Exchanging Member's
Common Units (together with an equal number of shares of Class V Common
Stock, which shares shall not be allocated any economic value) to PubCo in
exchange for the payment by PubCo of the Stock Exchange Payment, the Cash
Exchange Payment, or other applicable consideration to the Exchanging Member.

  



  

(j) _Representations and Warranties_. In connection with any
Exchange or exercise of a PubCo Call Right, upon the acceptance of the Class
A Common Stock or an amount of cash equal to the Cash Exchange Payment, the
Exchanging Member shall represent and warrant that the Exchanging Member is
the owner of the number of Common Units the Exchanging Member is electing to
Exchange and that such Common Units are not subject to any liens or
restrictions on transfer (other than restrictions imposed by this LLC
Agreement, the charter and governing documents of PubCo and applicable Law).

  



  

Section 4.7 _Representations and Warranties of the Members_. Unless
otherwise set forth in a written agreement between the Company and a
Member (including the Business Combination Agreement), each Member who
acquires Units after the Effective Time severally (and not
jointly) represents and warrants to the Company and each other Member as of
the date of such Member's admittance to the Company and as of each subsequent
date that such Member acquires any additional Units (other than, in the case
of acquisition of additional Units, _Section 4.7(b)_ to the extent any
conflict under _Section 4.7(b)_ is related to the occurrence of a Change of
Control resulting from such acquisition) that:

(b) _Non-Contravention_.

  



  

(i) Its authorization, execution, delivery, and performance of

bound or (z) applicable Law.

  



  

(ii) No governmental, administrative or other material third party
consents or approvals are required or necessary on the part of it
in connection with its admittance as a Member or its ownership of its Units.

  



  

(c) _Due Inquiry_.

  



  

(i) It has had, prior to the execution and delivery of this LLC

agrees that, if in the future it decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise

qualification under the Securities Act and applicable state securities Laws,

Article V 
 ALLOCATIONS OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

  



  

Section 5.1 _Profits and Losses_. After giving effect to the
allocations under _Section 5.2 _and subject to _Section 5.2 _and _Section
5.4_, Profits and Losses (and, to the extent reasonably determined by the
Managing Member to be necessary and appropriate to achieve the resulting
Capital Account balances described below, any allocable items of income, gain,
loss, deduction or credit includable in the computation of Profits and
Losses) for each Taxable Year or other taxable period shall be allocated
among the Members during such Taxable Year or other taxable period in a manner
such that, after giving effect to all distributions through the end of such
Taxable Year or other taxable period, the Capital Account balance of each
Member, immediately after making such allocation, is, as nearly as possible,
equal to (a) the amount such Member would receive pursuant to _Section
11.3(b)(iii)_ if all assets of the Company on hand at the end of such Taxable
Year or other taxable period were sold for cash equal to their Gross Asset
Values, all liabilities of the Company were satisfied in cash in accordance
with their terms (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the
Gross Asset Value of the assets securing such liability), and all remaining or
resulting cash was distributed, in accordance with _Section 11.3(b)(iii)_,
to the Members immediately after making such allocation, _minus _ (b) such
Member's share of Company Minimum Gain and Member Minimum Gain, computed
immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of assets, and the amount any such
Member is treated as obligated to contribute to the Company, computed
immediately after the hypothetical sale of assets.

  



  

   

 | 35| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 5.2 _Special Allocations_.

  



  

(a) Nonrecourse Deductions for any Taxable Year or other taxable
period shall be specially allocated to the Members on a _pro rata_ basis in
accordance with the number of Common Units owned by each Member. The amount of
Nonrecourse Deductions for a Taxable Year or other taxable period shall equal
the excess, if any, of the net increase, if any, in the amount of Company
Minimum Gain during that Taxable Year or other taxable period over the
aggregate amount of any distributions during that Taxable Year or other
taxable period of proceeds of a Nonrecourse Liability that are allocable to
an increase in Company Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with the
provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(d).

  



  

(b) Any Member Nonrecourse Deductions for any Taxable Year or other
taxable period shall be specially allocated to the Member who bears economic
risk of loss with respect to the Member Nonrecourse Debt to which such Member
Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one (1) Member bears the economic
risk of loss for such Member Nonrecourse Debt, the Member Nonrecourse
Deductions attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt shall be
allocated among the Members according to the ratio in which they bear the
economic risk of loss. This _Section 5.2(b)_ is intended to comply with the
provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this LLC Agreement to the
contrary, if there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during any
Taxable Year or other taxable period (or if there was a net decrease in
Company Minimum Gain for a prior Taxable Year or other taxable period and the
Company did not have sufficient amounts of income and gain during prior
periods to allocate among the Members under this _Section 5.2(c)_), each
Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such
Taxable Year or other taxable period in an amount equal to such Member's
share of the net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during such year (as
determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(2)). This
_Section 5.2(c)_ is intended to constitute a minimum gain chargeback under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this LLC Agreement except
_Section 5.2(c)_, if there is a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain during
any Taxable Year or other taxable period (or if there was a net decrease in
Member Minimum Gain for a prior Taxable Year or other taxable period and the
Company did not have sufficient amounts of income and gain during prior
periods to allocate among the Members under this _Section 5.2(d)_), each
Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such
year in an amount equal to such Member's share of the net decrease in Member
Minimum Gain (as determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(4)). This section is intended to constitute a partner nonrecourse
debt minimum gain chargeback under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4)
and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary except
_Section 5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_, no Losses or other items of loss or
expense shall be allocated to any Member to the extent that such allocation
would cause such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or
increase any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) at the end of such
Taxable Year or other taxable period. All Losses and other items of loss and
expense in excess of the limitation set forth in this _Section 5.2(e)_
shall be allocated to the Members who do not have an Adjusted Capital Account
Deficit in proportion to their relative positive Capital Accounts but only to
the extent that such Losses and other items of loss and expense do not cause
any such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit.

  



  

   

 | 36| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary except
_Section 5.2(c)_ and _Section 5.2(d)_, in the event any Member unexpectedly
receives any adjustment, allocation or distribution described in paragraph
(4), (5) or (6) of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), items
of income and gain (consisting of a _pro rata_ portion of each item of
income, including gross income, and gain for the Taxable Year or other taxable
period) shall be specially allocated to such Member in an amount and manner
sufficient to eliminate any Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of that Member as
quickly as possible;  _provided_ that an allocation pursuant to this _Section
5.2(f)_ shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have
an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for
in _Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_ have been tentatively made as if this
_Section 5.2(f)_ were not in this LLC Agreement. This _Section 5.2(f)_ is
intended to constitute a qualified income offset under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

  



  

(g) If any Member has a deficit balance in its Capital Account at
the end of any Taxable Year or other taxable period that is in excess of the
amount that the Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the
penultimate sentence of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and
(i)(5), that Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and
gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; _provided_ that an
allocation pursuant to this _Section 5.2(g)_ shall be made only if and to
the extent that such Member would have a deficit balance in its Capital
Account in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided for in
_Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_ have been made as if _Section 5.2(f)_
and this _Section 5.2(g)_ were not in this LLC Agreement.

  



  

(h) To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any
Company asset pursuant to Code Sections 734(b) or 743(b) is required,
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _m_ )(2) or
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _m_ )(4), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts as a result of a distribution to any Member in complete liquidation
of such Member's Units in the Company, the amount of such adjustment to the
Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment
increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such
basis) and such item of gain or loss shall be allocated to the Members in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) _(m)_ (2)
if such section applies or to the Member to whom such distribution was made
if Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _m_ )(4) applies.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this LLC
Agreement, (1) no allocation (of Profits or Losses or otherwise) shall
be made in respect of any Restricted Common Units in determining Capital
Accounts unless and until such Restricted Common Units are converted into
Common Units upon the occurrence of a Vesting Event and (2) in the event the
Gross Asset Value of any Company asset is adjusted pursuant to _clause
(b)(vi)_ of the definition of Gross Asset Value, any Profits or Losses
resulting from such adjustment shall, in the manner reasonably determined by
the Managing Member, be allocated among the Members (including the Members
who held the Restricted Common Units giving rise to such adjustment) such that
the Capital Account balance relating to each Common Unit (including such
Restricted Common Units that have been converted into Common Units) is equal
in amount immediately after making such allocation, after taking into account
the Distribution Catch-Up Payment, in accordance with principles similar to
those set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _s_ );
_provided_ , that if the foregoing allocations pursuant to _clause (2)_ are
insufficient to cause the Capital Account balance relating to each Common Unit
to be so equal in amount, then the Managing Member, in its reasonable
discretion, shall cause a Capital Account reallocation in accordance with
principles similar to those set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _s_ )(3) to cause the Capital Account balance relating to
each Common Unit to be so equal in amount.

  



  

   

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(j) The allocations set forth in _Sections 5.2(a)_ through _5.2(g)_
(the " _Regulatory Allocations_ ") are intended to comply with certain
requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Article V_ (other than the
Regulatory Allocations), the Regulatory Allocations (and anticipated future
Regulatory Allocations) shall be taken into account in allocating other items
of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Members so that, to the extent
possible, the net amount of such allocation of other items and the Regulatory
Allocations to each Member should be equal to the net amount that would have
been allocated to each such Member if the Regulatory Allocations had not
occurred. In general, the Members anticipate that this shall be accomplished
by specially allocating other Profits and Loss among the Members so that the
net amount of Regulatory Allocations and such special allocations to each such
Member is zero. This _Section 5.2(j)_ is intended to minimize to the extent
possible and to the extent necessary any economic distortions that may result
from application of the Regulatory Allocations and shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent therewith.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Allocations for Tax Purposes in General_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 5.3_, each item
of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Company for U.S. federal income
tax purposes shall be allocated among the Members in the same manner as such
item is allocated under _Sections 5.1_  and _5.2_ _._

  



  

(b) In accordance with Code Section 704(c) and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (including the Treasury Regulations applying the
principles of Code Section 704(c) to changes in Gross Asset Values), items of
income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any Company property having
a Gross Asset Value that differs from such property's adjusted U.S. federal
income tax basis shall, solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be
allocated among the Members to account for any such difference using (i) the
"traditional method" without curative allocations under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-3(b) or (ii) any other permissible method or methods determined
by the Managing Member (with the prior written consent of the
Continuing Member Representative) to be appropriate and in accordance with
the applicable Treasury Regulations.

  



  

(c) Any (i) recapture of depreciation or any other item of deduction
shall be allocated, in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections
1.1245-1(e) and 1.1254-5, to the Members who received the benefit of such
deductions and (ii) tax credits, tax credit recapture, and any items related
thereto shall be allocated to the Members according to their interests in such
items as reasonably determined by the Managing Member taking into account the
principles of Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(4)(ii), 1.704-1(b)(3)(iv), and 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii).

  



  

   

 | 38| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Allocations pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ are solely for
purposes of U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and shall not
affect or in any way be taken into account in computing any Member's Capital
Account or share of Profits, Losses, other items or distributions pursuant to
any provision of this LLC Agreement.

  



  

(e) If, as a result of an exercise of a noncompensatory option to
acquire an interest in the Company, a Capital Account reallocation
is required under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _s_ )(3),
the Company shall make corrective allocations pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x). If, pursuant to Section 5.2(i), the
Managing Member causes a Capital Account reallocation in accordance with
principles similar to those set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _s_ )(3), the Managing Member shall make corrective
allocations in accordance with principles similar to those set forth in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

  



  

(f) Any adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of Company property
pursuant to Code Section 743(b) resulting from a transfer of Units shall be
handled in accordance with Treasury Regulations section 1.743-1(j).

  



  

Section 5.4 _Other Allocation Rules_.

  



  

(a) The Members are aware of the income tax consequences of the
allocations made by this _Article V_ and the economic impact of the
allocations on the amounts receivable by them under this LLC Agreement. The
Members hereby agree to be bound by the provisions of this _Article V_ in
reporting their share of Company income and loss for U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income tax purposes.

  



  

(b) The provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance for
each Member of a Capital Account as provided by _Section 4.4 _and the
allocations set forth in _Sections 5.1_, _5.2_ and _5.3_ are intended to
comply with the Treasury Regulations and to reflect the intended economic
entitlement of the Members. If the Managing Member reasonably determines
that the application of the provisions in _Sections 4.4_ , _5.1_ , _5.2_ or
_5.3_ would result in non-compliance with the Treasury Regulations or would
be inconsistent with the intended economic entitlement of the Members, the
Managing Member is authorized to make any appropriate adjustments to such
provisions to the extent permitted by applicable Law, including to
allocate properly items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit to those
Members who bear the economic burden or benefit associated therewith, or to
otherwise cause the Members to achieve the economic objectives underlying this
LLC Agreement and the Business Combination Agreement. The Managing Member
also shall (i) make any adjustments that it reasonably determines are
necessary or appropriate to maintain equality between the Capital Accounts of
the Members and the amount of Company capital reflected on the Company's
balance sheet, as computed for book purposes, in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(iv)(g) and (ii) make any reasonable and
appropriate modifications in the event unanticipated events would reasonably
be expected to otherwise cause this LLC Agreement not to comply with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b). No adjustment to the allocations shall be
made under this Section 5.4(b) without the prior written consent of the
Continuing Members that would be materially adversely affected thereby, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

   

 | 39| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) With regard to PubCo's acquisition of the Acquired Company Units
and the Acquired Restricted Company Units (in each case, as defined in the
Business Combination Agreement), Profits or Losses shall be allocated to the
Members of the Company so as to take into account the varying interests of
the Members in the Company using an "interim closing of the books" method
in a manner that complies with the provisions of Section 706 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder. If during any Taxable Year there is any
other change in any Member's Units in the Company, the Managing Member shall
consult in good faith with the Continuing Member Representative and the tax
advisors to the Company and allocate the Profits or Losses to the Members of
the Company so as to take into account the varying interests of the Members in
the Company using an "interim closing of the books" method in a manner that
complies with the provisions of Section 706 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder; provided, however, that such allocations may
instead be made in another manner that complies with the provisions of
Section 706 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and that is
selected by the Managing Member (with the prior written consent of the
Continuing Member Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

  



  

(d) Solely for purposes of determining a Member's proportionate
share of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of the Company, within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3), the Managing Member
shall allocate such liabilities in such manner that complies with the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and that the Managing Member
reasonably determines, in a manner intended to minimize any gain of the
Members to the greatest extent possible under Section 731 of the Code.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Restricted Common Units_. The Parties intend that, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, (a) the Restricted Common Units received by
the Continuing Members in connection with the Recapitalization and by PubCo in
connection with the Business Combination Agreement not be treated as being
received in connection with the performance of services and (b) no such Member
be treated as having taxable income or gain as a result of such receipt of
such Restricted Common Units or as a result of holding any such Restricted
Common Units at the time of any Vesting Event (other than as a result of
corrective allocations made pursuant to Section 5.2(i)) and the Company shall
prepare and file all tax returns consistent therewith unless otherwise
required by a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code.
Notwithstanding (and without limiting) the foregoing, each of the
Continuing Members and PubCo shall, within thirty (30) days of the Effective
Time, file with the IRS (via certified mail, return receipt requested) on a
protective basis a completed election under Section 83(b) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder with respect to such Restricted Common Units
so received, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ and, upon
such filing, shall thereafter notify the Company that such Member has made
such timely filing and provide the Company with a copy of such election.

Article VI 
 DISTRIBUTIONS

  



  

Section 6.1 _Distributions_.

  



  

(a) _Distributions_. Effective as of the Effective Time, the Board
has caused the Company to adopt a distribution policy in the form attached to
this LLC Agreement as __Exhibit D__ (the " _Distribution Policy_ "), which
may be revised or amended by the Board. Unless prohibited by applicable Law,
and except as otherwise provided in _Section 11.3_ in the event of a
dissolution, distributions to Members holding Common Units shall be declared
by the Managing Member and paid as determined in good faith by the Managing
Member in accordance with the Distribution Policy from available cash,
available borrowings and other funds legally available therefor, including
legally made distributions from available cash of the Company's
Subsidiaries (in each case, taking into account the retention of any amounts
necessary to satisfy the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
any applicable restrictions contained in the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
then applicable bank financing agreements by which the Company or its
Subsidiaries are bound) (each, an " _Ordinary Distribution_ "). Any
Ordinary Distribution shall be made to the Members as of the close of
business on such record date on a _pro rata_ basis (except that, for the
avoidance of doubt, (i) to the extent any Distribution Catch-Up Payment is
then due and payable, such amount shall first be paid before any Ordinary
Distribution is paid _pro rata_ and (ii) repurchases or redemptions made in
accordance with _Section 4.1(g)_ or payments made in accordance with
_Section 7.4_ or _Section 7.8_ need not be on a _pro rata_ basis, as long
as such payments are otherwise made in accordance with the terms of this LLC
Agreement), in accordance with the number of Common Units owned by each
Member as of the close of business on such record date; _provided_ _, _
_however_ , that the Managing Member shall have the obligation to make
distributions as set forth in _Sections 6.2 _and _11.3(b)(iii)_ ; and
_provided_ _,_ _further_ _,_ _that_ , notwithstanding any other provision in
this LLC Agreement to the contrary, no distributions shall be made to any
Member to the extent such distribution would render the Company insolvent.
For purposes of this _Section 6.1(a)_ and _Section 6.2(a)_, insolvent means
such distribution would violate Section 18-607(a) of the Act. Promptly
following the declaration of a distribution pursuant to this _Section 6.1_,
the Managing Member shall give notice to each Member of the amount and the
terms of the distribution and the payment date thereof. No Restricted Common
Unit shall be entitled to receive any Ordinary Distributions; _provided_ , 
_that_ , no later than five (5) Business Days following the Conversion Date
with respect to a Restricted Common Unit, for each Restricted Common Unit for
which the Vesting Event has occurred, the Company shall pay to the holder of
such Restricted Common Unit an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate per
Common Unit amount of Ordinary Distributions actually paid during
the Distribution Catch-Up Period relevant to such Restricted Common Unit (and
if any in-kind distribution was made during the Distribution Catch-Up Period,
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this LLC Agreement, shall
not include any transaction subject to _Section 4.1(i)_ hereof) to the
extent feasible (and not requiring any approval (including at PubCo) other
than that of the Managing Member in its capacity as such) identical property,
or if not feasible (or if requiring any such approval) an amount in cash
equal to the greater of the per Common Unit Fair Market Value of such in-kind
distribution (x) at the time such distribution was made and (y) at the time
such Distribution Catch-Up Payment is made) (each such distribution, a "
_Distribution Catch-Up Payment_ "). To the extent that the Conversion Date in
respect of a Restricted Common Unit occurs following the date that an
Ordinary Distribution is declared under this LLC Agreement, but on or after
the date such Ordinary Distribution is paid, such per share Ordinary
Distribution shall not be included in the Distribution Catch-Up Payment, and
such holder of such Restricted Common Unit shall be entitled to receive such
Ordinary Distribution when paid to the holders of Common Units, assuming such
holder continues to hold a Common Unit on the record date with respect to such
Ordinary Distribution.

  



  

   

 | 41| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Successors_. For purposes of determining the amount of
distributions (including Tax Distributions), each Member shall be treated as
having made the Capital Contributions made by, been allocated the net taxable
income of the Company (in accordance with the definition of Tax Amount)
allocated to, and received the distributions made to or received by its
predecessors in respect of any of such Member's Units.

  



  

(c) _Distributions In-Kind_. Except as otherwise provided in this
LLC Agreement, any distributions may be made in cash or in kind, or partly
in cash and partly in kind, as reasonably determined by the Managing Member.
In the event of any distribution of (i) property in kind or (ii) both cash
and property in kind, each Member shall be distributed its proportionate share
of any such cash so distributed and its proportionate share of any such
property so distributed in kind (based on the Fair Market Value of
such property). To the extent that the Company distributes property in-kind
to the Members, the Company shall be treated as making a distribution equal
to the Fair Market Value of such property for purposes of _Section 6.1(a)_
and such property shall be treated as if it were sold for an amount equal to
its Fair Market Value. Any resulting gain or loss shall be allocated to the
Member's Capital Accounts in accordance with _Section 5.1_ and _Section
5.2_.

  



  

Section 6.2 _Tax-Related Distributions_.

  



  

(a) Effective upon the Effective Time, prior to making any other
distributions under this LLC Agreement, on each Tax Distribution Date,
unless prohibited by applicable Law, the Managing Member shall cause the
Company, from available cash, available borrowings and other funds legally
available therefor, including legally made distributions from available cash
of the Company's Subsidiaries (taking into account any restrictions
applicable to tax distributions contained in the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' then applicable bank financing agreements by which the Company
or its Subsidiaries are bound) (collectively, " _Cash Available For Tax
Distributions_ ") to make distributions of cash (each, a " _Tax Distribution_
") to the Members holding Common Units, _pro rata_ in proportion to their
respective number of Common Units in an amount such that the Member with the
highest Tax Amount per Common Unit receives an amount equal to such Member's
Tax Amount; provided, that if the amount of Tax Distributions actually made
with respect to a quarter or a Taxable Year is greater than or less than the
Tax Distributions that would have been made under this _Section 6.2_ for such
period based on subsequent tax information and assuming no limitations based
on prohibitions under applicable Law, Cash Available For Tax Distributions, or
insolvency under this _Section 6.2_ (such limitations, the " _Liquidity
Limitations_ ") (e.g., because the estimated Tax Distributions for a Taxable
Year were greater than or less than the amount calculated based on actual
taxable income for such Taxable Year or because such Tax Distribution would
have rendered the Company insolvent (as defined in _Section 6.1(a))_, then,
on subsequent Tax Distribution Dates, starting with the next Tax Distribution
Date, and prior to any additional distributions pursuant to _Section 6.1_,
the Managing Member shall, subject to the Liquidity Limitations, cause the
Company to adjust the next Tax Distribution and subsequent Tax Distributions
downward (but not below zero) or upward (but in any event _pro rata _ in
proportion to the Members' respective number of Common Units) to reflect such
excess or shortfall; and provided _, _ further _,_ that notwithstanding any
other provision in this LLC Agreement to the contrary, (A) Tax
Distributions shall not be required to the extent any such distribution would
render the Company insolvent (as defined in Section 6.1(a)), and (B) the
Managing Member shall not be required to cause the Company to make any Tax
Distributions on any date other than a Tax Distribution Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this LLC Agreement, (a) the Managing
Member shall make, in its reasonable discretion, equitable adjustments
(downward (but not below zero) or upward) to the Members' Tax Distributions
(but in any event _pro rata_ in proportion to the Members' respective number
of Common Units) to take into account increases or decreases in the number of
Common Units held by each Member during the relevant period (including as a
result of conversion of any Restricted Common Units into Common Units in
connection with the occurrence of a Vesting Event);  _provided_ that no such
adjustments shall be made that would have a material adverse effect on the
Continuing Members without the Continuing Member Representative's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed), and (b) no Tax Distributions (or downward (but not
below zero) or upward adjustment to any Tax Distributions) shall be made
other than on a _pro rata_ basis in proportion to the Members' respective
number of Common Units.

  



  

   

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 6.3 _Distribution Upon Withdrawal_. No withdrawing Member
shall be entitled to receive any distribution or the value of such
Member's Units in the Company as a result of withdrawal from the Company
prior to the liquidation of the Company, except as provided in this LLC
Agreement.

  



  

Article VII 
 MANAGEMENT

  



  

Section 7.1 _Managing Member Rights; Member and Officer Duties_.

  



  

(a) PubCo shall be the sole Managing Member of the Company and,
pursuant to the governing documents of PubCo, the business and affairs
of PubCo shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. Except as
otherwise required by Law or provided in this LLC Agreement, (i) the Managing
Member shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Company, (ii)
the management and control of the Company's business activities and
operations shall rest exclusively with the Managing Member, and (iii)
the Members, other than the Managing Member (in its capacity as such), shall
not participate in the control, management, direction or operation of the
activities or affairs of the Company and shall have no power to act for or
bind the Company. Nothing set forth in this LLC Agreement shall reduce or
restrict the consent rights set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, or the rights set forth in the
Tax Receivable Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions thereof.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise required by the Act, no current or former
Member (including a current or former Managing Member) or any current
or former Officer shall be obligated personally for any Liability of the
Company solely by reason of being a Member or, with respect to the Managing
Member, acting as Managing Member of the Company, or, with respect to an
Officer, acting in his or her capacity as an Officer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this LLC Agreement, the failure of the
Company to observe any formalities or requirements relating to the exercise
of its powers or management of its business and affairs under this
LLC Agreement or the Act shall not be grounds for imposing personal liability
on the Managing Member for liabilities of the Company.

  



  

   

 | 43| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) In connection with the performance of its duties as the Managing
Member of the Company, the Managing Member (solely in its capacity as such)
will owe to the other Members the same fiduciary duties as it would owe to the
stockholders of a Delaware corporation if it were a member of the board of
directors of such a corporation and the other Members were stockholders of
such corporation. To the extent that, at Law or in equity, any Subsidiary of
the Company or any manager, director (or equivalent), officer, employee or
agent of any Subsidiary of the Company has duties (including fiduciary duties)
to the Company, to a Member (other than the Managing Member) or to any Person
who acquires Units, all such duties (including fiduciary duties) are hereby
limited solely to those expressly set forth in this Agreement (if any), to
the fullest extent permitted by Law. The limitation of duties
(including fiduciary duties) to the Company, each Member (other than the
Managing Member) and any Person who acquires Units set forth in the preceding
sentence is approved by the Company, each Member (other than the Managing
Member) and any Person who acquires Units.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Role of Officers_.

  



  

(a) The Managing Member may appoint, employ or otherwise contract
with any Person for the transaction of the business of the Company or the
performance of services for or on behalf of the Company, and the Managing
Member may delegate to any such Persons such authority to act on behalf of
the Company as the Managing Member may from time to time deem appropriate.

  



  

(b) The Officers of the Company as of the Effective Time are set
forth on __Exhibit C__ attached hereto.

  



  

(c) The Managing Member shall appoint a Chief Executive Officer who
will be responsible for the general and active management of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Chief Executive Officer will report to
the Managing Member and have the general powers and duties of management
usually vested in the office of chief executive officer of a corporation
organized under the DGCL, subject to the terms of this LLC Agreement and as
may be prescribed by the Managing Member, and will have such other powers and
duties as may be reasonably prescribed by the Managing Member or set forth in
this LLC Agreement. The Chief Executive Officer will have the power to
execute bonds, mortgages and other contracts requiring a seal, under the seal
of the Company, except where required or permitted by Law to be otherwise
signed and executed, and except where the signing and execution thereof is
delegated by the Managing Member to some other Officer or agent of the
Company.

  



  

(d) Except as set forth in this LLC Agreement, the Managing Member
may appoint Officers at any time, and the Officers may include, in
addition to the Chief Executive Officer, a president, one or more vice
presidents, a secretary, one or more assistant secretaries, a chief financial
officer, a general counsel, a treasurer, one or more assistant treasurers, a
chief operating officer, an executive chairman, and any other officers that
the Managing Member deems appropriate. Except as set forth in this LLC
Agreement, the Officers will serve at the pleasure of the Managing Member,
subject to all rights, if any, of such Officer under any contract of
employment. Any individual may hold any number of offices, and an Officer
may, but need not, be a Member of the Company. The Officers will exercise
such powers and perform such duties as specified in this LLC Agreement or as
reasonably determined from time to time by the Managing Member.

  



  

   

 | 44| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Subject to this LLC Agreement and to the rights, if any, of an
Officer under a contract of employment, any Officer may be removed,
either with or without cause, by the Managing Member. Any Officer may resign
at any time by giving written notice to the Managing Member. Any resignation
will take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later
time specified in that notice and, unless otherwise specified in that notice,
the acceptance of the resignation will not be necessary to make it effective.
Any resignation is without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the Company
under any contract to which the Officer is a party. A vacancy in any office
because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or any other cause
will be filled in the manner prescribed in this LLC Agreement for regular
appointments to that office.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Warranted Reliance by Officers on Others_. In
exercising their authority and performing their duties under this LLC
Agreement, the Officers shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions,
reports, or statements of the following Persons or groups unless they have
actual knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such
reliance to be unwarranted:

  



  

(a) one or more employees or other agents of the Company or its
Subsidiaries whom the Officer reasonably believes to be reliable and
competent in the matters presented; and

  



  

(b) any attorney, public accountant, or other Person as to matters
which the Officer reasonably believes to be within such Person's professional
or expert competence.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Right to Indemnification_. Each Person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise subject to or
involved in any Action, by reason of the fact that he, she or it is or was a
Member (including the Managing Member), is or was serving as the Company
Representative (including any "designated individual") or the Continuing
Member Representative or an officer, manager or director (or equivalent) or,
at the discretion of the Managing Member, any employee or agent, of
the Managing Member, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or is or was an
officer, manager or director (or equivalent) or, at the discretion of the
Managing Member, any employee or agent, of the Managing Member, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries serving at the request of the Managing Member or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as an officer, manager or director (or
equivalent) or, at the discretion of the Managing Member, any employee or
agent, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust or other entity or which relates to or arises out of the
property, business or affairs of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _Indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such Action is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, manager, officer, employee or agent or in any other
capacity while serving as an officer, manager, director, employee or agent,
shall be indemnified by the Company against all expense, Liability and loss
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such
Indemnitee in connection therewith (" _Indemnifiable Losses_ "); _provided_
_,_ _however_ , that, such Indemnitee shall not be entitled to
indemnification if such Indemnitee's conduct constituted fraud or a knowing
violation of Law; _provided_ _,_ _further_ , _however_ , except as provided
in _Section 7.4(d)_ with respect to Actions to enforce rights to
indemnification, the Company shall indemnify any such Indemnitee pursuant to
this _Section 7.4_ in connection with an Action (or part thereof
but excluding any compulsory counterclaim) initiated by such Indemnitee only
if such Action (or part thereof but excluding any compulsory counterclaim)
was authorized by the Board.

(b) _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. The right to
indemnification conferred in _Section 7.4(a)_ shall include the right to
advancement by the Company of any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees
and expenses) incurred in participating in or defending any such Action in
advance of its final disposition (an " _Advancement of Expenses_ "); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that an Advancement of Expenses incurred by an
Indemnitee shall be made pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)_ only upon
delivery to the Company of an undertaking (an " _Undertaking_ "), by or on
behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay, without interest, all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal (a " _Final Adjudication_ ") that
such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under
this _Section 7.4(b)_. An Indemnitee's right to an Advancement of
Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)_ is not subject to the
satisfaction of any standard of conduct and is not conditioned upon any prior
determination that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under _Section
7.4(a)_ with respect to the related Action or the absence of any prior
determination to the contrary.

  



  

(c) _Contract Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to the
Advancement of Expenses conferred in _Sections 7.4(a)_ and _(b)_ shall be
contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, manager, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, estate, executors, administrators
and legal representatives.

  



  

(d) _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under _Sections
7.4(a)_ or _(b)_ is not paid in full by the Company within sixty (60)
calendar days after a written claim has been received by the Company, except
in the case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case the
applicable period shall be twenty (20) calendar days, the Indemnitee may at
any time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or
in a suit brought by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses
pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any
suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification under
this LLC Agreement (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a
right to an Advancement of Expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any
suit brought by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to
the terms of an Undertaking, the Company shall be entitled to recover such
expenses, without interest, upon a Final Adjudication that, the Indemnitee
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Act.
Neither the failure of the Company (including its Managing Member or
independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in
the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the Act, nor an actual determination by the Company
(including the Managing Member or independent legal counsel) that the
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a
presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a
defense to such suit. In any suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right
to indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses under this LLC Agreement,
or brought by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses under this LLC
Agreement pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that
the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of
Expenses, shall be on the Company.

  



  

   

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Appearance as a Witness_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this _Section 7.4_, the Company shall pay or reimburse out of pocket
expenses incurred by any Person entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this
_Section 7.4_ in connection with such Person's appearance as a witness or
other participation in an Action at a time when such Person is not a named
defendant or respondent in the Action.

  



  

(f) _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and
the Advancement of Expenses conferred in this _Section 7.4_ shall not be
exclusive of any other right which a Person may have or hereafter acquire
under any Law, this LLC Agreement, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise. Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_
shall limit or otherwise affect any such other right or the Company's power
to confer any such other right.

  



  

(g) _No Duplication of Payments._ The Company shall not be liable
under this _Section 7.4_ to make any payment to an Indemnitee in respect of
any Indemnifiable Losses to the extent that the Indemnitee has otherwise
actually received payment (net of any expenses incurred in connection
therewith and any repayment by the Indemnitee made with respect thereto) under
any insurance policy or from any other source in respect of such
Indemnifiable Losses.

  



  

(h) _Maintenance of Insurance_. The Company or PubCo shall maintain
directors' and officers' insurance from a financially sound and reputable
insurer (at a minimum, in such amounts as are standard in the industry) to
protect directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries against
Indemnifiable Losses of such Indemnitee, whether or not the Company has the
authority to indemnify such Indemnitee against such Indemnifiable Losses
under this Section 7.4, in each case to the extent available under the
directors' and officers' insurance policy of PubCo.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Resignation or Termination of Managing Member_. PubCo
shall not, by any means, resign as, cease to be or be replaced as
Managing Member except in compliance with this _Section 7.5_. No termination
or replacement of PubCo as Managing Member shall be effective unless proper
provision is made, in compliance with this LLC Agreement, so that the
obligations of PubCo, its successor by merger (if applicable) and any new
Managing Member and the rights of all Members under this LLC Agreement and
applicable Law remain in full force and effect. No appointment of a Person
other than PubCo (or its successor by merger, as applicable) as
Managing Member shall be effective unless (a) the new Managing Member
executes a joinder to this LLC Agreement and agrees to be bound by the terms
and conditions in this LLC Agreement, and (b) PubCo (or its successor by
merger, as applicable) and the new Managing Member (as applicable) provide
all other Members with contractual rights, directly enforceable by such other
Members against PubCo (or its successor by merger, as applicable) and the new
Managing Member (as applicable), to cause (i) PubCo to comply with all
PubCo's obligations under this LLC Agreement (including its obligations under
_Section 4.6_) other than those that must necessarily be taken solely in its
capacity as Managing Member and (ii) the new Managing Member to comply with
all the Managing Member's obligations under this LLC Agreement.

Section 7.6 _Reclassification Events of PubCo_. If a
Reclassification Event occurs, the Managing Member or its successor as a
result of such Reclassification Event, as the case may be, shall, as and to
the extent necessary, amend this LLC Agreement in compliance with _Section
12.1_, and enter into any necessary supplementary or additional agreements,
to ensure that, following the effective date of the Reclassification Event:
(a) the exchange rights of holders of Units set forth in _Section 4.6_
provide that each Common Unit (together with the surrender and delivery of
one (1) share of Class V Common Stock) is exchangeable for the same amount and
same type of property, securities or cash (or combination thereof) that one
(1) share of Class A Common Stock becomes exchangeable for or converted into
as a result of the Reclassification Event and (b) PubCo or the successor to
PubCo as a result of such Reclassification Event, as applicable, is obligated
to deliver such property, securities or cash upon such exchange. PubCo
shall not consummate or agree to consummate any Reclassification Event unless
the successor Person as a result of such Reclassification Event, if any,
becomes obligated to comply with the obligations of PubCo (in whatever
capacity) under this LLC Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Transactions between Company and Managing Member_.
The Managing Member may cause the Company to contract and deal with the
Managing Member, or any Affiliate of the Managing Member; provided such
contracts and dealings (other than contracts and dealings between the Company
and its Subsidiaries) are on terms comparable to and competitive with those
available to the Company from others dealing at arm's length or are approved
by the Members or are otherwise approved by the Disinterested Majority.

  



  

Section 7.8 _Certain Costs and Expenses_. The Managing Member
shall not be compensated for its services as Managing Member of the Company.
The Company shall (a) pay, or cause to be paid, all costs, fees, operating
expenses and other expenses of the Company (including the costs, fees and
expenses of attorneys, accountants or other professionals and the
compensation of all personnel providing services to the Company) incurred in
pursuing and conducting, or otherwise related to, the activities of the
Company and (b) upon the good faith determination of the Managing Member,
reimburse the Managing Member for any costs, fees or expenses incurred by it
in connection with serving as the Managing Member. To the extent that the
Managing Member determines in good faith that such expenses are related to the
business and affairs of the Managing Member that are conducted through the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries (including expenses that relate to the
business and affairs of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and that also
relate to other activities of the Managing Member), the Managing Member
may cause the Company to pay or bear such expenses of the Managing Member,
including costs of securities offerings not borne directly by Members, board
of directors compensation and meeting costs, costs of periodic reports to its
stockholders, litigation costs and damages arising from litigation,
accounting and legal costs; _provided_ that the Company shall not pay or bear
any income tax obligations owed by PubCo or the cost of any Tax Benefit
Payment (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) or any amounts owed by
PubCo under the Tax Receivable Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that (a) in
the event any cost or expense incurred by the Managing Member is paid by the
Managing Member from the gross proceeds received by PubCo in connection with
an offering, issuance, exercise or conversion of Equity Securities or Debt
Securities and only the net amount of such proceeds is contributed to the
Company, such costs or expenses shall not be reimbursed under this _Section
7.8_, and (b) if PubCo is required to reimburse the Sellers for attorneys'
fees, costs and expenses pursuant to Section 10.2(n) of the Business
Combination Agreement, such attorneys' fees, costs and expenses shall not be
reimbursed under this _Section 7.8_.

Article VIII 
 ROLE OF MEMBERS

  



  

Section 8.1 _Rights or Powers_. Other than the Managing Member,
the Members, acting in their capacity as Members, shall not have any right or
power to take part in the operation, management or control of the Company or
its business and affairs, transact any business in the Company's name or to
act for or bind the Company in any way and shall not have any voting rights.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Members have all the rights and
powers set forth in this LLC Agreement and, to the extent not
inconsistent with this LLC Agreement, in the Act. Any Member, its Affiliates
and its and their employees, managers, owners, agents, directors and officers
may also be an employee or be retained as an agent of the Company. Nothing in
this _Article VIII_ shall in any way limit any Member's rights pursuant to,
and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Tax Receivable Agreement or
the Investor Rights Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.2 _Various Capacities_. The Members acknowledge and
agree that the Members or their Affiliates will from time to time act
in various capacities, including as a Member or, in the case of PubCo, the
Managing Member or the Company Representative, or, in the case of Series U,
the Continuing Member Representative.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Investment Opportunities_. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or
any analogous doctrine, shall not apply to (a) any Member (other than Members
who are directors, managers, officers or employees of the Company, PubCo or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, in which case solely acting in their
capacity as such), (b) any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Company, the Managing Member or any of their respective Subsidiaries), (c)
the Sponsor, each Continuing Member or any of its respective Affiliates
(including its respective investors and equityholders and any associated
Persons or investment funds or any of their respective portfolio companies or
investments) or (d) any of the respective officers, managers, directors,
agents, shareholders, members, and partners of any of the foregoing (each, a "
_Business Opportunities Exempt Party_ "). The Company and each of the
Members, on its own behalf and on behalf of their respective Affiliates and
equityholders, hereby renounces any interest or expectancy of the Company in,
or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities
that are from time to time presented to any Business Opportunities Exempt
Party and irrevocably waives any right to require any Business Opportunity
Exempt Party to act in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this
_Section 8.3_. No Business Opportunities Exempt Party who acquires knowledge
of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may
be an opportunity for PubCo, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, Affiliates or equityholders shall have any duty to communicate
or offer such opportunity to the Company and none of PubCo, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates or equityholders will
acquire or be entitled to any interest or participation in any such
transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter or opportunity as a result
of participation therein by a Business Opportunity Exempt Party. This
_Section 8.3_ shall not apply to, and no interest or expectancy of the
Company is renounced with respect to, any opportunity offered to any director
of PubCo if such opportunity is expressly offered or presented to,
or acquired or developed by, such Person solely in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Company. No amendment or repeal of this _Section
8.3_ shall apply to or have any effect on the Liability or alleged Liability
of any Business Opportunities Exempt Party for or with respect to any
opportunities of which any such Business Opportunities Exempt Party becomes
aware prior to such amendment or repeal. Any Person purchasing or otherwise
acquiring any interest in any Units shall be deemed to have notice of and
consented to the provisions of this _Section 8.3_. Neither the amendment or
repeal of this _Section 8.3_, nor the adoption of any provision of this LLC
Agreement inconsistent with this _Section 8.3_, shall eliminate or
reduce the effect of this _Section 8.3_ in respect of any business
opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any cause of
Action that, but for this _Section 8.3_, would accrue or arise, prior to such
amendment, repeal or adoption. No action or inaction taken by any Business
Opportunities Exempt Party in a manner consistent with this _Section
8.3_ shall be deemed to be a violation of any fiduciary or other duty owed to
any Person.

Article IX 
 TRANSFERS OF UNITS

  



  

Section 9.1 _Restrictions on Transfer_.

  



  

(a) No Member shall Transfer all or any portion of its Units,
except Transfers made in accordance with the provisions of _Section
9.1(b)_. If, notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 9.1(a)_, all or
any portion of a Member's Units are Transferred by such Member in violation
of this _Section 9.1(a)_, involuntarily, by operation of Law or otherwise,
then without limiting any other rights and remedies available to the other
Parties under this LLC Agreement, the Transferee of such Units (or
portion thereof) shall not be admitted to the Company as a Member nor be
entitled to any rights as a Member under this LLC Agreement, and the
Transferor will continue to be bound by all obligations under this LLC
Agreement. Any attempted or purported Transfer of all or a portion of a
Member's Units in violation of this _Section 9.1(a)_ shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, be null and void and of no force or effect
whatsoever. The restrictions on Transfer contained in this _Article
IX_ shall not apply to the Transfer of any capital stock of PubCo; _provided_
that (i) no shares of Class V Common Stock may be Transferred by a Member
unless an equal number of Common Units are Transferred therewith in accordance
with this LLC Agreement (including in respect of those Transfers permitted by
_Section 9.1(b))_, and (ii) no Common Units may be Transferred by a Member
holding Class V Common Stock unless an equal number of shares of Class V
Common Stock are Transferred therewith in accordance with this LLC Agreement
(including in respect of those Transfers permitted by _Section 9.1(b)_).

  



  

(b) The restrictions contained in _Section 9.1(a)_ shall not
apply to any Transfer (each, a " _Permitted Transfer_ "): (i) in connection
with an "Exchange" made in accordance with the provisions of _Section 4.6_,
(ii) by a Member to PubCo or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, (iii) by a
Member to any of such Member's Permitted Transferees, (iv) (A) by one or more
Continuing Members to the Foundation, or (B) by one or more Continuing Members
in connection with an "Exchange" made in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 4.6_ if such Continuing Member includes in the applicable Exchange
Notice its intent to promptly Transfer, taking into account any Exchange
Blackout Period, the shares of Class A Common Stock received in connection
with such Exchange to the Foundation (so long as such shares of Class
A Common Stock are promptly Transferred, taking into account any Exchange
Blackout Period, to the Foundation following consummation of such Exchange),
in the case of (A) and (B), in an amount not to exceed four percent (4%) of
the aggregate number of Common Units held by the Continuing Members
immediately after the Effective Time (the " _Foundation Transfer Amount_
", and such Transfer up to the Foundation Transaction Amount, the "
_Foundation Transfer_ "), or (v) after the Continuing Members have
Transferred the Foundation Transfer Amount to the Foundation, any subsequent
Transfer by a Continuing Member to the Foundation or an Affiliate of the Rice
Family that is a tax exempt entity; _provided_ , _however_ , if a Transfer
pursuant to _clauses (iii)_ or _(iv)_ would result in a Change of Control
(without taking into account clause (ii) of the final sentence of the
definition thereof) (including a Transfer to a Permitted Transferee or the
Foundation, or a Transfer that results in the PubCo holding more than 50% of
the outstanding Common Units), such Member must provide the Managing Member
with written notice of such Transfer at least ninety (90) calendar days prior
to the consummation of such Transfer; _provided further_ , that the
restrictions contained in this LLC Agreement will continue to apply to Units
after any Permitted Transfer of such Units, and the Transferees of the Units
so Transferred shall agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of this
LLC Agreement. In the case of a Permitted Transfer of any Common Units by a
Continuing Member, such Transferring Member shall be required to Transfer an
equal number of shares of Class V Common Stock corresponding to the number of
such Member's Common Units that were Transferred in the transaction to such
Transferee. All Permitted Transfers are subject to the additional
limitations set forth in _Section 9.1(c)_.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(c) In addition to any other restrictions on Transfer contained in
this _Article IX_, in no event may any Transfer or assignment of Units by
any Member be made (i) to any Person who lacks the legal right, power or
capacity to own Units; (ii) if such Transfer would (A) be considered to be
effected on or through an "established securities market" or a
"secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof" as such terms are
used in Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1, (B) result in the Company
having more than 100 partners, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.7704-1(h) (determined taking into account the rules of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)), (C) cause the Company to be treated as a
"publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code
or to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation pursuant to the
Code, or (D) cause the Company to have a withholding obligation under Section
1446(f) of the Code; (iii) if such Transfer would cause the Company to
become, with respect to any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of
ERISA, a "party-in-interest" (as defined in Section 3 (14) of ERISA) or a
"disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code); (iv) if
such Transfer would, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, cause any
portion of the assets of the Company to constitute assets of any employee
benefit plan pursuant to the Plan Asset Regulations or otherwise cause the
Company to be subject to regulation under ERISA; (v) if such Transfer requires
the registration of such Units issued upon any exchange of such Units,
pursuant to any applicable U.S. federal or state securities Laws; or (vi)
if such Transfer subjects the Company to regulation under the Investment
Company Act or the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. Any attempted or
purported Transfer of all or a portion of a Member's Units in violation of
this _Section 9.1(c)_ shall be null and void and of no force or effect
whatsoever.

  



  

Section 9.2 _Notice of Transfer_. Other than in connection with
Transfers made pursuant to _Section 4.6_, each Member shall, after complying
with the provisions of this LLC Agreement, but prior to any Transfer of Units,
give written notice to the Company and the other Members of such proposed
Transfer. Each such notice shall describe the manner and circumstances of the
Transfer.

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

Section 9.3 _Transferee Members_. A Transferee of Units pursuant
to this _Article IX _shall have the right to become a Member only if (a) the
requirements of this _Article IX_ are met, (b) such Transferee executes a
joinder in the form attached to this LLC Agreement as __Exhibit E__, (c)
such Transferee represents that the Transfer was made in accordance with all
applicable securities Laws, (d) the Transferor or Transferee shall have
reimbursed the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) of any Transfer or
proposed Transfer of a Member's Interest, whether or not consummated
(excluding (i) any Transfer pursuant to _Section 4.6_, and (ii) the
Foundation Transfer), and (e) if such Transferee or his or her spouse is a
resident of a community property jurisdiction, then such Transferee's spouse
shall also execute an instrument reasonably satisfactory to the Managing
Member agreeing to be bound by the terms and provisions of this LLC Agreement
to the extent of his or her community property or quasi-community property
interest, if any, in such Member's Units. Unless agreed to in writing by the
Managing Member, the admission of a Member shall not result in the release of
the Transferor from any Liability as of the date of transfer that the
Transferor may have to each remaining Member or to the Company under this LLC
Agreement or any other contract between the Managing Member, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Transferor or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand. Written notice of the admission of a Member
shall be sent promptly by the Company to each remaining Member.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Legend_. Each certificate representing a Unit, if
any, will be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the
following form:

  



  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.

  



  

THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH

of such Member's state tax apportionment information and the allocations to
such Member of taxable income, gains, losses, deductions or credits for such
Taxable Year for U.S. federal, and applicable state and local, income tax
reporting purposes at least fifteen (15) days prior to the individual or
corporate quarterly estimate payment deadline for U.S. federal income taxes
for calendar year filers (whichever is earlier). As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the end of each Taxable Year, the Company shall prepare
and deliver (or cause to be prepared and delivered) to each Person who was a
Member at any time during such Taxable Year (i) an estimated IRS Schedule K-1
(and any similar form prescribed for applicable state and local income tax
purposes) or similar documents with such information of the Company and all
relevant information regarding the Company reasonably necessary for the
Members to estimate their taxable income for such Taxable Year, and (ii) in

filing deadline (with extensions) for U.S. federal income taxes for calendar
year filers (whichever is earlier), a final IRS Schedule K-1 (and any similar
form prescribed for applicable state and local income tax purposes) and all
relevant information regarding the Company reasonably necessary for the
Members to file their tax returns on a timely basis (including extensions) for

Company all pertinent information in its possession that is reasonably
necessary to enable the Company's tax returns to be prepared and filed. Each
Member further agrees (including with respect to the Taxable Year that such
Member becomes a former Member) that such Member shall notify the Company and
consult with the Company regarding a position on its tax return in the event
such Member intends to file its tax returns in a manner that is inconsistent
with the Schedule K-1 or other statements furnished by the Company to such
Member for purposes of preparing tax returns.

and in accordance with Section 18-305 of the Act, each Member shall be
entitled to examine, either directly or through its representatives, the books
and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the principal office
of the Company or such other location as the Managing Member shall reasonably
approve during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to
such Member's interest as a Member of the Company with the information to
which such Member shall be entitled about the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries being the same information to which a stockholder of a Delaware
corporation would have with respect to such corporation; provided that, in any
event, the Managing Member has a right to keep confidential from the Members
certain information in accordance with Section 18-305 of the Act.

addition, PubCo is hereby authorized to designate or remove any other
Person selected by PubCo as the Company Representative; _provided_ that all

Taxable Year in which the Company Representative is an entity, the Company
shall appoint the "designated individual" identified by the Company
Representative and approved by the Board to act on its behalf in accordance
with the applicable Treasury Regulations or analogous provisions of state or
local Law. Each Member hereby expressly consents to such designations and
agrees to take, and that the Managing Member is authorized to take (or cause
the Company to take), such other actions as may be necessary or
advisable pursuant to Treasury Regulations or other Internal Revenue Service
or Treasury guidance or state or local Law to cause such designations or
evidence such Member's consent to such designations, including removing any
Person designated as the Company Representative (including any "designated
individual") prior to the date of this LLC Agreement.

(b) Subject to this _Section 10.4_, the Company Representative
shall have the sole authority to act on behalf of the Company in
connection with, make all relevant decisions regarding application of, and to
exercise the rights and powers provided for in the BBA Rules, including
making any elections under the BBA Rules or any decisions to settle,
compromise, challenge, litigate or otherwise alter the defense of any Action,
audit or examination before the Internal Revenue Service or any other tax
authority (each an " _Audit_ "), and to expend Company funds for professional
services and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection therewith.
Subject to the provisions of _Section 10.4(d)_, the Company Representative
will have sole discretion to determine whether the Company (either on its own
behalf or on behalf of the Members) will contest or continue to contest any
tax deficiencies assessed or proposed to be assessed by any tax authority;
_provided_ , that, except as provided in _Section 10.4(h)_, the Company
Representative shall obtain the prior written consent of the Continuing
Member Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) before (i) except as otherwise provided in
Section 9.1(j) of the Business Combination Agreement, making an election
under Section 6226(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision of state or
local Law) (a " _Push-Out Election_ ") or (ii) taking any material action
under the BBA Rules that would reasonably be expected to have a
disproportionate (compared to PubCo) and material adverse effect on the
Continuing Members, in the case of _clauses (i)_ and  _(ii)_ , for so long
as the Continuing Members and their Permitted Transferees Beneficially Own
Economic Interests (as each such term is defined in the Investor Rights
Agreement) (in the Company and PubCo, without duplication) representing more
than 50% of the Economic Interests (as defined in the Investor Rights
Agreement) held by the Continuing Members immediately after the
Effective Time (excluding for these purposes from both the percentage
Beneficially Owned immediately after the Effective Time and percentage then
Beneficially Owned at any time, the Foundation Transfer Amount, from and after
the occurrence of the Foundation Transfer).

  



  

(c) The Company Representative is authorized, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law, to cause the Company to pay any imputed
underpayment of taxes and any related interest, penalties and additions to
tax determined in accordance with Code Section 6225 that may from time to
time be required to be made under Code Section 6232 and to pay any similar
amounts arising under state, local, or foreign tax Laws (together, " _Imputed
Tax Underpayments_ "). Imputed Tax Underpayments also shall include any
imputed underpayment within the meaning of Code Section 6225 (any similar
amounts arising under state, local, or foreign tax Laws) paid (or payable) by
any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
which the Company holds (or has held) a direct or indirect interest other
than through entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax
purposes to the extent that the Company bears the economic burden of such
amounts, whether by Law or contract. To the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the Company Representative may cause the Company to allocate
the amount of any Imputed Tax Underpayment among the Members (including any
former Members) in an equitable manner, taking into account, among other
factors, the magnitude of the Imputed Tax Underpayment, the nature of the tax
items that are the subject of the adjustment giving rise to the Imputed Tax
Underpayment, the classification of the Members for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and the Persons who received (and the proportions in which they
received) the benefits of the activities that gave rise to that Imputed Tax
Underpayment. To the extent that the Company Representative elects to cause
the Company to pay an Imputed Tax Underpayment, the Company Representative
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue available procedures
under applicable Law to reduce such Imputed Tax Underpayment on account of its
Members' (or any of the Members' direct or indirect beneficial owners') tax
status, with any corresponding reduction being credited to the applicable
Member for purposes of allocating such Imputed Tax Underpayment among the
relevant Members or former Members to the extent relevant.

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company Representative
shall give prompt written notice to the Continuing Member Representative
of the commencement of any income tax Audit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Continuing Members, other than any Audit that is the subject of
Section 9.1(e) of the Business Combination Agreement to the extent that such
Audit is governed by such provisions of the Business Combination
Agreement (any such Audit that is not the subject of Section 9.1(e) of the
Business Combination Agreement, a " _Specified Audit_ "). The Company
Representative shall (i) keep the Continuing Member Representative reasonably
informed of the material developments and status of any such Specified Audit,
(ii) permit the Continuing Member Representative (or its designee) to
participate (including using separate counsel), in each case at the Continuing
Members' sole cost and expense, in any such Specified Audit to the extent
such Specified Audit would reasonably be expected to affect the Continuing
Members or their owners, and (iii) promptly notify the Continuing Member
Representative of receipt of a notice of a final partnership adjustment (or
equivalent under applicable Laws) or a final decision of a court or IRS
Appeals panel (or equivalent body under applicable Laws) with respect to such
Specified Audit. The Company Representative or the Company shall promptly
provide the Continuing Member Representative with copies of all material
correspondence between the Company Representative or the Company (as
applicable) and any Governmental Entity in connection with such Specified
Audit and shall give the Continuing Member Representative a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any material, non-ministerial
correspondence, submission (including settlement or compromise offers) or
filing in connection with any such Specified Audit. For so long as the
Continuing Members and their Permitted Transferees Beneficially Own Economic
Interests (as each such term is defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) (in
the Company and PubCo, without duplication) representing more than 50% of the
Economic Interests (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) held by the
Continuing Members immediately after the Effective Time (excluding for these
purposes from both the percentage Beneficially Owned immediately after the
Effective Time and percentage then Beneficially Owned at any time, the
Foundation Transfer Amount, from and after the occurrence of the Foundation
Transfer), the Company Representative shall not (and the Company shall not
(and shall not authorize the Company Representative to)) settle, compromise
or abandon any Specified Audit in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to have a disproportionate (compared to PubCo) and material adverse effect on
the Continuing Members without the Continuing Member Representative's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). The obligations of the Company and the Company Representative
under this _Section 10.4(d)_ with respect to any Specified Audit affecting
Continuing Members as a result of their prior ownership of Units shall
continue after the Continuing Members Transfer any or all of such Units.

  



  

(e) If the Company Representative causes the Company to make a
Push-Out Election, each Member who was a Member of the Company for
U.S. federal income tax purposes for the "reviewed year" (within the meaning
of Code Section 6225(d)(1) or similar concept under applicable state, local,
or non-U.S. Law), shall take any adjustment to income, gain, loss, deduction,
credit or otherwise (as determined in the notice of final partnership
adjustment or similar concept under applicable state, local, or non-U.S. Law)
into account as provided for in Code Section 6226(b) (or similar concept under
applicable state, local, or non-U.S. Law). The Company shall consult in good
faith with the Continuing Member Representative with respect to any material
tax election with respect to the Company that could reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on the Continuing Members.

  



  

   

56

 



    



  

(f) Promptly following the written request of the Company
Representative, the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
reimburse and indemnify the Company Representative (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any "designated individual") for all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable legal and accounting fees, claims, liabilities, losses
and damages incurred by the Company Representative in connection with the
exercise of its rights and fulfillment of its duties under this _Section
10.4_, absent willful breach, bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Company Representative or any
"designated individual". Nothing in this LLC Agreement will be construed to
restrict the Company or the Company Representative from engaging an
accounting firm or legal counsel to assist the Company Representative in
discharging its duties under this LLC Agreement.

  



  

(g) Each Member agrees to cooperate in good faith with the Company
Representative and to do or refrain from doing any or all things
reasonably requested by the Company Representative with respect to this
_Section 10.4_, including timely providing any information reasonably
necessary or advisable for the Company Representative to comply with its
obligations under Section 10.4(c), that is or are reasonably necessary or
advisable to reduce the amount of any tax, interest, penalties or similar
amounts the cost of which is (or would otherwise be) borne by the Company
(directly or indirectly) or to make any election permitted by this LLC
Agreement and the Code or other relevant tax Law unless such Member is
restricted from providing such information under any applicable Law or
contract. Each Member acknowledges that any action taken by the Company
Representative in its capacity as such may be binding upon such Members and
that such Member shall not independently act with respect to Audits affecting
the Company or its Subsidiaries (but the Continuing Member shall in all
events retain all rights provided to it under this LLC Agreement, including
but not limited to _Section 10.4(d)_). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this LLC Agreement, no provision of this LLC Agreement
shall require, or give any Person the right to require, PubCo to file any
amended tax return.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this LLC
Agreement, in the event of any conflict between Section 9.1 of the
Business Combination Agreement and this LLC Agreement, Section 9.1 of the
Business Combination Agreement shall control. The Company, the Company
Representative, the Managing Member, and the Members hereby acknowledge and
agree to the foregoing sentence and expressly agree to be bound by the terms
of Section 9.1 of the Business Combination Agreement, including that with
respect to any Audit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
taxable period ending before or including the date of the Effective Time
and for which a Push-Out Election is available, all such available elections
shall be made in accordance with applicable Laws.

  



  

(i) This  _Section 10.4_ shall be interpreted to apply to Members
and former Members and shall survive the Transfer of a Member's Units and the
termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Company and, for
this purpose to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, the Company
shall be treated as continuing in existence.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

Section 10.5 _Withholding Tax Payments and Obligations_.

  



  

(a) If the Company or any other Person in which the Company holds
an interest is required by Law to withhold or to make tax payments on behalf
of or with respect to any Member, or the Company is subjected to tax itself
(including any amounts withheld from amounts directly or indirectly payable
to the Company or to any other Person in which the Company holds an interest)
by reason of the status of any Member as such or that is specifically
attributable to a Member (including federal, state, local or foreign
withholding, personal property, unincorporated business or other taxes, the
amount of any Imputed Tax Underpayments allocated to a Member in accordance
with _Section 10.4_, and any interest, penalties, additions to tax, and
expenses related to any such amounts) (" _Tax Advances_ "), the Managing
Member may cause the Company to withhold such amounts and cause the
Company to make such tax payments as so required, and each Member hereby
authorizes the Company to do so. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Member
shall be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding Tax
Distribution or Tax Distributions and, if applicable, the proceeds of
liquidation that would otherwise have been made to such Member under this LLC
Agreement; _provided_ , that if a Tax Advance is made on behalf of a former
Member, then such former Member shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company for the entire amount of such Tax Advance. For all purposes of this
LLC Agreement, such Member shall be treated as having received the amount of
the distribution, if applicable, that is equal to the Tax Advance at the time
of such Tax Advance and (if applicable) as having paid such Tax Advance to
the relevant taxing jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
that the aggregate amount of Tax Advances for any period made on behalf of a
Member exceeds the actual Tax Distributions that would have otherwise been
made to such Member during the fifteen (15) months following such Tax
Advances, then such Member shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company for
the entire amount of such excess (which has not offset Tax Distributions
pursuant to this _Section 10.5_);  _provided_ , that such indemnification
obligation shall be the several obligation of such Member and shall not be
treated as Capital Contributions. For the avoidance of doubt, any income
taxes, penalties, additions to tax and interest payable by the Company or any
fiscally transparent entity in which the Company owns an interest shall be
treated as specifically attributable to the Members and shall be allocated
among the Members such that the burden of (or any diminution in distributable
proceeds resulting from) any such amounts is borne by those Members to whom
such amounts are specifically attributable (whether as a result of their
status, actions, inactions or otherwise, including pursuant to an allocation
made under _Section 10.4(c)_), in each case as reasonably determined by the
Company Representative.

  



  

(b) This  _Section 10.5_ shall be interpreted to apply to Members
and former Members and shall survive the Transfer of a Member's Units and the
termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Company and, for
this purpose to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, the Company
shall be treated as continuing in existence.

The Members hereby agree that the Company shall not dissolve prior to the
occurrence of a Liquidating Event. In the event of a dissolution pursuant to
_Section 11.1_, the relative economic rights of each class of Units
immediately prior to such dissolution shall be preserved to the greatest
extent practicable with respect to distributions made to Members pursuant to
_Section 11.3_ in connection with such dissolution, taking into
consideration tax and other legal constraints that may adversely affect one or
more Members and subject to compliance with applicable Laws, unless, with
respect to any class of Units, holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%)
of the Units of such class consent in writing to a treatment other than as
described above; provided that unless and until a Vesting Event has occurred
with respect to the Restricted Common Units (including a Vesting Event as a
result of such Liquidating Event), and in which case, solely with respect to

following: (a) (i) any Governmental Entity shall take possession of any
substantial part of the property of that Member or shall assume control over
the affairs or operations thereof, or (ii) a receiver or trustee shall be
appointed, or a writ, order, attachment or garnishment shall be issued with
respect to any substantial part thereof, and such possession, assumption of
control, appointment, writ or order shall continue for a period of ninety
(90) consecutive days, (b) a Member shall (i) admit in writing its inability
to pay its debts when due, or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors,
(ii) apply for or consent to the appointment of any receiver, trustee or

institute (by petition, application, answer, consent or otherwise) any
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of debts,
dissolution, liquidation, or similar proceeding under the Laws of any
jurisdiction or (c) a receiver, trustee or similar officer shall be appointed
for such Member or with respect to all or any substantial part of its property
without the application or consent of that Member, and such appointment shall
continue undischarged or unstayed for a period of ninety (90) consecutive
days or any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment
of debt, dissolution, liquidation or similar proceedings shall be instituted
(by petition, application or otherwise) against that Member and shall remain
undismissed for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days.

Section 11.3 _Procedure_.

  



  

(a) In the event of the dissolution of the Company for any reason,
the Managing Member (or in the event that there is no Managing Member or the
Managing Member is in bankruptcy, any Person selected by the majority of
Members holding Common Units) shall commence to wind up the affairs of the
Company and, subject to _Section 11.4(a)_, the Managing Member shall have
full right to determine in good faith the time, manner and terms of any sale
or sales of the property or other assets pursuant to such liquidation,
having due regard to the activity and condition of the relevant market and
general financial and economic conditions. The Members shall continue to
share Profits and Losses during the period of liquidation in the same manner
and proportion as immediately prior to the Liquidating Event. The Company
shall engage in no further business except as may be necessary to preserve the
value of the Company's assets during the period of dissolution and
liquidation.

  



  

(b) Following the allocation of all Profits and Losses as provided
in _Article V_, the net proceeds of the liquidation and any other funds of
the Company shall be distributed in the following order of priority:

  



  

(i) _First_ , to the payment and discharge of all expenses of
liquidation and discharge of all of the Company's Liabilities to
creditors (whether third parties or, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
Members), in the order of priority as provided by Law, except any obligations
to the Members in respect of their Capital Accounts or liabilities under
18-601 or 18-604 of the Act;

  



  

(ii) _Second_ , to set up such cash reserves which the Managing
Member reasonably deems necessary for contingent, conditional or unmatured
Liabilities or future payments described in this _Section 11.3(b)_ (which
reserves when they become unnecessary shall be distributed in accordance with
the provisions of _clause (iii)_ , below); and

  



  

(iii) _Third_ , the balance to the Members in accordance with
_Section 6.1(a)_.

  



  

(c) Except as provided in _Section 11.4(b)_, no Member shall have
any right to demand or receive property other than cash upon dissolution and
termination of the Company.

  



  

(d) Upon the completion of the liquidation of the Company and the
distribution of all Company funds, the Company shall terminate and
the Managing Member shall have the authority to execute and record a
certificate of cancellation of the Company, as well as any and all other
documents required to effectuate the dissolution and termination of the
Company.

  



  

(e) Prior to the distribution of the proceeds of the liquidation
and any other funds of the Company in liquidation, a proper accounting
shall be made from the date of the last previous accounting to the date of
dissolution, and a final allocation of all items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit in accordance with _Article V_ shall be made in such a
manner that, immediately before distribution of assets pursuant to _Section
11.3(b)(iii)_, the positive balance of the Capital Account of each
Member shall, to the greatest extent possible, be equal to the net amount
that would so be distributed to such Member (and any non-cash assets to be
distributed will first be written up or down to their Fair Market Value, thus
creating hypothetical gain or loss (if any), which resulting hypothetical
gain or loss shall be allocated to the Members' Capital Accounts in accordance
with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b) and other
applicable provisions of the Code and this LLC Agreement).

Capital Contributions, and (ii) no Member shall have priority over any other
Member as to the return of its Capital Contributions, distributions or
allocations, except with respect to the Distribution Catch-Up Payment as
provided in _Section 6.1(a)_. The right to a return of Capital Contributions
shall be solely to the extent set forth in this LLC Agreement.

personally liable for a deficit Capital Account balance of that Member, it
being expressly understood that the distribution of liquidation proceeds shall
be made solely from existing Company assets.

amended (including by means of merger, consolidation or other business
combination to which the Company is a party) only with the approval of the

shall be effective until written notice has been provided to the Members,

privilege granted to a Member, without such Member's prior written consent (
_provided that_  the creation or issuance of any new Unit or Equity Security
of the Company permitted pursuant to _Section 4.1_ and _Section 4.3_ and
any amendments or modifications to this LLC Agreement to the extent necessary
to reflect such creation or issuance shall not be deemed to

limited liability of any Member, or increase the Liabilities of any Member, in
each case, without the prior written consent of each such affected Member; or
(y) alter or change any rights, preferences or privileges of any Units in a
manner that is different or prejudicial relative to any other Units in the
same class of Units, without the prior written consent of each such affected
Member; or (z) modify the requirement that any action, election, decision or
determination that is required to be approved or made by the Disinterested

necessary, and solely to the extent necessary, based on the
reasonable written advice of legal counsel or a qualified tax advisor

the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code.

  



  

(c) No waiver of any provision or default under, nor consent to
any exception to, the terms of this LLC Agreement shall be effective

Section 12.5 _Rights of Members Independent_. The rights available
to the Members under this LLC Agreement and at Law shall be deemed to be
several and not dependent on each other and each such right accordingly shall
be construed as complete in itself and not by reference to any other such
right. Any one or more and/or any combination of such rights may be exercised
by a Member and/or the Company from time to time and no such exercise shall
exhaust the rights or preclude another Member from exercising any one or more
of such rights or combination thereof from time to time thereafter or

Section 12.6 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_.
The Law of the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all Actions, claims or
matters related to or arising from this LLC Agreement (including any tort or
non-contractual claims) and (b) any questions concerning the construction,
interpretation, validity and enforceability of this LLC Agreement, and the
performance of the obligations imposed by this LLC Agreement, in each case
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or
provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware. EACH PARTY TO THIS LLC AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE
BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR

ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the
Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware or if such court declines jurisdiction, then to the

out of or relating to this LLC Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of
the Action shall be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to
bring any Action arising out of or relating to this LLC Agreement in any
other courts. Nothing in this _Section 12.6_, however, shall affect the
right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law or at equity. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by Law or at equity.

the same agreement. No Party shall raise the use of a fax machine or email to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of a fax machine or email as

Section 12.10 _Representation by Counsel; Interpretation_. The
Parties acknowledge that each Party to this LLC Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this LLC Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this LLC Agreement. Accordingly, any rule
of Law, or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
claimed ambiguities in this LLC Agreement against the Party that drafted it

this LLC Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the

to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law
in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or
the remaining provisions of this LLC Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this LLC Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

provided such Member will be responsible for any violation by any of its
Affiliates, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other advisors of the
confidentiality provisions in this _Section 12.14_, (ii) each Member may
disclose Confidential Information as required in response to any summons,
subpoena or other legal requirement, provided that such Member shall
promptly notify the Managing Member in writing so the Company may seek a
protective order or appropriate remedy, (iii) each Member may disclose
Confidential Information to a proposed Transferee if such disclosure is
reasonably required in connection with any proposed Transfer of Units to such
Transferee pursuant to the terms of this LLC Agreement, and (iv) each Member

Blended Rate for a Taxable Year, if the Corporate Taxpayer solely files Tax
Returns in State 1 and State 2 in a Taxable Year, the maximum applicable
corporate income Tax rates in effect in such states in such Taxable Year are
6.5% and 5.5%, respectively, and the apportionment factors for such states in
such Taxable Year are 55% and 45%, respectively, then the Blended Rate for

there is a Realized Tax Benefit or a Realized Tax Detriment Attributable to a
TRA Party, the Corporate Taxpayer shall provide to such TRA Party a schedule
showing, in reasonable detail, the calculation of the Tax Benefit Payment
(and any Realized Tax Benefit) or the lack of a Tax Benefit Payment (and
any Realized Tax Detriment), as applicable, Attributable to such TRA Party
for such Taxable Year (a " _Tax Benefit Schedule_ ");  _provided_ that for
each of the first three (3) Taxable Years ending after the Closing Date, such
deadline shall be automatically extended from one hundred and fifty (150)
calendar days after such due date (including extensions) to one hundred and
eighty (180) calendar days after such due date (including extensions). Each
Tax Benefit Schedule shall become final as provided in Section 2.3(a) and may
be amended as provided in Section 2.3(b) (subject to the procedures set forth
in Section 2.3(b)).

(b) _Applicable Principles_. Subject to Section 3.3, the Realized
Tax Benefit (or the Realized Tax Detriment) for each Taxable Year is intended
to measure the decrease (or increase) in the actual liability for Taxes of the
Corporate Taxpayer for such Taxable Year attributable to the Tax Attributes,
determined using a "with and without" methodology. Carryovers or carrybacks
of any Tax item attributable to any of the Tax Attributes shall be considered
to be subject to the rules of the Code and the Treasury Regulations or the
appropriate provisions of United States state and local income and franchise
Tax law, as applicable, governing the use, limitation and expiration of
carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant type. If a carryover or carryback of
any Tax item includes a portion that is attributable to any Tax Attribute ("
_TRA Portion_ ") and another portion that is not (" _Non-TRA Portion_ "),
such portions shall be considered to be used in accordance with the  "with
and without" methodology so that the amount of any Non-TRA Portion is deemed
utilized, to the extent available, prior to the amount of any TRA Portion, to
the extent available (with the TRA Portion being applied on a proportionate
basis consistent with the provisions of Section 3.3). The parties agree that
(A) the payments made pursuant to this TRA Agreement in respect of (i) the
Purchase, (ii) the BSOF Purchase and Redemption and (iii) the Peak Deductions
(in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable law and other than
amounts accounted for as Imputed Interest) are intended to be treated and
shall be reported for all purposes, including Tax purposes, as additional
contingent consideration to the applicable TRA Parties for the sale
of Assigned Common Units at the Closing that has the effect of creating
additional Purchase Basis Adjustments and the payments made pursuant to this
TRA Agreement in respect of an Exchange are intended to be treated and shall
be reported for all purposes, including Tax purposes, as additional
contingent consideration to the applicable Exchanging Member for such Exchange
that has the effect of creating additional Exchange Basis Adjustments, in
each case, to the Reference Assets for the Corporate Taxpayer in the
Taxable Year of payment, (B) as a result, such additional Purchase Basis
Adjustments and Exchange Basis Adjustments shall be incorporated into the
calculation for the Taxable Year of the applicable payment and into the
calculations for subsequent Taxable Years, as appropriate, (C) the Actual Tax
Liability shall take into account the deduction of the portion of the Tax
Benefit Payment that must be accounted for as Imputed Interest under
applicable law, (D) the liability for U.S. federal income Taxes of
the Corporate Taxpayer and the amount of taxable income of the Corporate
Taxpayer for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as determined for purposes of
calculating the Actual Tax Liability and the Hypothetical Tax Liability shall
include, without duplication, such liability for Taxes and such taxable
income that is economically borne by or allocated to the Corporate Taxpayer as
a result of the provisions of Sections 10.4, 10.5(a), and 10.5(b) of the LLC
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such liability for Taxes and such
taxable income shall be included in the Hypothetical Tax Liability and the
Actual Tax Liability subject to the adjustments and assumptions set forth in
the definitions thereof and, to the extent any such amount is taken into
account on an Amended Schedule, such amount shall adjust a Tax Benefit
Payment, as applicable, in accordance with Section 2.3(b), and (E) the
provisions of _Schedule I_ shall apply as if fully set forth herein.

Section 2.3. _Procedures, Amendments_.

  



  

(a) _Procedure_. Every time the Corporate Taxpayer delivers to a
TRA Party an applicable Schedule under this TRA Agreement, including any
Amended Schedule delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b), and any Early
Termination Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall also (x) deliver to such TRA Party supporting schedules and
work papers, as determined by the Corporate Taxpayer or as reasonably
requested by such TRA Party, providing reasonable detail regarding data and
calculations that were relevant for purposes of preparing the Schedule, (y)
indicate which Advisory Firm prepared the Schedule and, upon the written
request of the TRA Party Representative, use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such Advisory Firm to prepare an Advisory Firm Letter with respect
to such Schedule, and (z) allow the TRA Party Representative and its advisors
reasonable access to the appropriate representatives at the Corporate
Taxpayer and (at the cost and expense of OpCo) at the Advisory Firm that
prepared the applicable Schedule in connection with a review of such
Schedule. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall ensure that any Tax Benefit Schedule or Early
Termination Schedule that is delivered to a TRA Party, along with any
supporting schedules and work papers, provides a reasonably detailed
presentation of the calculation of the Actual Tax Liability (the "with"
calculation) and the Hypothetical Tax Liability (the "without" calculation)
and identifies any material assumptions or operating procedures or principles
that were used for purposes of such calculations. An applicable Schedule or
amendment thereto shall become final and binding on all parties thirty (30)
calendar days from the date on which all relevant TRA Parties have been given
the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto under Section 7.1 unless the TRA
Party Representative (i) within thirty (30) calendar days after having been
given the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto, gives the
Corporate Taxpayer written notice of a material objection to such Schedule or
amendment thereto made in good faith (" _Objection Notice_ "), or (ii)
provides a written waiver of its right to give an Objection Notice within the
period described in clause (i) above, in which case such Schedule or
amendment thereto becomes binding on the date such waiver is given by the TRA
Party Representative and received by the Corporate Taxpayer. If the Corporate
Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative, for any reason, are unable to
successfully resolve the issues raised in the Objection Notice within thirty
(30) calendar days after the TRA Party Representative gives the Corporate
Taxpayer an Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative shall employ the reconciliation procedures described in
Section 7.9 (the " _Reconciliation Procedures_ "), in which case such
Schedule or Amended Schedule becomes binding in accordance with Section 7.9.
The TRA Party Representative will represent the interests of each of the TRA
Parties and shall raise and pursue, in accordance with this Section
2.3(a), any objection to a Schedule or amendment thereto timely given in
writing to the TRA Party Representative by a TRA Party.

  



  

(b) _Amended Schedule_. The applicable Schedule for any Taxable
Year may be amended from time to time by the Corporate Taxpayer (i)
in connection with a Determination affecting such Schedule, (ii) to correct
material inaccuracies in the Schedule, including those identified as a result
of the receipt of additional factual information relating to a Taxable Year
after the date the Schedule was provided to a TRA Party, (iii) to comply with
an Expert's determination under the Reconciliation Procedures, (iv)
to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit, or the Realized Tax
Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to a carryback or carryforward
of a loss or other Tax item to such Taxable Year, (v) to reflect a change in
the Realized Tax Benefit or the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year
attributable to an amended Tax Return filed for such Taxable Year or (vi)
to adjust an applicable TRA Party's Basis Schedule to take into account
payments made pursuant to this TRA Agreement (any such Schedule, an "
_Amended Schedule_ "). The Corporate Taxpayer shall provide an Amended
Schedule to each TRA Party when the Corporate Taxpayer delivers the Basis
Schedule for the following Taxable Year. In the event a Schedule is
amended after such Schedule becomes final pursuant to Section 2.3(a) or, if
applicable, Section 7.9, (A) the Amended Schedule shall not be taken into
account in calculating any Tax Benefit Payment in the Taxable Year to which
the amendment relates but instead shall be taken into account in calculating
the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit for the Taxable Year in which
the amendment actually occurs, and (B) as a result of the foregoing, any
increase of the Net Tax Benefit attributable to an Amended Schedule shall not
accrue the Interest Amount (or any other interest hereunder) until after the
due date (without extensions) for filing IRS Form 1120 (or any successor
form) of the Corporate Taxpayer with respect to Taxes for the Taxable Year in
which the amendment actually occurs.

Section 2.4. _Section 754 Election_

  



  

. In its capacity as the sole managing member of OpCo, the Corporate Taxpayer
shall ensure that, for the Taxable Year that includes the date hereof and for
each Taxable Year in which an Exchange occurs and with respect to which the
Corporate Taxpayer has obligations under this TRA Agreement, OpCo and each of
its direct and indirect Subsidiaries that is treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes will have in effect an election under Section 754
of the Code (and under any similar provisions of applicable U.S. state or
local law) for each such Taxable Year; provided that with respect to any
direct or indirect Subsidiary of OpCo that is treated as a partnership for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes for which the Corporate Taxpayer or any of
its Subsidiaries do not have the authority under the governing documents of
such Subsidiary to cause or otherwise do not have control over causing such
Subsidiary to have in effect an election under Section 754 of the Code (or
under any similar provisions of applicable U.S. state or local law), the
Corporate Taxpayer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Subsidiary to have such an election in effect.

  



  

Article III

  



  

 _TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS_

  



  

Section 3.1. _Payments_.

  



  

(a) _Payments_. Within five (5) Business Days after a Tax Benefit
Schedule delivered to a TRA Party becomes final in accordance with Section
2.3(a) or, if applicable, Section 7.9, the Corporate Taxpayer shall pay such
TRA Party for such Taxable Year the Tax Benefit Payment determined pursuant
to Section 3.1(b) that is Attributable to the relevant TRA Party. Each such
Tax Benefit Payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the bank account previously designated by such TRA Party to
the Corporate Taxpayer or as otherwise agreed by the Corporate Taxpayer and
such TRA Party. The payments provided for pursuant to the above sentence
shall be computed separately for each TRA Party. Without limiting the
Corporate Taxpayer's ability to make offsets against Tax Benefit Payments to
the extent permitted by Section 3.5, no TRA Party shall be required under any
circumstances to make a payment or return a payment to the Corporate Taxpayer
in respect of any portion of any Tax Benefit Payment previously paid by the
Corporate Taxpayer to such TRA Party (including any portion of any Early
Termination Payment).

  



  

   

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) A  " _Tax Benefit Payment_ " in respect of a TRA Party for a
Taxable Year means an amount, not less than zero, equal to the sum of (i) Net
Tax Benefit that is Attributable to such TRA Party and (ii) the Interest
Amount with respect thereto. Subject to Section 3.3, the " _Net Tax Benefit_
" for a Taxable Year shall be an amount equal to the excess, if any, of
eighty-five percent (85%) of the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit as of the
end of such Taxable Year, over the total amount of payments previously made
under the first sentence of Section 3.1(a) (excluding payments
attributable to Interest Amounts); _provided_ , that if there is no such
excess (or if a deficit exists), no TRA Party shall be required to make a
payment (or return a payment) to the Corporate Taxpayer in respect of any
portion of any Tax Benefit Payment previously paid by the Corporate Taxpayer
to such TRA Party. The " _Interest Amount_ " shall equal the interest on
the Net Tax Benefit calculated at the Agreed Rate from the due date (without
extensions) for filing IRS Form 1120 (or any successor form) of the Corporate
Taxpayer with respect to Taxes for the applicable Taxable Year until the
payment date under Section 3.1(a);  _provided_ that such interest shall not
accrue on the amount of any Net Tax Benefit after the date on which such
amount is actually paid to the applicable TRA Party, regardless of whether
such payment is made prior to the due date for such payment under Section
3.1(a) and regardless of whether the amount of any unpaid Net Tax Benefit has
yet become final in accordance with Section 2.3(a) or, if applicable, Section
7.9.

  



  

Section 3.2. _No Duplicative Payments_. It is intended that the
provisions of this TRA Agreement will not result in duplicative payment of
any amount (including interest) required under this TRA Agreement, including
that the aggregate Tax Benefit Payments (excluding payments attributable to
Interest Amounts) for any Taxable Year shall not exceed the Net Tax Benefit
for such Taxable Year. For purposes of this TRA Agreement, no Tax Benefit
Payment shall be based on estimated Tax payments, including United States
federal estimated income Tax payments. The provisions of this TRA Agreement
shall be construed in the appropriate manner to ensure such intentions are
realized.

  



  

Section 3.3. _Pro Rata Payments_. Notwithstanding anything in
Section 3.1 to the contrary, to the extent that the aggregate Realized Tax
Benefit of the Corporate Taxpayer with respect to the Tax Attributes is
limited in a particular Taxable Year because the Corporate Taxpayer does not
have sufficient taxable income, the Net Tax Benefit for the Corporate Taxpayer
shall be allocated among all parties eligible for Tax Benefit Payments under
this TRA Agreement in proportion to the amounts of Net Tax Benefit,
respectively, that would have been Attributable to each TRA Party if the
Corporate Taxpayer had sufficient taxable income so that there were no such
limitation.

  



  

Section 3.4. _Payment Ordering_. If for any reason the Corporate
Taxpayer does not fully satisfy its payment obligations to make all
Tax Benefit Payments due under this TRA Agreement in respect of a particular
Taxable Year, then the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Parties agree that (i)
Tax Benefit Payments for such Taxable Year shall be allocated to all parties
eligible for Tax Benefit Payments under this TRA Agreement in proportion to
the amounts of Net Tax Benefit, respectively, that would have been
Attributable to each TRA Party if the Corporate Taxpayer had sufficient cash
available to make such Tax Benefit Payments and (ii) no Tax Benefit Payments
shall be made in respect of any Taxable Year until all Tax Benefit Payments to
all TRA Parties in respect of all prior Taxable Years have been made in full.

  



  

Section 3.5. _Overpayments_. To the extent the Corporate Taxpayer
makes a payment to a TRA Party in respect of a particular Taxable Year under
Section 3.1(a) in an amount in excess of the amount of such payment that
should have been made to such TRA Party in respect of such Taxable
Year (taking into account Section 3.3 and Section 3.4) under the terms of
this TRA Agreement, then such TRA Party shall not receive further payments
under Section 3.1(a) until such TRA Party has foregone an amount of payments
equal to such excess.

Article IV

  



  

 _TERMINATION_

  



  

Section 4.1. _Early Termination of Agreement; Breach of
Agreement_.

  



  

(a) _Corporate Taxpayer 's Early Termination Right_. The
Corporate Taxpayer may, with the prior written consent of the TRA
Disinterested Majority, terminate this TRA Agreement (including with respect
to all amounts payable to the TRA Parties and with respect to all of the
Units held by the TRA Parties, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence)
at any time by paying to each TRA Party the Early Termination Payment in
respect of such TRA Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that this TRA Agreement
shall terminate only upon the receipt by each TRA Party of its respective
Early Termination Payment and payments described in the next sentence, if
any, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Corporate Taxpayer may withdraw any
notice to execute its termination rights under this Section 4.1(a) prior to
the time at which any Early Termination Payment has been paid. Upon
payment of the Early Termination Payment by the Corporate Taxpayer, none of
the TRA Parties or the Corporate Taxpayer shall have any further payment
obligations under this TRA Agreement, other than with respect to any (i) any
Tax Benefit Payments due and payable and that remain unpaid as of the Early
Termination Date (which Tax Benefit Payments shall not be included in the
Early Termination Payments) and as of the date of payment of the Early
Termination Payment and (ii) any Tax Benefit Payments due for the
Taxable Year ending immediately prior to or including the Early Termination
Date (except to the extent that the amounts described in this  _clause (ii)_
are included in the calculation of the Early Termination Payments (at the
option of the Corporate Taxpayer) or are included in _clause (i)_ );
_provided_ that upon payment of all amounts, to the extent applicable and
without duplication, described in this sentence, this TRA Agreement shall
terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, if an Exchange occurs after the
Corporate Taxpayer makes all of the required Early Termination Payments, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall have no obligations under this TRA Agreement with
respect to such Exchange.

  



  

(b) _Acceleration Upon Change of Control_. In the event of a
Change of Control, the TRA Party Representative shall have the option, by
written notice to the Corporate Taxpayer, to cause the acceleration of the
unpaid payment obligations as calculated in accordance with this Section
4.1(b), and such payment obligations shall be calculated as if an Early
Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of such Change of Control
and shall include, without duplication: (i) the Early Termination Payments
calculated with respect to such TRA Parties as if the Early Termination Date
is the date of such Change of Control, (ii) any Tax Benefit Payments due and
payable and that remain unpaid as of the date of such Change of Control (which
Tax Benefit Payments shall not be included in the Early Termination Payments
described in _clause (i)_ ); and (iii) any Tax Benefit Payments due for the
Taxable Year ending immediately prior to or including the date of such Change
of Control (except to the extent that the amounts described in this _clause
(iii)_ are included in the calculation of Early Termination Payments
described in _clause (i)_ (at the option of the Corporate Taxpayer) or are
included in _clause (ii)_ ); _provided_ , that the procedures of Section 4.2
(and Section 2.3, to the extent applicable) and Section 4.3 shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_ with respect to the determination of the amount payable by
the Corporate Taxpayer pursuant to this sentence and the payment
thereof, except that such amount shall not be due and payable until five (5)
Business Days after such amount has become final pursuant to Section 4.2 or,
if applicable, Section 7.9. In the event of an acceleration following a Change
of Control, any Early Termination Payment described in the preceding sentence
shall be calculated utilizing the Valuation Assumptions, substituting in each
case the terms "date of a Change of Control" for an "Early Termination Date,"
and if an Exchange occurs after the Corporate Taxpayer makes all such
required Early Termination Payments and other payments described in this
Section 4.1(b), the Corporate Taxpayer shall have no obligations under this
TRA Agreement with respect to such Exchange.

  



  

   

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) _Acceleration Upon Material Breach of TRA Agreement_. In the
event that the Corporate Taxpayer materially breaches any of its material
obligations under this TRA Agreement, whether as a result of (1) a failure to
make a payment required to be made pursuant to this TRA Agreement by the
Final Payment Date therefor (except for all or a portion of such payment that
is being validly disputed in good faith under this TRA Agreement, and then
only with respect to the amount in dispute) (a " _Payment Default_ ") or (2)
any material breach of any of its material obligations under this TRA
Agreement (other than a Payment Default) (a " _Non-Payment Default_ "), which
failure or breach, (A) in the case of a Payment Default, continues without
payment in full until the later of (y) thirty (30) calendar days following
receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of written notice of such Payment Default
from the TRA Party Representative following such Payment Default, and (z)
sixty (60) calendar days following the relevant Final Payment Date therefor,
or (B) in the case of a Non-Payment Default, continues without cure for a
period of thirty (30) calendar days following receipt by the Corporate
Taxpayer of written notice of such Non-Payment Default from the TRA Party
Representative following such Non-Payment Default (such written notice
delivered under _clause (A)_ or _(B)_ , a " _Breach Notice_ "), except in
each case to the extent otherwise set forth in the final sentence of this
Section 4.1(c) or by operation of law as a result of the rejection of this
TRA Agreement in a case commenced under bankruptcy laws (such rejection, a "
_Bankruptcy Rejection_ "), then, the unpaid payment obligations as calculated
in accordance with this Section 4.1(c) shall (I) in the case of a Payment
Default, automatically accelerate and become immediately due and payable upon
expiration of the applicable period in _clause (A)_ above (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, no such acceleration shall occur earlier than thirty (30)
calendar days following receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of a Breach Notice
with respect to such Payment Default, and receipt of a Breach Notice shall be
a condition precedent to any such acceleration), or (II) in the case of a
Non-Payment Default, accelerate and become immediately due and payable upon
written notice of acceleration from the TRA Party Representative to the
Corporate Taxpayer at any time after the expiration of the applicable period
in _clause (B)_ above (provided that in the case of any Bankruptcy
Rejection, such acceleration shall be automatic without any such written
notice, unless such acceleration is waived in writing by the TRA Party
Representative, which waiver may be retroactive). Such payment
obligations shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been
delivered on the date of such Breach Notice (or, in the case of any
Bankruptcy Rejection, on the date of such Bankruptcy Rejection) and shall
include, without duplication: (i) the Early Termination Payments calculated
with respect to such TRA Parties as if the Early Termination Date is the date
of such Breach Notice or such Bankruptcy Rejection, as applicable; (ii) any
Tax Benefit Payments due and payable and that remain unpaid as of the date of
such Breach Notice or such Bankruptcy Rejection, as applicable (which Tax
Benefit Payments shall not be included in the Early Termination Payments
described in _clause (i)_ ); and (iii) any Tax Benefit Payments due for the
Taxable Year ending immediately prior to or including the date of such Breach
Notice or such Bankruptcy Rejection, as applicable (except to the extent that
the amounts described in this _clause (iii)_ are included in the calculation
of Early Termination Payments described in _clause (i)_ (at the option of
the Corporate Taxpayer) or are included in _clause (ii)_ ); _provided_ ,
that the procedures of Section 4.2 (and Section 2.3, to the extent
applicable) and Section 4.3 shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ with respect to
the determination of the amount payable by the Corporate Taxpayer pursuant to
this sentence and the payment thereof, except that such amount shall not be
due and payable until five (5) Business Days after such amount has
become final pursuant to Section 4.2 or, if applicable, Section 7.9. In the
event of an acceleration described in this Section 4.1(c), any Early
Termination Payment described in the preceding sentence shall be calculated
utilizing the Valuation Assumptions, substituting in each case the terms
"date of a Breach Notice" or "date of a Bankruptcy Rejection," as applicable,
for an "Early Termination Date," and if an Exchange occurs after the
Corporate Taxpayer makes all such required Early Termination Payments and
other payments described in this Section 4.1(c), the Corporate Taxpayer shall
have no obligations under this TRA Agreement with respect to such Exchange.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Corporate Taxpayer
breaches this TRA Agreement and such breach is not a material breach of a
material obligation under this TRA Agreement, a TRA Party shall still be
entitled to enforce all of its rights otherwise available under this TRA
Agreement, but shall not be entitled to an acceleration of amounts payable
under this Section 4.1(c). Notwithstanding anything in this TRA Agreement to
the contrary, it shall not be a Payment Default or Non-Payment Default (and
no Breach Notice may be delivered) under this TRA Agreement if the Corporate
Taxpayer fails to make any payment due pursuant to this TRA Agreement to the
extent that the Corporate Taxpayer (w) has insufficient funds, or cannot make
such payment as a result of obligations imposed in connection with any Senior
Obligations, and cannot take commercially reasonable actions to obtain
sufficient funds, to make such payment or (x) would become insolvent as a
result of making such payment (in each case, as determined by the Board in
good faith) (clauses (w) and (x) together, the " _Liquidity Exceptions_ ");
_provided_ that the interest provisions of Section 5.2 shall apply to such
late payment (unless the Corporate Taxpayer does not have sufficient funds to
make such payment as a result of limitations imposed by, or payment
obligations under, any Senior Obligations, in which case Section 5.2 shall
apply, but the Default Rate shall be replaced by the Agreed Rate); _provided_
, _further_ , that any such payment obligation shall nonetheless accrue for
the benefit of the TRA Parties and the Corporate Taxpayer shall make such
payment at the first opportunity that the Liquidity Exceptions do not apply;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , _however_ , if the Liquidity Exceptions apply and
the Corporate Taxpayer declares or pays any dividend of cash to its
shareholders (other than the payment of any dividend to the holders of the
Class A Common Stock declared (after the Board has taken into account the
pendency of any Tax Benefit Payment) in accordance with the Corporate
Taxpayer's Dividend Policy (as defined in the LLC Agreement) prior to the
date any such Tax Benefit Payment became due and payable) while any such Tax
Benefit Payment is due and payable and remains unpaid more than sixty (60)
days following the relevant Final Payment Date, then the Liquidity Exceptions
shall no longer apply and a Breach Notice may be immediately delivered.

  



  

   

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Any Tax Attributes attributable to the Closing or to Exchanges
(or deemed Exchanges) with respect to which a payment has been made under
Section 4.1(a), Section 4.1(b) or Section 4.1(c) shall be excluded in
calculating any future Tax Benefit Payments or Early Termination Payments,
and in such case, this TRA Agreement shall have no further application to
such payments.

  



  

Section 4.2. _Early Termination Notice_. If the Corporate
Taxpayer chooses to exercise its right of early termination in
accordance with Section 4.1 above, the Corporate Taxpayer shall deliver to
each TRA Party written notice of such decision to exercise such right ("
_Early Termination Notice_ ") and a schedule (the " _Early Termination
Schedule_ ") specifying the Corporate Taxpayer's decision to exercise such
right and showing in reasonable detail the calculation of the Early
Termination Payment(s) due for each TRA Party. Each Early Termination Schedule
shall become final and binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days from
the first date on which all TRA Parties have been given such Schedule under
Section 7.1 unless the TRA Party Representative (i) within thirty (30)
calendar days after such date gives the Corporate Taxpayer written notice of
a material objection to such Schedule made in good faith (" _Material
Objection Notice_ ") or (ii) provides a written waiver of its right to give a
Material Objection Notice within the period described in clause (i) above, in
which case such Schedule becomes binding on the date such waiver is given by
the TRA Party Representative to the Corporate Taxpayer. If the Corporate
Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative, for any reason, are unable to
successfully resolve the issues raised in such Material Objection Notice
within thirty (30) calendar days after the TRA Party Representative gives the
Corporate Taxpayer the Material Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer and
the TRA Party Representative shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures in
which case such Schedule becomes binding in accordance with Section 7.9. The
TRA Party Representative will represent the interests of each of the TRA
Parties and shall raise and pursue, in accordance with this Section 4.2, any
objection to an Early Termination Schedule timely given in writing to the TRA
Party Representative by a TRA Party.

  



  

Section 4.3. _Payment upon Early Termination_.

  



  

(a) Within five (5) Business Days after an Early Termination
Effective Date, the Corporate Taxpayer shall pay to each TRA Party an
amount equal to the Early Termination Payment in respect of such TRA Party.
Such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
a bank account or accounts designated by such TRA Party or as otherwise agreed
by the Corporate Taxpayer and such TRA Party or, in the absence of such
designation or agreement, by check mailed to the last mailing address provided
by such TRA Party to the Corporate Taxpayer.

  



  

(b) " _Early Termination Payment_ " in respect of a TRA Party
shall equal the present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of
and starting from the applicable Early Termination Date, of all Tax Benefit
Payments (excluding the Interest Amount) in respect of such TRA Party that
would be required to be paid by the Corporate Taxpayer beginning from the
Early Termination Date (but which have not been previously paid as of such
date), and assuming that the Valuation Assumptions in respect of such TRA
Party are applied and that each such Tax Benefit Payment for each relevant
Taxable Year would be paid on the due date (including extensions) under
applicable law as of the Early Termination Date for filing of IRS Form 1120
(or any successor form) of the Corporate Taxpayer for each such Taxable Year.
For the avoidance of doubt, an Early Termination Payment shall be made to each
applicable TRA Party regardless of whether such TRA Party has exchanged all
of its Common Units as of the Early Termination Date.

Article V

  



  

 _SUBORDINATION AND LATE PAYMENTS_

  



  

Section 5.1.  _Subordination_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this TRA Agreement to the contrary, any Tax Benefit Payment, Early Termination
Payment or any other payment required to be made by the Corporate Taxpayer to
any TRA Party under this TRA Agreement shall rank subordinate and junior in
right of payment to any principal, interest or other amounts due and payable
in respect of any obligations in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money
(whether secured or unsecured, senior or subordinated and/or however
evidenced, including by bonds, notes or other debt instruments) of the
Corporate Taxpayer and its Subsidiaries (the "Senior Obligations") and shall
rank _pari passu_ in right of payment with all current or future unsecured
obligations of the Corporate Taxpayer that are not Senior Obligations. To the
extent that any payment under this TRA Agreement is not permitted to be made
at the time payment is due as a result of this Section 5.1 and the terms of
agreements governing Senior Obligations, such payment obligation nevertheless
shall accrue for the benefit of TRA Parties and the Corporate Taxpayer shall
make such payments at the first opportunity that such payments are permitted
to be made in accordance with the terms of the Senior Obligations.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this TRA Agreement to the contrary, to
the extent that the Corporate Taxpayer or any of its Affiliates enters
into future Tax receivable or other similar agreements ("Future TRAs"), the
Corporate Taxpayer shall ensure that the terms of any such Future TRA shall
provide that the Tax Attributes subject to this TRA Agreement shall be senior
in priority in all respects to any Tax attributes subject to any such Future
TRA for purposes of calculating the amount and timing of payments under any
such Future TRA.

  



  

Section 5.2.  _Late Payments by the Corporate Taxpayer_. Subject to the
first proviso in the last sentence of Section 4.1(c), the amount of all or
any portion of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment not made
to the TRA Parties when due under the terms of this TRA Agreement, whether as
a result of Section 5.1 or otherwise, shall be payable together with any
interest thereon, computed at the Default Rate (in place of the Agreed Rate,
if applicable) commencing from the Final Payment Date therefor accruing to
the date of actual payment; provided, that if the Corporate Taxpayer does not
have sufficient funds to make the payment as a result of limitations imposed
by, or payment obligations in respect of, any Senior Obligations, interest
shall instead be computed at the Agreed Rate; provided, further, that if any
unpaid portion of any Tax Benefit Payment is the subject of a Reconciliation
Dispute and is finally determined in such Reconciliation Dispute to be due and
payable, then interest shall accrue on such unpaid portion at the Default
Rate (in place of the Agreed Rate) from the date that is thirty (30) days
following the due date for the applicable Tax Benefit Schedule until the date
of actual payment.

Article VI

  



  

 _NO DISPUTES; CONSISTENCY; COOPERATION_

  



  

Section 6.1.  _Participation in the Corporate Taxpayer 's and OpCo's
Tax Matters_. Except as otherwise provided in this TRA Agreement, the
Business Combination Agreement or the LLC Agreement, the Corporate Taxpayer
shall have full responsibility for, and sole discretion over, all Tax matters
concerning the Corporate Taxpayer and OpCo, including the preparation, filing
or amending of any Tax Return and defending, contesting or settling any issue
pertaining to Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporate Taxpayer
shall notify the TRA Party Representative in writing of the commencement of,
and keep the TRA Party Representative reasonably informed with respect to,
the portion of any audit of the Corporate Taxpayer and OpCo or any of OpCo's
Subsidiaries by a Taxing Authority the outcome of which would reasonably be
expected to materially affect the rights and obligations of a TRA Party under
this TRA Agreement, including the Tax Benefit Payments payable to TRA Parties,
and shall provide to the TRA Party Representative reasonable opportunity (at
the cost and expense of the TRA Party Representative, on behalf of the TRA
Parties) to participate in or provide information and other input to the
Corporate Taxpayer, OpCo and its Subsidiaries and their respective advisors
concerning the conduct of any such portion of such audit; provided, however,
that the Corporate Taxpayer and OpCo (and its Subsidiaries) shall not be
required to take any action that is inconsistent with any provision of
the LLC Agreement or the Business Combination Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.2.  _Consistency_. The Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Parties
agree to report and cause their respective Affiliates to report for all
purposes, including United States federal, state and local Tax purposes and
financial reporting purposes, all Tax-related items (including the
Peak Deductions, the Basis Adjustments and each Tax Benefit Payment) in a
manner consistent with that set forth in this TRA Agreement or specified by
the Corporate Taxpayer in any Schedule, or Amended Schedule, provided by or on
behalf of the Corporate Taxpayer under this TRA Agreement that is final and
binding on the parties unless otherwise required by applicable law. The
Corporate Taxpayer shall (and shall cause OpCo and its other Subsidiaries to)
use commercially reasonable efforts (for the avoidance of doubt, taking into
account the interests and entitlements of all TRA Parties under this TRA
Agreement) to defend the Tax treatment contemplated by this TRA Agreement and
any Schedule (or Amended Schedule, as applicable) in any audit, contest or
similar proceeding with any Taxing Authority.

  



  

Section 6.3.  _Cooperation_. Each of the TRA Parties shall (a) furnish
to the Corporate Taxpayer in a timely manner such information, documents and
other materials as the Corporate Taxpayer may reasonably request for purposes
of making any determination or computation necessary or appropriate under
this TRA Agreement, preparing any Tax Return or contesting or defending any
audit, examination or controversy with any Taxing Authority, (b) make itself
available to the Corporate Taxpayer and its representatives to provide
explanations of documents and materials and such other information as the
Corporate Taxpayer or its representatives may reasonably request in
connection with any of the matters described in clause (a) above, and (c)
reasonably cooperate in connection with any such matter. OpCo shall reimburse
the TRA Parties for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred pursuant to this Section 6.3.

Section 7.2.  _Counterparts_. This TRA Agreement may be executed and
delivered in one or more counterparts and by fax, email or other electronic
transmission, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement. No party shall raise the use
of a fax machine or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of a fax machine or email as a defense to the formation or
enforceability of a contract and each party forever waives any such defense.

  



  

Section 7.3.  _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
TRA Agreement, the Business Combination Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, together with all Exhibits and Schedules to this TRA Agreement,
contain the entire agreement and understanding among the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter
in any way. Nothing in this TRA Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this TRA Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.4.  _Governing Law_. The law of the State of Delaware shall
govern (a) all claims or matters related to or arising from this TRA
Agreement (including any tort or non-contractual claims) and (b) any questions
concerning the construction, interpretation, validity and enforceability of
this TRA Agreement, and the performance of the obligations imposed by this
TRA Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice-of-law or
conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  



  

Section 7.5.  _Severability_. If any provision of this TRA Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any governmental entity,
all other provisions of this TRA Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this TRA Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

Section 7.6.  _Successors; Assignment; Amendments; Waivers_.

  



  

(a) No TRA Party may assign all or any portion of its rights or
obligations under this TRA Agreement to any Person without the prior
written approval of the TRA Disinterested Majority, except that, to the
extent that a TRA Party Transfers Units to any of such TRA Party's Permitted
Transferees in accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement, the
Transferring TRA Party shall have the option to assign, without the approval
of the Board or TRA Disinterested Majority, to the Transferee of such Units
the Transferring TRA Party's rights and obligations under this TRA Agreement
with respect to such Transferred Units. As a condition to any such
assignment, each Transferee approved by the TRA Disinterested Majority or
Permitted Transferee, as applicable, and the Corporate Taxpayer shall execute
and deliver a joinder to this TRA Agreement, in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_, agreeing to become a TRA Party for all purposes of this TRA
Agreement, except as otherwise provided in such joinder. If a TRA Party
Transfers Units in accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement but does
not assign to the Transferee of such Units its rights and obligations under
this TRA Agreement with respect to such Transferred Units, (i) such TRA Party
shall remain a TRA Party under this TRA Agreement for all purposes, including
with respect to the receipt of Tax Benefit Payments to the extent payable
hereunder (including any Tax Benefit Payments in respect of the Exchanges of
such Transferred Units by such Transferee), and (ii) the Transferee of such
Units shall not be a TRA Party. The Corporate Taxpayer may not assign any of
its rights or obligations under this TRA Agreement to any Person (other than
in connection with a Mandatory Assignment) without the prior written consent
of the TRA Party Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Any purported assignment in violation of the terms of this
Section 7.6 shall be null and void.

  



  

(b) No provision of this TRA Agreement may be amended unless such
amendment is approved in writing by each of the Corporate Taxpayer
(as determined by the TRA Disinterested Majority) and by the TRA Parties who
would be entitled to receive at least two-thirds of the total amount of the
Early Termination Payments payable to all TRA Parties under this TRA Agreement
if the Corporate Taxpayer had exercised its right of early termination on the
date of the most recent Exchange prior to such amendment (excluding, for
purposes of this sentence, all payments made to any TRA Party pursuant to
this TRA Agreement since the date of such most recent Exchange);  _provided_
, that no such amendment shall be effective if such amendment will have a
disproportionate effect on the payments one or more TRA Parties will be
entitled to receive under this TRA Agreement unless such amendment is
consented to in writing by such TRA Parties disproportionately affected. No
provision of this TRA Agreement may be waived unless such waiver is in
writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

  



  

(c) All of the terms and provisions of this TRA Agreement shall be
binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors, permitted assigns, heirs,
executors, administrators and legal representatives. The Corporate Taxpayer
shall require and cause any direct or indirect successor (whether by purchase,
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the
business or assets of the Corporate Taxpayer, by written agreement, expressly
to assume and agree to perform this TRA Agreement in the same manner and to
the same extent that the Corporate Taxpayer would be required to perform if
no such succession had taken place (any such assignment, a " _Mandatory
Assignment_ ").

Section 7.7.  _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this
TRA Agreement and the table of contents to this TRA Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this TRA Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any
Schedule or Exhibit attached hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall
have the meanings set forth in this TRA Agreement. The use of the word
"including" herein shall mean "including without limitation." The words
"hereof,"  "herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used
in this TRA Agreement, shall refer to this TRA Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this TRA Agreement. References herein to the
Preamble or to a specific Section, Subsection, Recital, Clause, Schedule or
Exhibit shall refer, respectively, to the Preamble, Sections, Subsections,
Recitals, Clauses, Schedules or Exhibits of this TRA Agreement. Terms defined
in the singular shall have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and
vice versa. References herein to any gender shall include each other gender.
The word "or" shall not be exclusive unless the context clearly requires the
selection of one (1) (but not more than one (1)) of a number of items.
References to "written" or "in writing" include in electronic form. References
herein to any Person shall include such Person's heirs, executors, personal
representatives, administrators, successors and permitted assigns; provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Section 7.7 is intended to authorize
any assignment or transfer not otherwise permitted by this TRA Agreement.
References herein to a Person in a particular capacity or capacities shall
exclude such Person in any other capacity. Any reference to "days" shall mean
calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified; provided that if
any action is required to be done or taken on a day that is not a Business
Day, then such action shall be required to be done or taken not on such day
but on the first succeeding Business Day thereafter. References herein to
any contract or agreement (including this TRA Agreement) mean such contract
or agreement as amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time
in accordance with the terms thereof. With respect to the determination of any
period of time, the word "from" means "from and including" and the words "to"
and "until" each means "to but excluding." References herein to any law shall
be deemed also to refer to such law, as amended (and any successor laws), and
all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" (or similar phrases) shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."
Except where otherwise expressly provided, all amounts in this TRA Agreement
are stated and shall be paid in United States dollars. The parties to this
TRA Agreement and their respective counsel have reviewed and negotiated this
TRA Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of such parties, and
the language used in this TRA Agreement shall be deemed to be the language
chosen by such parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Person.

  



  

Section 7.8.  _Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) EACH PARTY TO THIS TRA AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY
DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO
THIS TRA AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS TRA AGREEMENT AND/OR
THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES HEREUNDER. THE PARTIES HERETO
FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS
LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL
RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

(b) Subject to Section 7.9, each of the parties submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware or if such court declines jurisdiction, then to the Federal District
Court for the District of Delaware, in any action, suit or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this TRA Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of
such action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such
court and agrees not to bring any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this TRA Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in this Section
7.8, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by law or at equity. Each party agrees that a final
judgment in any action, suit or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and
may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law
or at equity.

  



  

Section 7.9.  _Reconciliation_. In the event that the Corporate
Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative are unable to resolve a disagreement
with respect to the calculation of amounts owed pursuant to Sections 2.3, 4.1
and 4.2 within the relevant period designated in this TRA
Agreement ("Reconciliation Dispute"), the Reconciliation Dispute shall be
submitted for determination to a nationally recognized expert in the
particular area of disagreement, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator
(the "Expert"), mutually acceptable to the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA
Party Representative. The Expert shall be a partner or principal of
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst and Young, Deloitte, KPMG, BDO USA, LLP, Grant
Thornton LLP, Alvarez and Marsal, or RSM US LLP, and unless the Corporate
Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative agree in writing otherwise, the
Expert shall not, and the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any
material relationship with any party to this TRA Agreement, any Affiliate of
any such parties, any member of the Rice Family, or any Affiliate of any such
member or any other actual or potential conflict of interest. If
the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative are unable to agree
on an Expert within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the
respondent(s) of written notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, then the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative shall cause the Expert to
be selected by the International Chamber of Commerce Centre for Expertise (the
"ICC") in accordance with the criteria set forth above in this Section 7.9.
The Expert shall resolve any matter relating to the Basis Schedule or an
amendment thereto or the Early Termination Schedule or an amendment thereto
within thirty (30) calendar days and shall resolve any matter relating to a
Tax Benefit Schedule or an amendment thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days
or, in each case, as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each
case after the matter has been submitted to the Expert for
resolution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the matter is not
resolved before any payment that is the subject of a disagreement would be
due (in the absence of such disagreement) or any Tax Return reflecting the
subject of a disagreement is due, the undisputed amount shall be paid on the
date prescribed by this TRA Agreement and such Tax Return may be filed as
prepared by the Corporate Taxpayer, subject to adjustment or amendment upon
resolution. The sum of (a) the costs and expenses relating to (i)
the engagement (and, if applicable, selection by the ICC) of such Expert and
(ii) if applicable, amending any Tax Return in connection with the decision
of such Expert and (b) the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative incurred in the conduct
of such proceeding shall be allocated between the Corporate Taxpayer, on
the one hand, and the TRA Party Representative (on behalf of the TRA
Parties), on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount
of the disputed items so submitted to the Expert that is unsuccessfully
disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the Expert) bears to
the total amount of such disputed items so submitted, and each such party
shall promptly reimburse the other party for the excess that such other party
has paid in respect of such costs and expenses over the amount it has been so
allocated. The Corporate Taxpayer may withhold payments under this TRA
Agreement to collect amounts due under the preceding sentence. Any dispute as
to whether a dispute is a Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning of this
Section 7.9 shall be decided by the Expert. The Expert shall finally
determine any Reconciliation Dispute and the determinations of the Expert
pursuant to this Section 7.9 shall be binding on the Corporate Taxpayer and
each of the TRA Parties and may be entered and enforced in any court having
jurisdiction.

  



  

   

29

 



    



  

Section 7.10.  _Withholding_. The Corporate Taxpayer shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this TRA Agreement
such amounts as the Corporate Taxpayer is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local, foreign or other Tax law; provided, however, that the Corporate
Taxpayer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify and shall
reasonably cooperate with the applicable TRA Party prior to the making of such
deductions and withholding payments to determine whether any such deductions
or withholding payments (other than any deduction or withholding required
by reason of such TRA Party's failure to comply with the last sentence of
this Section 7.10) are required under applicable law and in obtaining any
available exemption or reduction of, or otherwise minimizing to the extent
permitted by applicable law, such deduction and withholding. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority
by the Corporate Taxpayer, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this TRA Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of whom such withholding was made. Each TRA Party shall promptly provide the
Corporate Taxpayer, OpCo or other applicable withholding agent with any
applicable Tax forms and certifications (including IRS Form W-9 or the
applicable version of IRS Form W-8) reasonably requested and shall promptly
provide an update of any such Tax form or certificate previously delivered if
the same has become incorrect or has expired.

  



  

Section 7.11.  _Admission of the Corporate Taxpayer into a Consolidated
Group; Transfers of Corporate Assets_.

  



  

(a) If the Corporate Taxpayer is or becomes a member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of corporations that
files a consolidated, combined or unitary income Tax Return pursuant to
Sections 1501 et seq. of the Code or any corresponding provisions of state or
local Tax law, then: (i) the provisions of this TRA Agreement shall be applied
with respect to the group as a whole; and (ii) Tax Benefit Payments, Early
Termination Payments and other applicable items hereunder shall be computed
with reference to the consolidated, combined or unitary taxable income of the
group as a whole.

  



  

   

30

 



    



  

(b) If the Corporate Taxpayer (or any member of a group described
in Section 7.11(a)) transfers or is deemed to transfer any Unit or any
Reference Asset to a transferee that is treated as a corporation for United
States federal income Tax purposes (other than a member of a group described
in Section 7.11(a)) in a transaction in which the transferee's basis in the
property acquired is determined in whole or in part by reference to such
transferor's basis in such property, then the Corporate Taxpayer shall cause
such transferee to assume the obligation to make payments hereunder with
respect to the applicable Tax Attributes associated with any Reference Asset
or interest therein acquired (directly or indirectly) in such transfer (taking
into account any gain recognized in the transaction) in a manner consistent
with the terms of this TRA Agreement as the transferee (or one of its
Affiliates) actually realizes Tax benefits from the Tax Attributes.

  



  

(c) If OpCo transfers (or is deemed to transfer for United States
federal income Tax purposes) any Reference Asset to a transferee that is
treated as a corporation for United States federal income Tax purposes (other
than a member of a group described in Section 7.11(a)) in a transaction in
which the transferee's basis in the property acquired is determined in whole
or in part by reference to such transferor's basis in such property, OpCo
shall be treated as having disposed of the Reference Asset in a
wholly taxable transaction in which income, gain or loss is allocated to the
Corporate Taxpayer in accordance with the LLC Agreement. The consideration
deemed to be received by OpCo in a transaction contemplated in the prior
sentence shall be equal to the fair market value of the deemed transferred
asset, plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is subject, in the case
of a transfer of an encumbered asset or (ii) the amount of debt allocated to
such asset, in the case of a transfer of a partnership interest. The
transactions described in this Section 7.11(c) and Section 7.11(e) below shall
be taken into account in determining the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax
Detriment, as applicable, for such Taxable Year based on the income, gain or
loss deemed allocated to the Corporate Taxpayer using the Non-Adjusted Tax
Basis of the Referenced Assets in calculating its Hypothetical Tax Liability
for such Taxable Year and using the actual Tax basis of the Reference Assets
in calculating its Actual Tax Liability, determined using the "with and
without" methodology. Thus, for example, in determining the Hypothetical Tax
Liability of the Corporate Taxpayer, the taxable income of the Corporate
Taxpayer shall be determined by treating OpCo as having sold the applicable
Reference Asset for its fair market value, recovering any basis applicable to
such Reference Asset (using the Non-Adjusted Tax Basis), while the Actual Tax
Liability of the Corporate Taxpayer would be determined by recovering the
actual Tax basis of the Reference Asset that reflects any Basis Adjustments.

  



  

(d) If any member of a group described in Section 7.11(a) that
owns any Unit deconsolidates from the group (or the Corporate Taxpayer
deconsolidates from the group), then the Corporate Taxpayer shall cause such
member (or the parent of the consolidated group in a case where the Corporate
Taxpayer deconsolidates from the group) to assume the obligation to make
payments hereunder with respect to the applicable Tax Attributes associated
with any Reference Asset it owns (directly or indirectly) in a
manner consistent with the terms of this TRA Agreement as the member (or one
of its Affiliates) actually realizes Tax benefits.

  



  

(e) Except as otherwise set forth in Section 7.11(d), if the
Corporate Taxpayer (or any member of a group described in Section
7.11(a)) transfers (or is deemed to transfer for United States federal income
Tax purposes) any Unit in a transaction that is wholly or partially taxable,
then for purposes of calculating payments under this TRA Agreement, OpCo shall
be treated as having disposed of the portion of any Reference Asset
(determined based on a pro rata share of an undivided interest in each
Reference Asset) that is indirectly transferred by the Corporate Taxpayer or
other entity described above ( _i.e._ , taking into account the number of
Units transferred) in a wholly or partially taxable transaction, as
applicable, in which all income, gain or loss is allocated to the Corporate
Taxpayer in accordance with the LLC Agreement. The consideration deemed to be
received by OpCo shall be equal to the fair market value of the deemed
transferred asset, plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is subject,
in the case of a transfer of an encumbered asset or (ii) the amount of debt
allocated to such asset, in the case of a transfer of a partnership interest.

  



   

31

 



    



  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent
any net operating loss carryforwards that exist as of the Closing Date ("
_Pre-Closing NOLs_ ") of the Utz C Corp Entities (taking into account any
limitations on the utilization of such Pre-Closing NOLs under Section 382 of
the Code or otherwise under applicable law) become available to offset the
taxable income of the Corporate Taxpayer, except as a result of (i) a Change
of Control or (ii) any transaction in which OpCo is no longer treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the parties hereto agree
that such Pre-Closing NOLs shall be disregarded in the calculation of
Realized Tax Benefit (and the components thereof), Realized Tax Detriment (and
the components thereof) and the amount of any Tax Benefit Payment for any
taxable period in which such Pre-Closing NOLs have become available.

  



  

Section 7.12.  _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) Subject to Section 6.3, each TRA Party acknowledges and agrees
that the information of the Corporate Taxpayer is confidential and, except in
the course of performing any duties as necessary for the Corporate Taxpayer
and its Affiliates, as required by law or legal process or to enforce the
terms of this TRA Agreement, such person shall keep and retain in confidence
and not disclose to any Person any confidential matters of the Corporate
Taxpayer and its Affiliates and successors or concerning OpCo and its
Affiliates and successors learned by the TRA Party pursuant to this TRA
Agreement. This Section 7.12 shall not apply to (i) any information that has
been made publicly available by the Corporate Taxpayer or any of its
Affiliates, becomes public knowledge (except as a result of an act of the TRA
Party in violation of this TRA Agreement) or is generally known and (ii) the
disclosure of information to the extent necessary for the TRA Party to
prepare and file its Tax Returns, to respond to any inquiries regarding the
same from any Taxing Authority or to prosecute or defend any action,
proceeding or audit by any Taxing Authority with respect to such returns.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this TRA Agreement, to the extent
required by applicable law or to the extent reasonably necessary for the TRA
Party to comply with any applicable reportable transaction requirements
under applicable law, each TRA Party (and each employee, representative or
other agent of the TRA Party, as applicable) may disclose the Tax treatment
and Tax structure of the Corporate Taxpayer, OpCo and their Affiliates, and
any of their transactions, and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other Tax analyses) that are provided to the TRA Party relating to such Tax
treatment and Tax structure.

  



  

(b) If a TRA Party breaches any of the provisions of this Section
7.12, the Corporate Taxpayer shall have the right to seek to have the
provisions of this Section 7.12 specifically enforced by injunctive relief by
any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post any bond or
other security, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach shall

Own Economic Interests (in PubCo and the Operating Company, without
duplication) representing at least 75% of the Economic Interests held by such
Party(ies) immediately after the Closing (excluding for these purposes, with
respect to the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees, from both the

applicable annual or special meeting of stockholders at which directors are
to be elected, that number of individuals designated by the Seller
Representative that, if elected, will result in the Sellers having the number
of directors serving on the Board that is shown below; provided, that after
the number of Seller Directors is reduced because the percentage Beneficially

Beneficial Ownership of additional Economic Interests (in PubCo and the
Operating Company, without duplication).

the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees continue to Beneficially Own

Representative, limited partner, member or shareholder of such Party;
provided that such Party shall be responsible for any breach of this _Section
2.4_ by any such Person. No Confidential Information shall be deemed to be
provided to any Person, including any Affiliate of a Seller or Sponsor, unless

Article III 
 REGISTRATION RIGHTS

  



  

Section 3.1 _Shelf Registration._

  



  

(a) _Filing_. PubCo shall file, within 30 days of the Closing
Date, a Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration on Form S-3 (the "
_Form S-3 Shelf_"), or if PubCo is ineligible to use a Form S-3 Shelf, a
Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration on Form S-1 (the " _Form S-1
Shelf_," and together with the Form S-3 Shelf (and any Subsequent
Shelf Registration), the " _Shelf_ "), in each case, covering the resale of
all Registrable Securities (determined as of two Business Days prior to such
filing) on a delayed or continuous basis. PubCo shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Shelf to become effective under the
Securities Act as soon as practicable after such filing, but in no event
later than sixty (60) days after the initial filing thereof. The Shelf shall
provide for the resale of the Registrable Securities included therein
pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available to, and
requested by, any Special Holder. PubCo shall maintain the Shelf in
accordance with the terms of this Investor Rights Agreement, and shall prepare
and file with the SEC such amendments, including post-effective amendments,
and supplements as may be necessary to keep such Shelf continuously
effective, available for use and in compliance with the provisions of the
Securities Act until such time as there are no longer any
Registrable Securities. In the event PubCo files a Form S-1 Shelf, PubCo
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to convert the Form S-1 Shelf
(and any Subsequent Shelf Registration) to a Form S-3 Shelf as soon as
practicable after PubCo is eligible to use Form S-3.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

(b) _Subsequent Shelf Registration_. If any Shelf ceases to be
effective under the Securities Act for any reason at any time while there
are any Registrable Securities, PubCo shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to as promptly as is reasonably practicable cause such Shelf to again
become effective under the Securities Act (including obtaining the prompt
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf), and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as is reasonably
practicable amend such Shelf in a manner reasonably expected to result in the
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf or file an
additional Registration Statement as a Shelf Registration (a " _Subsequent
Shelf Registration_ ") registering the resale of all outstanding Registrable
Securities from time to time, and pursuant to any method or combination
of methods legally available to, and requested by, any Special Holder. If a
Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, PubCo shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cause such Subsequent Shelf Registration to become
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as is reasonably practicable
after the filing thereof (it being agreed that the Subsequent Shelf
Registration shall be an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement if PubCo is a
Well-Known Seasoned Issuer) and (ii) keep such Subsequent Shelf Registration
continuously effective, available for use and in compliance with the
provisions of the Securities Act until such time as there are no longer any
Registrable Securities. Any such Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be on
Form S-3 to the extent that PubCo is eligible to use such form. Otherwise,
such Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be on another appropriate form.
In the event that any Holder holds Registrable Securities that are not
registered for resale on a delayed or continuous basis, PubCo, upon request
of a Holder, shall promptly use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the resale of such Registrable Securities to be covered by either, at PubCo's
option, the Shelf (including by means of a post-effective amendment) or a
Subsequent Shelf Registration and cause the same to become effective as soon
as practicable after such filing and such Shelf or Subsequent Shelf
Registration shall be subject to the terms of this Investor Rights Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Requests for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns_. At any time and
from time to time after the Shelf has been declared effective by the SEC, the
Special Holders may request to sell all or any portion of their Registrable
Securities in an underwritten offering that is registered pursuant to the
Shelf (each, an " _Underwritten Shelf Takedown_ "); provided that PubCo shall
only be obligated to effect an Underwritten Shelf Takedown if such offering
(i) shall include securities with a total offering price (exclusive of
piggyback securities and before deduction of underwriting discounts)
reasonably expected to exceed, in the aggregate, $10.0 million (the "
_Minimum Takedown Threshold_ ") or (ii) shall be made with respect to all of
the Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holder, provided that any request
for an Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to this _clause (ii)_ made by
the Sponsor Representative as representative of the Founder Holders, shall
apply to all Registrable Securities then held by the Founder Holders. All
requests for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns shall be made by giving written
notice to PubCo, which shall specify the approximate number of Registrable
Securities proposed to be sold in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown and the
expected price range (net of underwriting discounts and commissions) of such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown, provided that each Holder agrees that the fact
that such a notice has been delivered shall constitute Confidential
Information subject to _Section 2.4_. The Special Holders that requested
such Underwritten Shelf Takedown (the " _Demanding Holders_ ") shall have
the right to select the Underwriters for such offering (which shall consist
of one or more reputable nationally or regionally recognized investment
banks), and to agree to the pricing and other terms of such offering; provided
that such selection shall be subject to the consent of PubCo, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Investor Rights Agreement, in no
event shall any Special Holder or any Transferee thereof request an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown during the Lock-Up Period. There shall be no limit
to the number of Underwritten Shelf Takedowns that may be requested by any
Special Holder, subject to the proviso in the first sentence of this _Section
3.1(c)_.

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

(d) _Reduction of Underwritten Shelf Takedowns_. If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, in good
faith, advise PubCo, the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if
any) in writing that the dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities
that the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell,
taken together with all other shares of Common Stock or other Equity
Securities that PubCo desires to sell and all other Common Stock or other
Equity Securities, if any, that have been requested to be sold in such
Underwritten Offering pursuant to separate written contractual piggyback
registration rights held by any other stockholders, exceeds the maximum
dollar amount or maximum number of Equity Securities that can be sold in the
Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price,
the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of such
offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as
applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Securities_ "), then PubCo shall include
in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: at all times (i) first, the
Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if
any) (pro rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that
each Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be included
in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown) that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing _clause
(i)_ , the Common Stock or other Equity Securities that PubCo desires to
sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
(iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , the Common Stock or
other Equity Securities of other Persons that PubCo is obligated to include in
such Underwritten Offering pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such Persons and that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

(e) _Withdrawal_. Any of the Demanding Holders initiating an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall have the right to withdraw from such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown for any or no reason whatsoever upon written
notification (a " _Withdrawal Notice_ ") to PubCo and the Underwriter or
Underwriters (if any) of such Demanding Holder's intention to withdraw from
such Underwritten Shelf Takedown, prior to the public announcement of the
Underwritten Shelf Takedown by PubCo; provided that a Special Holder may elect
to have PubCo continue an Underwritten Shelf Takedown if the Minimum Takedown
Threshold would still be satisfied or if the Underwritten Shelf Takedown
would be made with respect to all of the Registrable Securities of such
Special Holder. Following the receipt of any Withdrawal Notice, PubCo shall
promptly forward such Withdrawal Notice to any other Special Holders that had
elected to participate in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Investor Rights Agreement,
PubCo shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with the Underwritten Shelf Takedown prior to delivery of a
Withdrawal Notice under this _Section 3.1(e)_.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

(f) _Long-Form Demands_. Upon the expiration of the Lock-Up
Period and during such times as no Shelf is effective, each Special Holder may
demand that PubCo file a Registration Statement on Form S-1 for the purpose
of conducting an Underwritten Offering of any or all of such Special Holder's
Registrable Securities. PubCo shall file such Registration Statement within 30
days of receipt of such demand and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the same to be declared effective within 60 days of filing. The
provisions of  _Sections 3.1(c)_ , _(d)_ and _(e)_ shall apply to this
_Section 3.1(f)_ as if a demand under this _Section 3.1(f)_ were an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown, provided that in order to withdraw a demand
under this _Section 3.1(f)_, such withdrawal must be received by PubCo prior
to PubCo having publicly filed a Registration Statement pursuant to this
_Section 3.1(f)_.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

(a) _Piggyback Rights_. If PubCo or any Special Holder proposes
to conduct a registered offering of, or if PubCo proposes to file a
Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering
of Equity Securities of PubCo, or securities or other obligations exercisable
or exchangeable for, or convertible into Equity Securities of PubCo, for its
own account or for the account of stockholders of PubCo (or by PubCo and by
the stockholders of PubCo including an Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ hereof), other than a Registration Statement (or any
registered offering with respect thereto) (i) filed in connection with any
employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or
offering of securities solely to PubCo's existing stockholders, or (iii) for
a dividend reinvestment plan, then PubCo shall give written notice of such
proposed offering to all Special Holders as soon as practicable but not less
than four calendar days before the anticipated filing date of such
Registration Statement or, in the case of an underwritten offering pursuant
to a Shelf Registration, the launch date of such offering, which notice shall
(A) describe the amount and type of securities to be included in such
offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the
proposed managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any and if known, in such
offering, and (B) offer to all of the Special Holders the opportunity to
include in such registered offering such number of Registrable Securities as
such Special Holders may request in writing within three calendar days after
receipt of such written notice (such registered offering, a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "); provided that each Holder agrees that the fact that such a
notice has been delivered shall constitute Confidential Information subject
to _Section 2.4_. PubCo shall cause such Registrable Securities to be
included in such Piggyback Registration and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed
Underwritten Offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested by the
Special Holders pursuant to this _Section 3.2(a)_ to be included in a
Piggyback Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar
securities of PubCo included in such registered offering and to permit the
sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with
the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. The inclusion of any Special
Holder's Registrable Securities in a Piggyback Registration shall be
subject to such Special Holder's agreement to abide by the terms of _Section
3.6_ below.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

(b) _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering that is to be a
Piggyback Registration (other than an Underwritten Shelf Takedown), in good
faith, advises PubCo and the Special Holders participating in the Piggyback
Registration in writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of Common
Stock or other Equity Securities that PubCo desires to sell, taken together
with (i) the Common Stock or other Equity Securities, if any, as to which
Registration or a registered offering has been demanded pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with Persons other than the Special Holders
hereunder and (ii) the Common Stock or other Equity Securities, if any, as to
which registration has been requested pursuant to _Section 3.2_ hereof,
exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities, then:

  



  

(i) If the Registration is initiated and undertaken for PubCo's
account, PubCo shall include in any such Registration (A) first, the Common
Stock or other Equity Securities that PubCo desires to sell, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
_clause (A)_ , the Registrable Securities of Special Holders exercising their
rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_
(pro rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
Special Holder has requested be included in such Registration), which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (C) third, to
the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under
the foregoing _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , the Common Stock or other Equity
Securities, if any, as to which Registration has been requested pursuant to
written contractual piggyback registration rights of other stockholders of
PubCo, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; or

  



  

(ii) If the Registration is pursuant to a request by Persons
other than the Special Holders, then PubCo shall include in any such
Registration (A) first, the Common Stock or other Equity Securities, if any,
of such requesting Persons, other than the Special Holders, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing _clause (A)_ , the Registrable Securities of Special Holders
exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to
_Section 3.2(a)_ (pro rata based on the respective number of Registrable
Securities that each Special Holder has requested be included in such
Registration) which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has
not been reached under the foregoing _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , the Common
Stock or other Equity Securities that PubCo desires to sell, which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (D) fourth, to
the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under
the foregoing _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ and _(C)_ , the Common Stock or other
Equity Securities, if any, for the account of other Persons that PubCo is
obligated to register pursuant to separate written contractual piggyback
registration rights of such Persons, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.2(b)_, in the
event a Demanding Holder has submitted notice for a bona fide
Underwritten Shelf Takedown and all sales pursuant to such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown pursuant to _Section 3.1_ have not been effected in accordance with
the applicable plan of distribution or submitted a Withdrawal Notice prior to
such time that PubCo has given written notice of a Piggyback Registration to
all Special Holders pursuant to _Section 3.2_, then any reduction in
the number of Registrable Securities to be offered in such offering shall be
determined in accordance with _Section 3.1(d)_, instead of this _Section
3.2(b)_.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(c) _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Special Holder shall
have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for any or no
reason whatsoever upon written notification to PubCo and the Underwriter or
Underwriters (if any) of such Special Holder's intention to withdraw from
such Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement filed with the SEC with respect to such Piggyback Registration or,
in the case of a Piggyback Registration pursuant to a Shelf Registration, the
filing of the applicable "red herring" prospectus or prospectus supplement
with respect to such Piggyback Registration used for marketing such
transaction. PubCo (whether on its own good faith determination or as the
result of a request for withdrawal by Persons pursuant to separate written
contractual obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement filed with the
SEC in connection with a Piggyback Registration (which, in no circumstance,
shall include the Shelf) at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Investor Rights Agreement, PubCo shall be responsible for the
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration
prior to its withdrawal under this _Section 3.2(c)_.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Restriction on Transfer_. In connection with any
Underwritten Offering of Equity Securities of PubCo, each Holder that holds
more than 2.5% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock (after giving
effect to the exchange of all outstanding Utz Units), agrees that it
shall not Transfer any Common Stock (other than those included in such
offering pursuant to this Investor Rights Agreement), without the prior
written consent of PubCo, during the seven days prior to and the 90-day period
beginning on the date of pricing of such offering, except in the event the
Underwriter managing the offering otherwise agrees by written consent, and
further agrees to execute a customary lock-up agreement in favor of the
Underwriters to such effect (in each case on substantially the same terms and
conditions as all such Holders). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder shall
not be subject to this _Section 3.3_ with respect to an Underwritten
Offering unless each Holder that holds at least 2.5% of the issued and
outstanding Common Stock (after giving effect to the exchange of all
outstanding Utz Units) and each of PubCo's directors and executive officers
have executed a lock-up on terms at least as restrictive with respect to such
Underwritten Offering as requested of the Holders.

  



  

Section 3.4 _General Procedures_. In connection with effecting
any Registration and/or Shelf Takedown, subject to applicable Law and any
regulations promulgated by any securities exchange on which PubCo's Equity
Securities are then listed, each as interpreted by PubCo with the advice of
its counsel, PubCo shall use its reasonable best efforts (except as set forth
in _clause (d)_ below) to effect such Registration to permit the sale of the
Registrable Securities included in such Registration in accordance with
the intended plan of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto PubCo shall,
as expeditiously as possible:

  



  

(a) prepare and file with the SEC as soon as practicable a
Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective and remain effective until all Registrable Securities covered by
such Registration Statement have been sold;

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-
effective amendments to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to
the Prospectus, as may be reasonably requested by any Special Holder or as
may be required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the
registration form used by PubCo or by the Securities Act or rules and
regulations thereunder to keep the Registration Statement effective until all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement are sold in
accordance with the intended plan of distribution set forth in such
Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus;

  



  

(c) prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the
Underwriters, if any, and the Special Holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration, and such Special Holders' legal counsel, if
any, copies of such Registration Statement as proposed to be filed, each
amendment and supplement to such Registration Statement (in each case
including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein), the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including
each preliminary Prospectus), and such other documents as the Underwriters or
the Special Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration
or the legal counsel for any such Special Holders, if any, may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
owned by such Special Holders;

  



  

(d) prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use
its best efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement under such securities or
"blue sky" Laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as the Holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement (in light of
their intended plan of distribution) may request (or provide evidence
satisfactory to such Holders that the Registrable Securities are exempt from
such registration or qualification) and (ii) take such action necessary to
cause such Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be
registered with or approved by such other Governmental Entities as may be
necessary by virtue of the business and operations of PubCo and do any and
all other acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the
Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; provided, however, that PubCo shall not be required to qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify or take any action to which it would be subject to general
service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then
otherwise so subject;

  



  

(e) cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each
securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar
securities issued by PubCo are then listed;

  



  

(f) provide a transfer agent or warrant agent, as applicable, and
registrar for all such Registrable Securities no later than the
effective date of such Registration Statement;

  



  

(g) advise each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a
Registration Statement, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain
knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC suspending
the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and promptly use its reasonable
best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its
withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(h) at least three calendar days prior to the filing of any
Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to
such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document that is to be
incorporated by reference into such Registration Statement or Prospectus
furnish a draft thereof to each Special Holder of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement, or its counsel, if any (excluding
any exhibits thereto and any filing made under the Exchange Act that is to be
incorporated by reference therein);

  



  

(i) notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to
such Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the
Prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as then in
effect, includes a Misstatement, and then to correct such Misstatement as set
forth in _Section 3.7_ hereof;

  



  

(j) permit Representatives of the Special Holders, the
Underwriters, if any, and any attorney, consultant or accountant retained by
such Special Holders or Underwriter to participate, at each such Person's own
expense except to the extent such expenses constitute Registration Expenses,
in the preparation of the Registration Statement, and cause PubCo's officers,
directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such Representative, Underwriter, attorney, consultant or accountant in
connection with the Registration; provided, however, that such Persons agree
to confidentiality arrangements reasonably satisfactory to PubCo, prior to
the release or disclosure of any such information;

  



  

(k) obtain a "cold comfort" letter, and a bring-down thereof, from
PubCo's independent registered public accountants in the event of an
Underwritten Offering which the participating Special Holders may rely on, in
customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by
"cold comfort" letters as the managing Underwriter may reasonably
request, and reasonably satisfactory to the participating Special Holders;

  



  

(l) on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale
pursuant to such Registration, obtain an opinion and negative
assurances letter, dated such date, of counsel representing PubCo for the
purposes of such Registration, addressed to the Special Holders, the
placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the Underwriters, if any, covering
such legal matters with respect to the Registration in respect of which such
opinion is being given as the Special Holders, placement agent, sales agent,
or Underwriter may reasonably request and as are customarily included in such
opinions and negative assurance letters, and reasonably satisfactory to the
participating Special Holders;

  



  

(m) in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and
perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and
customary form, with the managing Underwriter of such offering;

  



  

(n) make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least 12 months
beginning within three months after the effective date of the Registration
Statement which satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities
Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by
the SEC);

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

(o) if an Underwritten Offering involves Registrable Securities
with a total offering price (including piggyback securities and
before deduction of underwriting discounts) reasonably expected to exceed, in
the aggregate, $35.0 million, use its reasonable best efforts to make
available senior executives of PubCo to participate in customary "road show"
presentations that may be reasonably requested by the Underwriter in such
Underwritten Offering; and

  



  

(p) otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take
such customary actions as may reasonably be requested, by the Special
Holders, in connection with such Registration.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Registration Expenses_. The Registration Expenses
of all Registrations shall be borne by PubCo. It is acknowledged by the
Holders that the Holders selling any Registrable Securities in an offering
shall bear all incremental selling expenses relating to the sale of
Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters' commissions and discounts,
brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing costs and, other than as set forth in
the definition of " _Registration Expenses_ ," all reasonable fees and
expenses of any legal counsel representing such Holders, in each case pro
rata based on the number of Registrable Securities that such Holders have sold
in such Registration.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Requirements for Participating in Underwritten
Offerings_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Investor Rights Agreement, if any Holder does not provide PubCo with its
requested Holder Information, PubCo may exclude such Holder's Registrable
Securities from the applicable Registration Statement or Prospectus if PubCo
determines, based on the advice of counsel, that such information is
necessary to effect the registration and such Holder continues thereafter to
withhold such information. No Person may participate in any Underwritten
Offering of Equity Securities of PubCo pursuant to a Registration under this
Investor Rights Agreement unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Person's
Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting and
other arrangements approved by PubCo in the case of an Underwritten Offering
initiated by PubCo, and approved by the Demanding Holders in the case of an
Underwritten Offering initiated by the Demanding Holders and (b) completes and
executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-
up agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary documents as may be
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
Subject to the minimum thresholds set forth in _Section 3.1(c)_ and 
_3.4(o)_ of this Investor Rights Agreement, the exclusion of a Holder's
Registrable Securities as a result of this  _Section 3.6_ shall not affect
the registration of the other Registrable Securities to be included in such
Registration.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon
receipt of written notice from PubCo that a Registration Statement or
Prospectus contains a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith
discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities until it has received
copies of a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement
(and PubCo hereby covenants to prepare and file such supplement or amendment
as soon as practicable after giving such notice), or until it is advised in
writing by PubCo that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the
filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in
respect of any Registration at any time would require PubCo to make an
Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration
Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to PubCo for reasons
beyond PubCo's control, PubCo may, upon giving prompt written notice of such
action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or
suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the shortest period of time,
but in no event more than 90 days in any 12-month period, determined in good
faith by PubCo to be necessary for such purpose. In the event PubCo exercises
its rights under the preceding sentence, the Holders agree to
suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice referred to above,
their use of the Prospectus relating to such Registration in connection with
any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. PubCo shall immediately
notify the Holders of the expiration of any period during which it exercised
its rights under this _Section 3.7_.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

Section 3.8 _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall
own Registrable Securities, PubCo, at all times while it shall be a reporting
company under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain
extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period)
all reports required to be filed by PubCo after the Effective Date pursuant to
Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish the
Holders with true and complete copies of all such filings; provided that any
documents publicly filed or furnished with the SEC pursuant to the Electronic
Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System shall be deemed to have been
furnished to the Holders pursuant to this _Section 3.8_.

  



  

Section 3.9 _Other Obligations_. In connection with a Transfer
of Registrable Securities exempt from Section 5 of the Securities Act or
through any broker-dealer transactions described in the plan of distribution
set forth within the Prospectus and pursuant to the Registration Statement of
which such Prospectus forms a part, PubCo shall, subject to applicable Law, as
interpreted by PubCo with the advice of counsel, and the receipt of any
customary documentation required from the applicable Holders in connection
therewith, (a) promptly instruct its transfer agent to remove any restrictive
legends applicable to the Registrable Securities being Transferred and (b)
cause its legal counsel to deliver the necessary legal opinions, if any, to
the transfer agent in connection with the instruction under  _clause (a)_. In
addition, PubCo shall cooperate reasonably with, and take such customary
actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in connection with the
aforementioned Transfers; provided, however, that PubCo shall have no
obligation to participate in any "road shows" or assist with the preparation
of any offering memoranda or related documentation with respect to any
Transfer of Registrable Securities in any transaction that does not constitute
an Underwritten Offering.

  



  

Section 3.10 _Indemnification and Contribution_.

  



  

(a) PubCo agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by Law,
each Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers, managers, directors
and Representatives and each Person who controls such Holder (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees) caused by, resulting
from, arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii)
any violation or alleged violation by PubCo of the Securities Act or any
other similar federal or state securities Laws, except in each case insofar as
the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing
to PubCo by such Holder expressly for use therein. PubCo shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing sentence with respect to the indemnification of each
Holder.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a
Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall
furnish to PubCo in writing such information and affidavits as PubCo
reasonably requests for use in connection with any such
Registration Statement or Prospectus (the " _Holder Information_ ") and, to
the extent permitted by Law, such Holder shall indemnify PubCo, its directors
and officers and each Person who controls PubCo (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement of
material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such
untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so
furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use therein; provided,
however, that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and
several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the liability of
each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and
limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. The Holders
of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers,
directors and each Person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing
sentence with respect to indemnification of PubCo.

  



  

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification under this _Section
3.10_ shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any
claim with respect to which such Person seeks indemnification (provided that
the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any Person's right to
indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not materially
prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified
party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such
indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim,
permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). An indemnifying
party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a
claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one
counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect
to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a
conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other
of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. No indemnifying party
shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all
respects by the payment of money (and such money is so paid by the
indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which
settlement does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

(d) The indemnification provided under this Investor Rights
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer,
manager, director, Representative or controlling Person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the Transfer of securities.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(e) If the indemnification provided in this _Section 3.10_ from
the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; provided, however, that the
liability of any Holder under this _Section 3.10(e)_ shall be limited to the
amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving
rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a Party as a result of
the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 3.10(a)_ , _3.10(b)_ and
_3.10(c)_ , any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred
by such Party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The Parties
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to
this _Section 3.10(e)_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by
any other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in this _Section 3.10(e)_. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this _Section
3.10(e)_ from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

  



  

Section 3.11 _Other Registration Rights_. Other than the
registration rights set forth in the Original RRA, PubCo represents and
warrants that no Person, other than a Holder of Registrable Securities
pursuant to this Investor Rights Agreement, has any right to require PubCo to
register any securities of PubCo for sale or to include such securities of
PubCo in any Registration Statement filed by PubCo for the sale of securities
for its own account or for the account of any other Person. Further, each of
PubCo, the Sponsor and the Sponsor Representative represents and warrants
that this Investor Rights Agreement supersedes any other registration
rights agreement or agreement.

  



  

Section 3.12 _Rule 144_. With a view to making available to the
Holders the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, PubCo
covenants that it will (a) make available at all times information necessary
to comply with Rule 144, if such Rule is available with respect to resales of
the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act, and (b) take such further
action as the Holders may reasonably request, all to the extent required from
time to time to enable them to sell Registrable Securities without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (if available with
respect to resales of the Registrable Securities), as such rule may be amended

in writing by PubCo, to represent to PubCo the total number of Registrable

the Sponsor distributes all of its Registrable Securities to its members, the
Founder Holders shall be treated as the Sponsor under this Investor Rights

be entitled to rights in excess of those conferred on the Sponsor, as if the
Sponsor remained a single entity party to this Investor Rights Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Sellers distribute all of their
Registrable Securities to their members, such distributees shall be
treated as the Sellers under this Investor Rights Agreement; provided that

privileges, duties and obligations under this Investor Rights Agreement shall
continue with respect to the Common Stock as so changed.

28

 



    

  



  

(b) During the Lock-Up Period, any purported Transfer of Lock-Up
Shares other than in accordance with this Investor Rights Agreement shall be
null and void, and PubCo shall refuse to recognize any such Transfer for any
purpose.

  



  

(c) The Special Holders and the CCH Independent Directors
acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Investor Rights Agreement, the Equity Securities in the
Operating Company (including Retained Company Units and Retained Restricted
Company Units), Restricted Sponsor Shares, shares of Class V Common Stock and
shares of Class A Common Stock, in each case, Beneficially Owned by such

of such Person's Permitted Transferees, upon written notice to PubCo and, in
the case of such a Transfer by the Sponsor (including a Founder Holder) or
any CCH Independent Director, the Seller Representative, and in the case of
such a Transfer by a Seller or its Permitted Transferees, the Sponsor
Representative or (ii) (a) a charitable organization, upon written notice to
PubCo and, in the case of such a Transfer by the Sponsor (including a Founder
Holder) or any CCH Independent Director, the Seller Representative, and in
the case of such a Transfer by a Seller or its Permitted Transferees, the
Sponsor Representative; (b) in the case of an individual, by virtue of laws
of descent and distribution upon death of the individual; (c) in the case of
an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order; or (d)
pursuant to any liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar
transaction which results in all of PubCo's stockholders having the right to
exchange their shares of Common Stock for cash, securities or other property
subsequent to the Business Combination; provided, that in connection with any
Transfer of such Lock-Up Shares pursuant to _clause (ii)_ above, (x) the
restrictions and obligations contained in _Section 4.1_ and this _Section
4.2_ will continue to apply to such Lock-Up Shares after any Transfer of such
Lock-Up Shares, and (y) the Transferee of such Lock-Up Shares shall have no
rights under this Investor Rights Agreement, unless, for the avoidance of
doubt, such Transferee is a Permitted Transferee in accordance with this
Investor Rights Agreement. Any Transferee of Lock-Up Shares who is a
Permitted Transferee of the Transferor pursuant to this _Section 4.2_
shall be required, at the time of and as a condition to such Transfer, to
become a party to this Investor Rights Agreement, the Standstill Agreement
(as defined below) and, if applicable, the Sponsor Side Letter by executing

applicable, the Sponsor Side Letter.

rights or remedies under this Investor Rights Agreement or otherwise create
any third party beneficiary hereto.

Section 5.7 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_.
The Law of the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all Actions, claims or
matters related to or arising from this Investor Rights Agreement (including
any tort or non-contractual claims) and (b) any questions concerning the
construction, interpretation, validity and enforceability of this Investor
Rights Agreement, and the performance of the obligations imposed by this
Investor Rights Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice of
law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. EACH PARTY TO THIS INVESTOR
RIGHTS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES
(WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED
WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE
RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES UNDER THIS INVESTOR
RIGHTS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS
REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH SUCH PARTY'S LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY
AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES SUCH PARTY'S JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION
WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of first, the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or if such
court declines jurisdiction, then to the Federal District Court for the
District of Delaware, in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Investor Rights Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action
shall be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any
Action arising out of or relating to this Investor Rights Agreement in any
other courts. Nothing in this _Section 5.7_, however, shall affect the right
of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law or
at equity. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action so brought
shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law or at equity.

  



   

33

 



    

  



  

Section 5.8 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby agrees and
acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damages that
would be suffered if the Parties fail to comply with any of the obligations
imposed on them by this Investor Rights Agreement and that, in the event of
any such failure, an aggrieved Party will be irreparably damaged and will not
have an adequate remedy at Law. Any such Party shall, therefore, be entitled
(in addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled at Law or
in equity) to seek injunctive relief, including specific performance, to
enforce such obligations, without the posting of any bond, and if any Action
should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Investor
Rights Agreement, none of the Parties shall raise the defense that there is
an adequate remedy at Law.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Subsequent Acquisition of Shares_. Any Equity
Securities of PubCo or Operating Company acquired subsequent to the Effective
Date by a Holder shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Investor Rights Agreement and such shares shall be considered to be "
_Registrable Securities_ " as such term is used in this Investor Rights
Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Sponsor Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Sponsor represents and warrants to the Sellers that as of
the Effective Date the Founder Holders Beneficially Own in the
aggregate 9,555,671.61 shares of Class A Common Stock resulting from the
automatic conversion of the Class B Ordinary Shares of PubCo Beneficially
Owned by the Founder Holders prior to the Effective Date and 1,935,328.38
shares of Restricted Sponsor Shares that are owned by the Sponsor.

  



  

(b) The Sponsor Representative shall give written notice to PubCo
and the Sellers promptly following the dissolution of the Sponsor,
which notice shall include (i) the effective date of such dissolution, and
(ii) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Restricted Sponsor
Shares referred to in _Section 5.10(a)_ that will be distributed to each
Founder Holder as a result of such dissolution. Upon dissolution of the
Sponsor, all obligations of the Sponsor under this Investor Rights
Agreement will thereafter automatically become obligations of the Founder
Holders, without any further action or execution of any agreements or
documents by any Founder Holder, and any and all notices to be delivered to
the Sponsor under this Investor Rights Agreement after the dissolution of the
Sponsor shall be delivered solely to the Sponsor Representative.

  



  

   

34

 



    



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has duly executed this Investor
Rights Agreement as of the Effective Date.

event with respect to any Award (or portion of any Award) that provides for

interruption of Continuous Service. The Committee or its delegate, in its sole
discretion, may determine whether Continuous Service shall be considered
interrupted in the case of any leave of absence approved by that party,

absence. The Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, may

Plan or any Award granted under the Plan, and against all amounts paid by the

settlement has been approved by the Company, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) or paid by the Committee in satisfaction of a judgment
in any such action, suit or proceeding, except in relation to matters as to
which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such
Committee did not act in good faith and in a manner which such Person
reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Company, or in the
case of a criminal proceeding, had no reason to believe that the conduct
complained of was unlawful; _provided, however_ , that within 60 days after

is canceled, forfeited, cash-settled or terminated without issuance of the
full number of shares of Common Stock to which the Award related will again be

"Substitute Awards"). Substitute Awards shall not be counted against the
Total Share Reserve; _provided, that_ , Substitute Awards issued in
connection with the assumption of, or in substitution for,
outstanding options intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options shall be
counted against the ISO limit. Subject to applicable stock
exchange requirements, converted awards of Restricted Stock Units under the
LTIP and available shares under a stockholder-approved plan of an entity
directly or indirectly acquired by the Company or with which the Company
combines (as appropriately adjusted to reflect such acquisition or
transaction) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not count toward
the Total Share Reserve.

  



  

4.7 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the
contrary, with respect to any Award that provides for or includes a right to
dividends or dividend equivalents, if dividends are declared during the
period that an equity Award is outstanding, such dividends (or
dividend equivalents) shall either (i) not be paid or credited with respect
to such Award or (ii) be accumulated but remain subject to vesting
requirement(s) to the same extent as the applicable Award and shall only be
paid at the time or times such vesting requirement(s) are satisfied. In no
event shall dividends or dividend equivalents be paid with respect to Options
or Stock Appreciation Rights.

  



  

5. _Eligibility_.

  



  

5.1 _Eligibility for Specific Awards_. Incentive Stock Options
may be granted only to Employees. Awards other than Incentive Stock Options
may be granted to Employees, Consultants and Independent Directors and those
individuals whom the Committee determines are reasonably expected to become
Employees, Consultants and Independent Directors following the Grant Date.

  



  

5.2 _Ten Percent Stockholders_. A Ten Percent Stockholder shall
not be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless the Option Exercise Price is
at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Grant Date
and the Option is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the
Grant Date.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

6. _Option Provisions_. Each Option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. Each Option so granted shall be subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5 and this Section 6, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. All Options shall be separately designated Incentive Stock Options or Non-qualified Stock Options at the time of grant, and, if certificates are issued, a separate certificate or certificates will be issued for shares of Common Stock purchased on exercise of each type of Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no liability to any Participant or any other Person if an Option designated as an Incentive Stock Option fails to qualify as such at any time or if an Option is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the terms of such Option do not satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The provisions of separate Options need not be identical, but each Option shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:

  



  

6.1 _Term_. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.2 regarding
Ten Percent Stockholders, no Incentive Stock Option shall be
exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the Grant Date. The term of
a Non-qualified Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be determined by
the Committee; _provided, however_ , no Non-qualified Stock Option shall be
exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the Grant Date.

  



  

6.2 _Exercise Price of an Incentive Stock Option_. Subject to the
provisions of Section 5.2 regarding Ten Percent Stockholders, the Option
Exercise Price of each Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than 100% of
the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option on the Grant
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Incentive Stock Option may be granted
with an Option Exercise Price lower than that set forth in the preceding
sentence if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or
substitution for another option in a manner satisfying the provisions of
Section 424(a) of the Code.

  



  

6.3 _Exercise Price of a Non-qualified Stock Option_. The Option
Exercise Price of each Non-qualified Stock Option shall be not less than 100%
of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option on the
Grant Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Non-qualified Stock Option may
be granted with an Option Exercise Price lower than that set forth in the
preceding sentence if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or
substitution for another option in a manner satisfying the provisions of
Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

6.4 _Consideration_. The Option Exercise Price of Common Stock
acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Laws, either (a) in cash or by certified or bank check at the time
the Option is exercised or (b) in the discretion of the Committee, upon such
terms as the Committee shall approve: (i) by delivery to the Company of other
Common Stock, duly endorsed for transfer to the Company, with a Fair Market
Value on the date of delivery equal to the Option Exercise Price (or portion
thereof) due for the number of shares being acquired, or by means of
attestation whereby the Participant identifies for delivery specific shares
of Common Stock that have an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of
attestation equal to the Option Exercise Price (or portion thereof) and
receives a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the difference between
the number of shares thereby purchased and the number of identified
attestation shares of Common Stock (a "Stock for Stock Exchange"); (ii) a 
"cashless" exercise program established with a broker; (iii) by reduction in
the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon exercise of
such Option with a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Option Exercise
Price at the time of exercise; (iv) by any combination of the foregoing
methods; or (v) in any other form of legal consideration that may be
acceptable to the Committee. Unless otherwise specifically provided in the
Option, the exercise price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to an Option
that is paid by delivery (or attestation) to the Company of other Common Stock
acquired, directly or indirectly from the Company, shall be paid only by
shares of the Common Stock of the Company that have been held for more than
six months (or such longer or shorter period of time required to avoid a
charge to earnings for financial accounting purposes). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, during any period for which the Common Stock is publicly traded
(i.e., the Common Stock is listed on any established stock exchange or a
national market system) an exercise by a Director who is not an Independent
Director or by an Officer that involves or may involve a direct or indirect
extension of credit or arrangement of an extension of credit by the Company,
directly or indirectly, in violation of Section 402(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 shall be prohibited with respect to any Award under the Plan.

  



  

6.5 _Transferability of an Incentive Stock Option_. An Incentive
Stock Option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of
descent and distribution and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the
Optionholder only by the Optionholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Optionholder may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form
satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of the
death of the Optionholder, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the
Option.

  



  

6.6 _Vesting of Options_. Stock Options granted under the Plan
shall be subject to such restrictions and limitations described in the
Award Agreement as the Committee may impose in its discretion, including
vesting conditions, restrictions on exercise, and forfeiture provisions. In
its discretion, the Committee may provide in the Award Agreement that some or
all of such restrictions shall lapse upon (a) the Participant's continued
employment with the Company or an Affiliate for a specified period of time,
(b) the occurrence of any one or more other events or the satisfaction of any
one or more other conditions, as specified by the Committee, including
satisfaction of performance criteria, a termination of Continuous Services
under certain circumstances (such as death or Disability), or a Change in
Control, or (c) a combination of any of the foregoing. In its discretion, the
Committee shall have the authority to accelerate the vesting of a Stock
Option at any time, in whole or in part, or otherwise waive or modify
any such restrictions.

  



  

6.7 _Termination of Continuous Service_. Unless otherwise
provided in an Award Agreement or in an employment agreement the terms of
which have been approved by the Committee, in the event an Optionholder's
Continuous Service terminates (other than upon the Optionholder's death or
Disability), the Optionholder may exercise his or her Option (to the extent
that the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of
termination) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (a)
the date three months following the termination of the Optionholder's
Continuous Service or (b) the expiration of the term of the Option as set
forth in the Award Agreement; _provided that_ , if the termination of
Continuous Service is by the Company for Cause, all outstanding Options
(whether or not vested) shall immediately terminate and cease to be
exercisable. If, after termination, the Optionholder does not exercise his or
her Option within the time specified in the Award Agreement, the Option shall
terminate.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

6.8 _Extension of Termination Date_. An Optionholder's Award
Agreement may also provide that if the exercise of the Option following the
termination of the Optionholder's Continuous Service for any reason would be
prohibited at any time because the issuance of shares of Common Stock would
violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act or any other
state or federal securities law or the rules of any securities exchange or
interdealer quotation system, then the Option shall terminate on the
earlier of (a) the expiration of the term of the Option in accordance with
Section 6.1 or (b) the expiration of a period after termination of the
Participant's Continuous Service that is three months after the end of the
period during which the exercise of the Option would be in violation of such
registration or other securities law requirements.

  



  

6.9 _Disability of Optionholder_. Unless otherwise provided in an
Award Agreement, in the event that an Optionholder's Continuous
Service terminates as a result of the Optionholder's Disability, the
Optionholder may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the
Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of
termination), but only within the period of time ending on the earlier of (a)
the date 12 months following such termination or (b) the expiration of the
term of the Option as set forth in the Award Agreement. If, after
termination, the Optionholder does not exercise his or her Option within the
time specified herein or in the Award Agreement, the Option shall terminate.

  



  

6.10 _Death of Optionholder_. Unless otherwise provided in an
Award Agreement, in the event an Optionholder's Continuous Service
terminates as a result of the Optionholder's death, then the Option may be
exercised (to the extent that the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such
Option as of the date of death) by the Optionholder's estate, by a Person who
acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance or by a
Person designated to exercise the Option upon the Optionholder's death,
but only within the period ending on the earlier of (a) the date 12 months
following the date of death or (b) the expiration of the term of such Option
as set forth in the Award Agreement. If, after the Optionholder's death, the
Option is not exercised within the time specified herein or in the Award
Agreement, the Option shall terminate.

  



  

6.11 _Incentive Stock Option $100,000 Limitation_. To the extent
that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time of grant) of
Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable
for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar year (under all
plans of the Company and its Affiliates) exceeds $100,000, the Options or
portions thereof which exceed such limit (according to the order in which
they were granted) shall be treated as Non-qualified Stock Options.

  



  

7. _Stock Appreciation Rights_. Each Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. Each Stock Appreciation Right so granted shall be subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 7, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award Agreement. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted alone ("Free Standing Rights") or in tandem with an Option granted under the Plan ("Related Rights").

  



  

7.1 _Grant Requirements for Related Rights_. Any Related Right
that relates to a Non-qualified Stock Option may be granted at the same time
the Option is granted or at any time thereafter but before the exercise or
expiration of the Option. Any Related Right that relates to an Incentive
Stock Option must be granted at the same time the Incentive Stock Option is
granted.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

7.2 _Term._  The term of a Stock Appreciation Right granted under
the Plan shall be determined by the Committee; _provided, however_ , no Stock
Appreciation Right shall be exercisable later than the tenth anniversary of
the Grant Date.

  



  

7.3 _Vesting_. Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan shall be
subject to such restrictions and limitations set forth in the Award
Agreement as the Committee may impose in its discretion, including vesting
conditions and forfeiture provisions. In its discretion, the Committee may
provide in the Award Agreement that some or all of such restrictions shall
lapse upon (a) the Participant's continued employment with the Company or an
Affiliate for a specified period of time, (b) the occurrence of any one or
more other events or the satisfaction of any one or more other conditions, as
specified by the Committee, including satisfaction of performance criteria, a
termination of Continuous Services under certain circumstances (such as death
or Disability), or a Change in Control, or (c) a combination of any of the
foregoing. In its discretion, the Committee shall have the authority to
accelerate the vesting of a Stock Appreciation Right at any time, in whole or
in part, or otherwise waive or modify any such restrictions

  



  

7.4 _Exercise and Payment._ Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation
Right, the holder shall be entitled to receive from the Company an
amount equal to the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Stock
Appreciation Right that is being exercised multiplied by the excess of (i)
the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date the Award is
exercised, over (ii) the exercise price specified in the Stock Appreciation
Right or related Option. Payment with respect to the exercise of a Stock
Appreciation Right shall be made on the date of exercise. Payment shall be
made in the form of shares of Common Stock (with or without restrictions as
to substantial risk of forfeiture and transferability, as determined by the
Committee in its sole discretion), cash or a combination thereof, as
determined by the Committee.

  



  

7.5 _Exercise Price._ The exercise price of a Free Standing Right
shall be determined by the Committee, but shall not be less than 100% of the
Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the Grant Date of such Stock
Appreciation Right. A Related Right granted simultaneously with or subsequent
to the grant of an Option and in conjunction therewith or in the alternative
thereto shall have the same exercise price as the related Option, shall be
transferable only upon the same terms and conditions as the related
Option, and shall be exercisable only to the same extent as the related
Option; _provided, however_ , that a Stock Appreciation Right, by its terms,
shall be exercisable only when the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock
subject to the Stock Appreciation Right and related Option exceeds the
exercise price per share thereof and no Stock Appreciation Rights may be
granted in tandem with an Option unless the Committee determines that the
requirements of Section 7.1 are satisfied.

  



  

7.6 _Reduction in the Underlying Option Shares._ Upon any
exercise of a Related Right, the number of shares of Common Stock for which
any related Option shall be exercisable shall be reduced by the number of
shares for which the Stock Appreciation Right has been exercised. The number
of shares of Common Stock for which a Related Right shall be exercisable shall
be reduced upon any exercise of any related Option by the number of shares of
Common Stock for which such Option has been exercised.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

8. _Restricted Awards_ _._ A Restricted Award is an Award of actual shares of Common Stock ("Restricted Stock") or hypothetical Common Stock units ("Restricted Stock Units") having a value equal to the Fair Market Value of an identical number of shares of Common Stock, which may, but need not, provide that such Restricted Award may not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, pledged or hypothecated as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of any obligation or for any other purpose for such period (the "Restricted Period") as the Committee shall determine. Each Restricted Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. Each Restricted Award so granted shall be subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 8, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement.

  



  

8.1 _Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units._

  



  

(a) Each Participant granted Restricted Stock shall execute and
deliver to the Company an Award Agreement with respect to the
Restricted Stock setting forth the restrictions and other terms and
conditions applicable to such Restricted Stock. If the Committee
determines that the Restricted Stock shall be held by the Company or in
escrow rather than delivered to the Participant pending the release of the
applicable restrictions, the Committee may require the Participant to
additionally execute and deliver to the Company (A) an escrow agreement
satisfactory to the Committee, if applicable and (B) the appropriate blank
stock power with respect to the Restricted Stock covered by such agreement.
If a Participant fails to execute an agreement evidencing an Award of
Restricted Stock and, if applicable, an escrow agreement and stock power, the
Award shall be null and void. Subject to the restrictions set forth in the
Award, the Participant generally shall have the rights and privileges of a
stockholder as to such Restricted Stock, including the right to vote such
Restricted Stock and the right to receive dividends; _provided that_ , any
cash dividends and stock dividends with respect to the Restricted Stock shall
be withheld by the Company for the Participant's account, and interest may be
credited on the amount of the cash dividends withheld at a rate and subject to
such terms as determined by the Committee. The cash dividends or stock
dividends so withheld by the Committee and attributable to any particular
share of Restricted Stock (and earnings thereon, if applicable) shall be
distributed to the Participant in cash or, at the discretion of the Committee,
in shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of
such dividends, if applicable, upon the release of restrictions on such share
and, if such share is forfeited, the Participant shall have no right to such
dividends.

  



  

(b) The terms and conditions of a grant of Restricted Stock Units
shall be reflected in an Award Agreement. No shares of Common Stock shall be
issued at the time a Restricted Stock Unit is granted, and the Company will
not be required to set aside funds for the payment of any such Award. A
Participant shall have no voting rights with respect to any Restricted Stock
Units granted hereunder. The Committee may also grant Restricted Stock Units
with a deferral feature, whereby settlement is deferred beyond the vesting
date until the occurrence of a future payment date or event set forth in an
Award Agreement ("Deferred Stock Units"). At the discretion of the Committee,
each Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred Stock Unit (representing one share of
Common Stock) may be credited with an amount equal to the cash and stock
dividends paid by the Company in respect of one share of Common
Stock ("Dividend Equivalents").

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

(c) Dividend Equivalents shall be withheld by the Company and
credited to the Participant's account, and interest may be credited on
the amount of cash Dividend Equivalents credited to the Participant's account
at a rate and subject to such terms as determined by the Committee. Dividend
Equivalents credited to a Participant's account and attributable to any
particular Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred Stock Unit (and earnings
thereon, if applicable) shall be distributed in cash or, at the discretion of
the Committee, in shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to
the amount of such Dividend Equivalents and earnings, if applicable, to the
Participant upon settlement of such Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred Stock
Unit and, if such Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred Stock Unit is forfeited,
the Participant shall have no right to such Dividend Equivalents.

  



  

8.2 _Restrictions._

  



  

(a) Restricted Stock awarded to a Participant shall be subject to
the following restrictions until the expiration of the Restricted Period,
and to such other terms and conditions as may be set forth in the applicable
Award Agreement: (A) if an escrow arrangement is used, the Participant shall
not be entitled to delivery of the stock certificate; (B) the shares shall be
subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in the Award
Agreement; (C) the shares shall be subject to forfeiture to the extent
provided in the applicable Award Agreement; and (D) to the extent such shares
are forfeited, the stock certificates shall be returned to the Company, and
all rights of the Participant to such shares and as a stockholder with respect
to such shares shall terminate without further obligation on the part of the
Company.

  



  

(b) Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units awarded to any
Participant shall be subject to (A) forfeiture until the expiration of the
Restricted Period, and satisfaction of any applicable Performance Goals during
such period, to the extent provided in the applicable Award Agreement, and to
the extent such Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units are forfeited,
all rights of the Participant to such Restricted Stock Units or Deferred
Stock Units shall terminate without further obligation on the part of the
Company and (B) such other terms and conditions as may be set forth in the
applicable Award Agreement.

  



  

(c) The Committee shall have the authority to remove any or all of
the restrictions on the Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Deferred
Stock Units whenever it may determine that, by reason of changes in Applicable
Laws or other changes in circumstances arising after the date the Restricted
Stock or Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units are granted, such
action is appropriate.

  



  

8.3 _Restricted Period_. With respect to Restricted Awards, the
Restricted Period shall commence on the Grant Date and end at the time or
times set forth on a schedule established by the Committee in the applicable
Award Agreement.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

8.4 _Delivery of Restricted Stock and Settlement of Restricted
Stock Units._ Upon the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect
to any shares of Restricted Stock, the restrictions set forth in Section 8.2
and the applicable Award Agreement shall be of no further force or effect
with respect to such shares, except as set forth in the applicable Award
Agreement. If an escrow arrangement is used, upon such expiration, the
Company shall deliver to the Participant, or his or her beneficiary, without
charge, the stock certificate evidencing the shares of Restricted Stock which
have not then been forfeited and with respect to which the Restricted Period
has expired (to the nearest full share) and any cash dividends or stock
dividends credited to the Participant's account with respect to such
Restricted Stock and the interest thereon, if any. Upon the expiration of the
Restricted Period with respect to any outstanding Restricted Stock Units, or
at the expiration of the deferral period with respect to any outstanding
Deferred Stock Units, the Company shall deliver to the Participant, or his or
her beneficiary, without charge, one share of Common Stock for each such
outstanding vested Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred Stock Unit ("Vested
Unit") and cash equal to any Dividend Equivalents credited with respect to
each such Vested Unit in accordance with Section 8.1(c) hereof and the
interest thereon or, at the discretion of the Committee, in shares of Common
Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to such Dividend Equivalents and the
interest thereon, if any; _provided, however_ , that, if explicitly provided
in the applicable Award Agreement, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
elect to pay cash or part cash and part Common Stock in lieu of
delivering only shares of Common Stock for Vested Units. If a cash payment is
made in lieu of delivering shares of Common Stock, the amount of such payment
shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock as of the date on
which the Restricted Period lapsed in the case of Restricted Stock Units, or
the delivery date in the case of Deferred Stock Units, with respect to each
Vested Unit.

  



  

8.5 _Stock Restrictions._ Each certificate representing
Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan shall bear a legend in such form as
the Company deems appropriate.

  



  

9. _Performance Share Awards_ _._ Each Performance Share Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. Each Performance Share Award so granted shall be subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 9, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. The Committee shall have the discretion to determine: (i) the number of shares of Common Stock or stock-denominated units subject to a Performance Share Award granted to any Participant; (ii) the Performance Period applicable to any Award; (iii) the conditions that must be satisfied for a Participant to earn an Award; and (iv) the other terms, conditions and restrictions of the Award.

  



  

9.1 _Earning Performance Share Awards._ The number of Performance
Shares earned by a Participant will depend on the extent to which the
Performance Goals established by the Committee are attained within the
applicable Performance Period, as determined by the Committee.

  



  

10. _Other Equity-Based Awards and Cash Awards._ The Committee may grant Other Equity-Based Awards, either alone or in tandem with other Awards, in such amounts and subject to such conditions as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. Each Other Equity-Based Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement and shall be subject to such conditions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as may be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. The Committee may grant Cash Awards in such amounts and subject to such Performance Goals, other vesting conditions, and such other terms as the Committee determines in its discretion. Cash Awards shall be evidenced in such form as the Committee may determine.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

11. _Securities Law Compliance_. Each Award Agreement shall provide that no shares of Common Stock shall be purchased or sold thereunder unless and until (a) any then applicable requirements of state and federal laws and regulatory agencies have been fully complied with to the satisfaction of the Company and its counsel and (b) if required to do so by the Company, the Participant has executed and delivered to the Company a letter of investment intent in such form and containing such provisions as the Committee may require. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to grant Awards and to issue and sell shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Awards; _provided, however_ , that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act the Plan, any Award or any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority which counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Awards unless and until such authority is obtained.

  



  

12. _Use of Proceeds from Stock_. Proceeds from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to Awards, or upon exercise thereof, shall constitute general funds of the Company.

  



  

13. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

13.1 _Acceleration of Exercisability and Vesting_. The Committee
shall have the power to accelerate the time at which an Award may first be
exercised or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in
accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in the Award stating
the time at which it may first be exercised or the time during which it will
vest.

  



  

13.2 _Stockholder Rights_. Except as provided in the Plan or an
Award Agreement, no Participant shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to
have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares of Common
Stock subject to such Award unless and until such Participant has satisfied
all requirements for exercise of the Award pursuant to its terms and no
adjustment shall be made for dividends (ordinary or extraordinary, whether in
cash, securities or other property) or distributions of other rights for which
the record date is prior to the date such Common Stock certificate is issued,
except as provided in Section 14 hereof.

  



  

13.3 _No Employment or Other Service Rights_. Nothing in the Plan
or any instrument executed or Award granted pursuant thereto shall confer
upon any Participant any right to continue to serve the Company or an
Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the Award was granted or
shall affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (a) the
employment of an Employee with or without notice and with or without Cause or
(b) the service of a Director pursuant to the By-laws of the Company or an
Affiliate, and any applicable provisions of the corporate law of the state in
which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case may be.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

13.4 _Transfer; Approved Leave of Absence_. For purposes of the
Plan, no termination of employment by an Employee shall be deemed to
result from either (a) a transfer of employment to the Company from an
Affiliate or from the Company to an Affiliate, or from one Affiliate to
another, or (b) an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness,
or for any other purpose approved by the Company, if the Employee's right to
reemployment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the
policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the Committee
otherwise so provides in writing, in either case, except to the extent
inconsistent with Section 409A of the Code if the applicable Award is subject
thereto.

  



  

13.5 _Withholding Obligations_. To the extent provided by the
terms of an Award Agreement and subject to the discretion of the Committee,
the Participant may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding
obligation relating to the exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under an
Award by any of the following means (in addition to the Company's right to
withhold from any compensation paid to the Participant by the Company) or by
a combination of such means: (a) tendering a cash payment; (b)
authorizing the Company to withhold shares of Common Stock from the shares of
Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Participant as a result of the
exercise or acquisition of Common Stock under the Award, _provided, however_ ,
that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the
maximum amount of tax required to be withheld by law; or (c) delivering to the
Company previously owned and unencumbered shares of Common Stock of the
Company.

  



  

13.6 _Permitted Transfers_. Awards (other than Incentive Stock
Options) may, in the sole discretion of the Committee, be transferable to a
Permitted Transferee upon written approval by the Committee. Any such
permitted transfer of Awards shall be for zero consideration.

  



  

14. _Adjustments_.

  



  

14.1 _Adjustments Upon Changes in Stock_. In the event of any
changes in the outstanding Common Stock or in the capital structure of the
Company by reason of any dividend (other than regular cash dividends) or
other distribution (whether in the form of cash, shares of Common Stock,
other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse
stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, split-off,
spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of shares of Common Stock or
other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to
acquire shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company or other
relevant change in capitalization (any of the foregoing, an "Adjustment
Event"), the Committee shall, in respect of any such Adjustment Event, make
such proportionate substitution or adjustment, if any, as it deems equitable,
to any or all of: (i) the Total Share Reserve, or any other limit applicable
under the Plan with respect to the number of Awards which may be granted
hereunder; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of
the Company (or number and kind of other securities or other property) which
may be issued in respect of Awards or with respect to which Awards may be
granted under the Plan; and (iii) the terms of any outstanding Award,
including, without limitation, (A) the number of shares of Common Stock or
other securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or
other property) subject to outstanding Awards or to which outstanding Awards
relate; (B) the exercise price with respect to any Award; or (C) any
applicable performance measures; _provided_ , that in the case of any "equity
restructuring" (within the meaning of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (or any successor pronouncement
thereto)), the Committee shall make an equitable or proportionate adjustment
to outstanding Awards to reflect such equity restructuring. In the case of
adjustments made pursuant to this Section 14, unless the Committee
specifically determines that such adjustment is in the best interests of the
Company or its Affiliates, the Committee shall, in the case of Incentive
Stock Options, ensure that any adjustments under this Section 14 will not
constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the Incentive Stock
Options within the meaning of Section 424(h)(3) of the Code and in the case
of Non-qualified Stock Options, ensure that any adjustments under this Section
14 will not constitute a modification of such Non-qualified Stock Options
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Any adjustments made under
this Section 14 shall be made in a manner which does not adversely affect the
exemption provided pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. The Company

notice, such adjustment shall be final, conclusive and binding for all

acquiring company);

  



  

(b) acceleration of the exercisability of an Award, lapse of
restrictions on an Award, or alteration of the period of time for Participants
to exercise outstanding Awards prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control
(which shall be a period of at least ten days); and

  



  

(c) subject to any limitations or reductions as may be necessary
to comply with Section 409A of the Code, cancellation of any one or
more outstanding Awards and payment to the holders of such Awards of the
value of such Awards, if any, as shall be determined by the Committee as
follows:

  



  

(i) in the case of an outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation
Right, a cash payment in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair
Market Value (as of a date specified by the Committee) of the shares of Common
Stock subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right over the aggregate
exercise price of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right (it being understood
that, in such event, any Option or Stock Appreciation Right having a per
share exercise price specified in the Award Agreement that is equal to, or in
excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock subject thereto
may be canceled and terminated without any payment or
consideration therefor), or

  



  

(ii) in the case of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units,
Performance Share Awards, Cash Awards or Other Equity-Based Awards that
are not vested as of such cancellation, a cash payment or equity subject to
deferred vesting and delivery consistent with the same vesting restrictions

Awards, Cash Awards or Other Equity-Based Awards prior to cancellation, or
the underlying shares in respect thereof, with Performance Goals with respect
to each outstanding Performance Period, if any, that are applicable to such
Awards deemed to be achieved at the greater of 100% of the applicable
"target" performance levels and the performance levels actually achieved as of
the date of such event, as determined by the Committee.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

Payments to holders pursuant to clause (c) above shall be made in cash or, in
the sole discretion of the Committee, in the form of shares of Common Stock,
or such other consideration necessary for a Participant to receive property,
cash, or securities (or combination thereof) as such Participant would have
been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of the Change in Control if
the Participant had been, immediately prior to such Change in Control, the
holder of the number of shares of Common Stock covered by the Award at such
time (less any applicable exercise price).

  



  

14.3 _Other Requirements_. Prior to any payment or adjustment
contemplated under this Section 14, the Committee may require a
Participant to (a) represent and warrant as to the unencumbered title to the
Participant's Awards; (b) bear such Participant's pro rata share of any post-
closing indemnity obligations, and be subject to the same post-closing
purchase price adjustments, escrow terms, offset rights, holdback terms, and
similar conditions as the other holders of Common Stock, subject to any
limitations or reductions as may be necessary to comply with Section 409A of
the Code; and (iii) deliver customary transfer documentation as reasonably

time, may amend or terminate the Plan. However, except as provided in Section
14 relating to adjustments upon changes in Common Stock and Section 15.3, no
amendment shall be effective unless approved by the stockholders of the
Company to the extent stockholder approval is necessary to satisfy any
Applicable Laws. At the time of such amendment, the Board shall determine,
upon advice from counsel, whether such amendment will be contingent on
stockholder approval.

  



  

15.2 _Stockholder Approval_. The Board may, in its sole
discretion, submit any other amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval.

  



  

15.3 _Contemplated Amendments_. It is expressly contemplated that
the Board may amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or
advisable to provide eligible Employees, Consultants and Independent
Directors with the maximum benefits provided or to be provided under the
provisions of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder relating to
Incentive Stock Options or to the nonqualified deferred compensation
provisions of Section 409A of the Code and/or to bring the Plan and/or Awards
granted under it into compliance therewith.

  



  

15.4 _No Impairment of Rights_. Rights under any Award granted
before amendment of the Plan shall not be materially impaired by any
amendment of the Plan unless (a) the Company requests the consent of the
Participant and (b) the Participant consents in writing.

  



  

15.5 _Amendment of Awards_. The Committee at any time, and from
time to time, may amend the terms of any one or more Awards; _provided,
however_ , that the Committee may not affect any amendment which would
otherwise constitute an impairment of the rights under any Award unless (a)
the Company requests the consent of the Participant and (b) the Participant
consents in writing.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

16. _General Provisions_.

  



  

16.1 _Forfeiture Events_. The Committee may specify in an Award
Agreement that the Participant's rights, payments and benefits with
respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture
or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain events, in addition to
applicable vesting conditions of an Award. Such events may include, without
limitation, breach of non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, or
other restrictive covenants that are contained in the Award Agreement or
otherwise applicable to the Participant, a termination of the Participant's
Continuous Service for Cause, or other conduct by the Participant that is
detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company and/or its
Affiliates.

  



  

16.2 _Clawback_. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this
Plan, the Company may cancel any Award, require reimbursement of any Award by
a Participant, and effect any other right of recoupment of equity or other
compensation provided under the Plan in connection with the following: (a)
any material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the
securities Laws that requires the Company to file a restatement of its
financial statements; (b) any action by a Participant that constitutes Cause;
and (c) any Company policies that may be adopted and/or modified from time to
time. In addition, a Participant may be required to repay to the Company
previously paid compensation, whether provided pursuant to the Plan or an
Award Agreement, in accordance with the Plan. By accepting an Award, the
Participant is agreeing to be bound by this Section 16.2, as in effect or as
may be adopted and/or modified from time to time by the Company in its
discretion (including, without limitation, to comply with Applicable Law).

  



  

16.3 _Other Compensation Arrangements_. Nothing contained in the
Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional
compensation arrangements, subject to stockholder approval if such approval
is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or
applicable only in specific cases.

  



  

16.4 _Sub-Plans_. The Committee may from time to time establish
sub-plans under the Plan for purposes of satisfying securities, tax or other
laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company intends to grant Awards.
Any sub-plans shall contain such limitations and other terms and conditions
as the Committee determines are necessary or desirable. All sub-plans shall be
deemed a part of the Plan, but each sub-plan shall apply only to the
Participants in the jurisdiction for which the sub-plan was designed.

  



  

16.5 _Deferral of Awards_. The Committee may establish one or
more programs under the Plan to permit selected Participants the
opportunity to elect to defer receipt of consideration upon exercise of an
Award, satisfaction of performance criteria, or other event that absent the
election would entitle the Participant to payment or receipt of shares of
Common Stock or other consideration under an Award. The Committee may
establish the election procedures, the timing of such elections, the
mechanisms for payments of, and accrual of interest or other earnings, if
any, on amounts, shares or other consideration so deferred, and such other
terms, conditions, rules and procedures that the Committee deems advisable
for the administration of any such deferral program.

  



  

16.6 _Unfunded Plan_. The Plan shall be unfunded. Neither the
Company, the Board nor the Committee shall be required to establish any
special or separate fund or to segregate any assets to assure the performance
of its obligations under the Plan.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

16.7 _Delivery_. Upon exercise of a right granted under the Plan,
the Company shall issue Common Stock or pay any amounts due within a
reasonable period of time thereafter. Subject to any statutory or regulatory
obligations the Company may otherwise have, for purposes of the Plan, 30 days
shall be considered a reasonable period of time.

  



  

16.8 _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Common Stock
shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan, including pursuant to any
adjustment under Section 14\. The Committee shall determine whether cash,
additional Awards or other securities or property shall be issued or paid in
lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock or whether any fractional shares
should be rounded, forfeited or otherwise eliminated.

  



  

16.9 _Other Provisions_. The Award Agreements authorized under
the Plan may contain such other provisions not inconsistent with the
Plan, including, without limitation, restrictions upon the exercise of
Awards, as the Committee may deem advisable.

  



  

16.10 _Section 409A_. The Plan is intended to comply with
Section 409A of the Code to the extent subject thereto, and, accordingly, to
the maximum extent permitted, the Plan shall be interpreted and administered
to be in compliance therewith. Any payments described in the Plan that are
due within the "short-term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A of the
Code shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless Applicable Laws
require otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, to
the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and tax penalties under
Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and
benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to the Plan during the six
(6) month period immediately following the Participant's termination of
Continuous Service shall instead be paid on the first payroll date after the
six-month anniversary of the Participant's separation from service (or the
Participant's death, if earlier). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor the Committee shall have any obligation to take any action to
prevent the assessment of any additional tax or penalty on any Participant
under Section 409A of the Code and neither the Company nor the Committee will
have any liability to any Participant for such tax or penalty.

  



  

16.11 _Disqualifying Dispositions_. Any Participant who shall
make a "disposition" (as defined in Section 424 of the Code) of all or any
portion of shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of an Incentive Stock
Option within two years from the Grant Date of such Incentive Stock Option or
within one year after the issuance of the shares of Common Stock acquired upon
exercise of such Incentive Stock Option (a "Disqualifying Disposition") shall
be required to immediately advise the Company in writing as to the occurrence
of the sale and the price realized upon the sale of such shares of Common
Stock.

  



  

16.12 _Section 16_. It is the intent of the Company that the
Plan satisfy, and be interpreted in a manner that satisfies, the applicable
requirements of Rule 16b-3 as promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange
Act so that Participants will be entitled to the benefit of Rule 16b-3, or
any other rule promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and will not
be subject to short-swing liability under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
Accordingly, if the operation of any provision of the Plan would
conflict with the intent expressed in this Section 16.12, such provision to
the extent possible shall be interpreted and/or deemed amended so as to avoid
such conflict.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

16.13 _Beneficiary Designation_. Each Participant under the Plan
may from time to time name any beneficiary or beneficiaries by whom any
right under the Plan is to be exercised in case of such Participant's death.
Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant,
shall be in a form reasonably prescribed by the Committee and shall be
effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company
during the Participant's lifetime.

  



  

16.14 _Expenses_. The costs of administering the Plan shall be
paid by the Company.

  



  

16.15 _Severability_. If any of the provisions of the Plan or any
Award Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, whether in
whole or in part, such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent, but
only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability and
the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby.

  



  

16.16 _Plan Headings_. The headings in the Plan are for purposes
of convenience only and are not intended to define or limit the
construction of the provisions hereof.

  



  

16.17 _Non-Uniform Treatment_. The Committee's determinations
under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made by it selectively
among Persons who are eligible to receive, or actually receive, Awards.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee shall be
entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations, amendments and
adjustments, and to enter into non-uniform and selective Award Agreements.

  



  

17. _Effective Date of Plan_. The Plan shall become effective as of the Effective Date.

  



  

18. _Termination or Suspension of the Plan_. The Plan shall terminate automatically on [Date will be ten years from the effective date]. No Award shall be granted pursuant to the Plan after such date, but Awards theretofore granted may extend beyond that date. The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any earlier date pursuant to Section 15.1 hereof. No Awards may be granted under the Plan while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated.

  



  

19. _Choice of Law_. The law of the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all claims or matters related to or arising from the Plan (including any tort or non-contractual claims) and (b) any questions concerning the construction, interpretation, validity and enforcement of the Plan, without giving effect to any choice-of-law or conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 3.7 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_. The
Law of the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all Actions, claims or
matters related to or arising from this Standstill Agreement (including any
tort or non-contractual claims) and (b) any questions concerning the
construction, interpretation, validity and enforceability of this Standstill
Agreement, and the performance of the obligations imposed by this Standstill
Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict
of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. EACH PARTY TO THIS STANDSTILL
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES (WHETHER
ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH,
RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS STANDSTILL AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS STANDSTILL AGREEMENT AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIPS
ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES UNDER THIS STANDSTILL AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES
FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH SUCH
PARTY'S LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES SUCH
PARTY'S JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of
the Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware or if such court declines jurisdiction, then to
the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware, in any Action
arising out of or relating to this Standstill Agreement, agrees that all
claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and determined in any such
court and agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this
Standstill Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in this _Section 3.7_,
however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by Law or at equity. Each Party agrees that a final
judgment in any Action so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law or at equity.

  



  

Section 3.8 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby agrees and
acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damages that
would be suffered if the Parties fail to comply with any of the obligations
imposed on them by this Standstill Agreement and that, in the event of any
such failure, an aggrieved Party will be irreparably damaged and will not have
an adequate remedy at Law. Any such Party shall, therefore, be entitled (in
addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled at Law or in
equity) to seek injunctive relief, including specific performance, to enforce
such obligations, without the posting of any bond, and if any Action should
be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Standstill
Agreement, none of the Parties shall raise the defense that there is an
adequate remedy at Law.

Re: Offer of Employment

  



  

Dear Dylan:

  



  

1. _Defined Terms_

  



  

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Offer Letter (as defined
below) shall have the meanings set forth on _Appendix A_ attached hereto.

  



  

2. _Offer and Position_

  



  

We are very pleased to extend an offer of employment to you for the position
of Chief Executive Officer (" _CEO_ ") of Utz Brands, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _PubCo_ "), effective upon and following the
consummation of the transactions (collectively, the  " _Transaction_ ")
contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement (the " _Business
Combination Agreement_ "), dated as of June 5, 2020, by and among Collier
Creek Holdings (" _CCH_ "), a Cayman Islands exempted company, which shall
domesticate as a Delaware corporation, Utz Brands Holdings, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the " _Company_ "), Series U of UM Partners, LLC,
a series of a Delaware limited liability company, and Series R of UM
Partners, LLC, a series of a Delaware limited liability company. Your
employment will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
letter (the " _Offer Letter_ "). This Offer Letter will be binding upon
execution but the obligations under this Offer Letter are not effective until
the consummation of the Transaction (with the date on which the Transaction
is consummated, the " _Closing Date_ ") and if the Business Combination
Agreement terminates in accordance with Article XI of the Business
Combination Agreement, then this Offer Letter will be null and void _ab
initio_. The board of directors of PubCo (the " _Board_ ") will take all such
actions required for you to be appointed as CEO as of the Start Date (as
defined below).

  



  

3. _Duties, Authority and Responsibilities_

  



  

In your capacity as CEO, you will have such duties, authorities and
responsibilities as are (i) commensurate with such title (including managing
the day-to-day business activities of PubCo and its subsidiaries subject to
oversight by the Board), (ii) required of such position (including but not
limited to such responsibilities as set forth in PubCo's Bylaws) and (iii)
assigned to you from time to time that are reasonably consistent with your
position. You will report directly to the Board and will comply with PubCo's
written policies during your employment with PubCo. You agree to devote
substantially all of your business time and attention to the performance of
your duties; provided that following the Closing Date, (A) you will continue
to serve as CEO of the Company and its subsidiaries; (B) you will be
permitted to perform any role for any "Rice family owned" entity that is a
non-operating entity and/or trust; (C) you shall not be precluded from
engaging in civic, charitable or religious activities, (D) you shall not be
precluded from serving on the board of directors of other companies that are
not competitors to PubCo or its subsidiaries and that are approved by the
Board, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, _provided however_ ,
that while you are CEO you will not serve on more than one other board of
directors for any other company that is a public company (i.e., a company
subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended) and (E) you shall not be precluded from managing your and your
family's personal passive investments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
outside activities must be in compliance with PubCo's Code of Ethics,
including approval procedures, and must not materially interfere with your
duties as CEO.

  



   

 



    



  

  

4. _Start Date_

  



  

Your start date will be the first business day after the Closing Date (the "
_Start Date_ ").

  



  

5. _Base Salary_

  



  

In consideration of your services, you will be paid an initial base salary of
$750,000 per year, subject to at least annual reviews for increases by the
Compensation Committee of the Board (the " _Committee_ "), payable in
accordance with the standard payroll practices of PubCo. Your initial base
salary and any such upward adjustment in initial base salary shall constitute
" _Base Salary_ " for the purposes of this Offer Letter.

  



  

6. _Annual Bonus Award_

  



  

During your employment, you will be eligible to participate in PubCo's annual
bonus award plan, with terms and conditions as approved by the Committee, and
as part of the same annual bonus award plan as other named executive officers
of PubCo. Your target bonus opportunity will be 100% of your Base Salary,
subject to annual review by the Committee, with a maximum bonus opportunity of
200% of your Base Salary. Your actual bonus payment will be based on
performance as measured against goals approved annually by the Committee. For
fiscal year 2020, your goals for your annual bonus award are set forth in
PubCo's summary annual bonus award plan for 2020 and your award
thereunder, both of which [have been approved by the Board of Directors or
the Compensation Committee of CCH]1 and are attached hereto as Exhibit A. For
fiscal years 2021 and thereafter, your goals for your annual bonus award will
be set forth in PubCo's summary annual bonus award plan for such fiscal year
and your award thereunder, each as adopted by the Committee after
consultation with you.

  



  

7. _PubCo 's 2020 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan_

  



  

During your employment with PubCo, you will be eligible to participate in
PubCo's 2020 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B, as mutually agreed upon by CCH and the Company pursuant to the
Business Combination Agreement, approved by PubCo's stockholders, and amended
from time to time thereafter (the " _OEIP_ "), and receive equity awards
thereunder in the form as determined by the Committee, and subject to vesting
and other conditions as set forth in the OEIP and the applicable award
agreements.

value to be awarded in the form of a stock option (the " _Initial Option
Grant_ ") exercisable for shares of PubCo's Class A common stock, $0.0001 par
value per share (" _Class A Common Stock_") and 50% of the grant value to be
awarded in the form of performance share units (the " _Initial PSU Grant_ ").

attached hereto as Exhibits C and D.]2

restricted stock units that settle in shares of Class A Common Stock issued
under the OEIP (the " _Converted RSU Grant_ ") in accordance with the terms
of the Converted RSU Grant in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
E.3 Contingent upon the closing under the Business Combination Agreement, you
hereby agree to consent to such amendment and to making such election for
conversion. Following the Closing Date, you will retain your existing LTIP
awards, as so amended, and remain eligible to vest in any unvested portion
thereof. For clarity and the avoidance of doubt, Utz Quality Foods, LLC will
make no new awards under the LTIP following the Closing Date.

Following the Start Date, you will participate in the Utz Brands, Inc.
Executive Severance Benefit Plan and the Utz Brands, Inc. Change in Control

hereto as Exhibits F-1 and F-2,4 in accordance with its terms and conditions
as in effect from time to time.

11. _Withholding_

  



  

All forms of compensation paid to you as an employee of PubCo shall be less
all applicable withholdings.

  



  

12. _At-will Employment_

  



  

Your employment with PubCo will be for no specific period of time. Rather,
your employment will be at-will, meaning that you or the Board may terminate
your employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or
without notice and for any reason or no particular reason. Although your
compensation and benefits may change from time to time, the at-will nature of
your employment may only be changed by an express written agreement signed on
behalf of PubCo by an authorized officer of PubCo. Upon any termination of
your employment with PubCo, you will immediately and without the need for any
additional action be deemed to have resigned from all officer positions
with PubCo, the Company, and each of their respective subsidiaries and as a
member of the governing boards of the Company and its subsidiaries but not as
a member of the Board.

  



  

13. _Governing Law, Disputes and Waiver of Jury Trial_

  



  

This Offer Letter shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to conflict of law principles, and any dispute between the
parties will be resolved only in the courts of the State of Delaware or in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the
appellate courts having jurisdiction of appeals in such courts. You and PubCo
hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to trial by
jury resulting from any proceeding or cause of action brought to resolve any
dispute between the parties arising out of, connected with, or related to
your employment after the Closing Date with PubCo, the Company, or any of its
subsidiaries, whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise.

  



  

14. _Representations_

  



  

You represent that you are not party to any agreement that would limit your
ability to discharge your duties to PubCo, the Company and their respective
subsidiaries. As a condition of accepting this offer of employment, you agree
to be subject to PubCo's terms of employment which include
restrictive covenants, assignment of inventions, confidentiality and non-
disparagement, and non-competition and non-solicitation of
employees, customers and suppliers provisions, all as set forth in the form
of agreement as attached hereto as Exhibit G.

  



  

15. _Section 409A_

  



  

The intent of the parties is that the payments and benefits under this Offer
Letter comply with or be exempt from Section 409A and accordingly, to the
maximum extent permitted, this Offer Letter shall be interpreted to be in
compliance therewith.

  



  

If any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to you under this
Offer Letter in connection with your "separation from service" (within the
meaning of Section 409A) is determined, in whole or in part, to constitute
"nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A and
you are a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(2)(B)(i), no part of
such payments shall be paid before the day that is six months plus one day
after the date of termination or, if earlier, ten (10) business days following
your death (the " _New Payment Date_ "). The aggregate of any payments and
benefits that otherwise would have been paid and/or provided to you during
the period between the date of termination and the New Payment Date shall be
paid to you in a lump sum on such New Payment Date. Thereafter, any payments
and/or benefits that remain outstanding as of the day immediately following
the New Payment Date shall be paid without delay over the time period
originally scheduled, in accordance with the terms of this Offer Letter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the
foregoing delay applies to the provision of any ongoing welfare benefits, you
shall pay the full cost of premiums for such welfare benefits due and
payable prior to the New Payment Date and PubCo will pay you an amount equal
to the amount of such premiums which otherwise would have been paid by PubCo
during such period within five (5) business days following its conclusion.

A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes
of any provision of this Offer Letter providing for the payment of any amounts
or benefits subject to Section 409A upon or following a termination of
employment unless such termination is also a "separation from service" within
the meaning of Section 409A, and for purposes of any such provision of this
Offer Letter, references to a "resignation," "termination," "terminate,"
"termination of employment" or like terms shall mean separation from service.

  



  

All expenses or other reimbursements as provided herein shall be payable in
accordance with PubCo's policies in effect from time to time, but in any event
shall be made on or prior to the last day of the taxable year following the
taxable year in which you incurred the expenses. With regard to any
provision herein that provides for reimbursement of costs and expenses or in-
kind benefits, except as permitted by Section 409A: (i) the right to
reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or
exchange for another benefit; and (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for
reimbursements or in-kind benefits provided during any taxable year shall not
affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits to be
provided in any other taxable year.

  



  

For purposes of Section 409A, your right to receive any installment payments
pursuant to this Offer Letter shall be treated as a right to receive a series
of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Offer
Letter specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (e.g.,
payment shall be made within 30 days following the date of termination), the
actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole
discretion of PubCo.

  



  

If you wish to accept this position, please sign below and return this Offer
Letter to me within [●] days. This offer is open for you to accept until
[____________, 2020], at which time it will be deemed to be withdrawn.
