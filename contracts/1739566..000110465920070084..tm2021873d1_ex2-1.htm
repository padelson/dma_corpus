The Utz Companies have in effect policies of insurance in amounts and scope of coverage as set forth on <U>Section&nbsp;3.16</U>

Policy is valid, binding and enforceable on the applicable Utz Company in accordance with its terms, except as such may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Laws affecting creditors&rsquo; rights generally and by general equitable principles.
All premiums due under such Insurance Policies have been paid in accordance with the terms of such Insurance Policy. All Insurance
Policies maintained for the benefit of the Utz Companies are maintained by the Utz Companies. The amount and scope of coverage
of the Insurance Policies are customary, adequate and suitable for companies of a similar nature and size operating in the industries
that the Utz Companies operate in and such Insurance Policies are sufficient for the current needs of the business of the Utz
Companies. No Utz Company is in material breach or material default under, nor has it taken any action or failed to take any action

increase in premium, cancellation, material reduction in coverage, material denial or non-renewal with respect to any Insurance
Policy. During the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Date, no Utz Company has received any written notice of material
increase in premium (other than customary annual increases), cancellation, material reduction in coverage, material denial or
nonrenewal of any Insurance Policy. Except as set forth on <U>Section&nbsp;3.16</U> of the Company and Sellers&rsquo; Disclosure
Letter, during the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Date, there have been no material claims by or with respect to the
Utz Companies under any Insurance Policy as to which coverage has been denied or disputed in any material respect by the underwriters
of such Insurance Policy. Since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, no Utz Company has (a)&nbsp;failed to maintain in full force
and effect any material Insurance Policy or (b)&nbsp;suffered any damage, destruction, theft or casualty loss to its tangible
assets in excess of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) that is not covered by insurance. Except as set forth on <U>Section&nbsp;3.16

Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be possible.</P>

The headings and captions used in this Agreement and the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Disclosure Letter,
Schedule or Exhibit&nbsp;attached hereto or delivered at the same time and not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings
set forth in this Agreement. The use of the word &ldquo;including&rdquo; herein shall mean &ldquo;including without limitation.&rdquo;
The words &ldquo;hereof,&rdquo; &ldquo;herein,&rdquo; and &ldquo;hereunder&rdquo; and words of similar import, when used in this
Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. References herein to
a specific Section, Subsection, Clause, Recital, Section&nbsp;of a Disclosure Letter, Schedule or Exhibit&nbsp;shall refer, respectively,
to Sections, Subsections, Clauses, Recitals, Sections of a Disclosure Letter, Schedules&nbsp;or Exhibits&nbsp;of this Agreement.
Terms defined in the singular shall have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice versa. References herein to any
gender shall include each other gender. The word &ldquo;or&rdquo; shall not be exclusive unless the context clearly requires the
selection of one (1)&nbsp;(but not more than one (1)) of a number of items. References to &ldquo;written&rdquo; or &ldquo;in writing&rdquo;
include in electronic form. References herein to any Person shall include such Person&rsquo;s heirs, executors, personal representatives,
administrators, successors and permitted assigns; <U>provided</U>,&nbsp;<U>however</U>, that nothing contained in this <U>Section&nbsp;12.5
</U>is intended to authorize any assignment or transfer not otherwise permitted by this Agreement. References herein to a Person
in a particular capacity or capacities shall exclude such Person in any other capacity. Any reference to &ldquo;days&rdquo; shall
mean calendar days unless Business Days are specified; <U>provided</U> that if any action is required to be done or taken on a
day that is not a Business Day, then such action shall be required to be done or taken not on such day but on the first succeeding
Business Day thereafter. References herein to any Contract (including this Agreement) mean such Contract as amended, restated,
supplemented or modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof; <U>provided that</U> with respect to any Contract
listed (or required to be listed) on the Disclosure Letters, all material amendments and modifications thereto (but excluding
any purchase orders, work orders or statements of work) must also be listed on the appropriate section of the applicable Disclosure
Letter. With respect to the determination of any period of time, the word &ldquo;from&rdquo; means &ldquo;from and including&rdquo;
and the words &ldquo;to&rdquo; and &ldquo;until&rdquo; each means &ldquo;to but excluding.&rdquo; References herein to any Law
shall be deemed also to refer to such Law, as amended, and all rules&nbsp;and regulations promulgated thereunder. If any Party
has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement in any respect, the fact that there
exists another representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) which the Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach
of the first representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The word &ldquo;extent&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;to the extent&rdquo;
(or similar phrases) shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply &ldquo;if.&rdquo;
An accounting term not otherwise defined in this Agreement has the meaning assigned to it in accordance with GAAP. Except where
otherwise provided, all amounts in this Agreement are stated and shall be paid in United States dollars. The Parties and their
respective counsel have reviewed and negotiated this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the Parties, and the
language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no
rule&nbsp;of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. Any information or materials shall be deemed provided, made
available or delivered to the Buyer if such information or materials have been uploaded to the electronic data room maintained
by Sellers and their financial advisors on the Firmex online-platform for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the &ldquo;<U>Data Room</U>&rdquo;) or otherwise provided to the Buyer&rsquo;s representatives (including counsel) via electronic
mail, in each case, prior to the Effective Date. The content of the Data Room as of the Effective Date will be stored on six (6)&nbsp;identical
encrypted USB devices, and Sellers will cause three (3)&nbsp;such devices to be sent to the Buyer within thirty days of the Effective
Date.</P>

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may now or hereafter be organized
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the &ldquo;<U>DGCL</U>&rdquo;). The Corporation is being incorporated
in connection with the domestication of Collier Creek Holdings, a Cayman Islands exempted company limited by shares (&ldquo;<U>Collier
Creek Cayman</U>&rdquo;), to a Delaware corporation (the &ldquo;<U>Domestication</U>&rdquo;), and this Certificate of Incorporation
is being filed simultaneously with the Certificate of Corporate Domestication of Collier Creek Cayman (the &ldquo;<U>Certificate
of Domestication</U>&rdquo;).</P>

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is [ &#9679; ] shares, consisting
of (i)&nbsp;[ &#9679; ] shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (&ldquo;<U>Preferred Stock</U>&rdquo;), (ii)&nbsp;[
 &#9679; ] shares of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (&ldquo;<U>Class&nbsp;A Common Stock</U>&rdquo;), (iii)&nbsp;2,000,000
shares of Class&nbsp;B Non-Voting Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (&ldquo;<U>Class&nbsp;B Common Stock</U>&rdquo;),
which shall be divided into 1,000,000 shares of Series&nbsp;B-1 Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (&ldquo;<U>Series&nbsp;B-1
Common Stock</U>&rdquo;) and 1,000,000 shares of Series&nbsp;B-2 Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (&ldquo;<U>Series&nbsp;B-2
Common Stock</U>&rdquo;) and (v)&nbsp;[&nbsp;&#9679; ] shares of Class&nbsp;V Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (&ldquo;<U>Class&nbsp;V
Common Stock</U>&rdquo; and, together with the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, and the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock (the &ldquo;<U>Common
Stock</U>&rdquo;). The number of authorized shares of any of the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, Class&nbsp;V
Common Stock, or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares of such class or series then
outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section&nbsp;242(b)(2)&nbsp;of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and
no vote of the holders of any of the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, the Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, the Class&nbsp;V Common Stock or
Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor, unless a vote of any such holder is required pursuant
to this Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock. Upon the filing
of the Certificate of Domestication and this Certificate of Incorporation, which shall occur on the closing date (such date, the
 &ldquo;<U>Closing Date</U>&rdquo;) of the transactions contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of
June&nbsp;[&#9679;], 2020, by and among Collier Creek Cayman, Utz Brands Holdings, LLC (&ldquo;<U>LLC</U>&rdquo;), Series&nbsp;U
of UM Partners, LLC (&ldquo;<U>Series&nbsp;U</U>&rdquo;) and Series&nbsp;R of UM Partners, LLC (&ldquo;<U>Series&nbsp;R</U>&rdquo;
and together with Series&nbsp;U, the &ldquo;<U>Sellers</U>&rdquo;), each share of capital stock of Collier Creek Cayman issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) will for all purposes be deemed
to be one issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable share of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, without any action required
on the part of the Corporation or the holders thereof; provided, however, in accordance with the terms of the Side Letter (as
defined below), an aggregate 1,000,000 Founder Shares (as defined therein) shall automatically convert into Series&nbsp;B-1 Common
Stock and an aggregate 1,000,000 Founder Shares shall automatically convert into Series&nbsp;B-2 Common Stock.</P>

dated on or about the date hereof, by and among the Corporation, the Sellers, the CCH Sponsor and the other parties party thereto,

Subject to the Investor Rights Agreement, the directors (other than those directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred

meeting of stockholders following the Closing Date and Class&nbsp;III directors shall initially serve for a term expiring at the
third annual meeting of stockholders following the Closing Date. At each annual meeting following the Closing Date, successors
to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding
annual meeting of stockholders. If the number of such directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among
the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any such additional director
of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term
that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove, or

by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article&nbsp;IV or otherwise shall

the Company not being the surviving entity in such merger) an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal or applicable state

Units (such that following the occurrence of a Continuing Member COC, no Continuing Member will hold any Restricted Common Units
and following the occurrence of a Sponsor COC, PubCo will not hold any Restricted Common Units). If a First Tier Vesting Event
has not occurred at the time of the occurrence of a Second Tier Vesting Event, such First Tier Vesting Event shall also occur upon
the occurrence of the Second Tier Vesting Event, such that all of the then outstanding Restricted Common Units shall vest in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this LLC Agreement, if, upon the
occurrence of a Vesting Event, a filing is required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (&ldquo;<B><U>HSR
Act</U></B>&rdquo;) for the immediate conversion of any Restricted Common Unit into an equal number of Common Units, then the Conversion
Date with respect to all Restricted Common Units which would convert into an equal number of Common Units resulting from such Vesting
Event shall be delayed until the earlier of (i)&nbsp;such time as the required filing under the HSR Act has been made and the waiting
period applicable to such conversion under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated or (ii)&nbsp;such filing is no longer
required, at which time such conversion shall automatically occur without any further action by the holders of any such Restricted
Common Unit. Each of the Continuing Members and PubCo agree to promptly take all actions required to make such filing under the
HSR Act and the filing fee for such filing shall be paid by the Company. On the Conversion Date with respect to any Restricted
Common Unit held by a Continuing Member, PubCo shall issue, for each Restricted Common Unit which has converted to a Common Unit
under this LLC Agreement, one share of Class&nbsp;V Common Stock to such Continuing Member. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event of a subdivision or combination referred to in <U>Section&nbsp;4.1(i)(i)</U>&nbsp;or <U>Section&nbsp;4(i)(ii)</U>, the number
of shares of Class&nbsp;V Common Stock to which a Continuing Member shall be entitled upon vesting of its Restricted Common Units
shall equal the number of Restricted Common Units held by the Continuing Members as a result of such subdivision or combination
that have converted into Common Units. PubCo hereby agrees to reserve for issuance at all times an adequate number of shares of
Class&nbsp;V Common Stock to permit the issuance of all Class&nbsp;V Common Stock assuming all of the Continuing Members&rsquo;
Restricted Common Units vest under this LLC Agreement. To the extent that, on or before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, a Vesting Event has not occurred with respect to a Restricted Common Unit, and a Restricted Common Unit has not vested and
converted into a Common Unit under this LLC Agreement, then immediately and without any further action under this LLC Agreement,
on the date that is the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Time, all such Restricted Common Units outstanding under this
LLC Agreement shall be canceled and extinguished for no consideration.</FONT></P>

(&ldquo;<B><U>Tax Advances</U></B>&rdquo;), the Managing Member may cause the Company to withhold such amounts and cause the Company
to make such tax payments as so required, and each Member hereby authorizes the Company to do so. All Tax Advances made on behalf
of a Member shall be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding Tax Distribution or Tax Distributions and,
if applicable, the proceeds of liquidation that would otherwise have been made to such Member under this LLC Agreement; <U>provided</U>,
that if a Tax Advance is made on behalf of a former Member, then such former Member shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company
for the entire amount of such Tax Advance. For all purposes of this LLC Agreement, such Member shall be treated as having received
the amount of the distribution, if applicable, that is equal to the Tax Advance at the time of such Tax Advance and (if applicable)
as having paid such Tax Advance to the relevant taxing jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the aggregate
amount of Tax Advances for any period made on behalf of a Member exceeds the actual Tax Distributions that would have otherwise
been made to such Member during the fifteen (15) months following such Tax Advances, then such Member shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company for the entire amount of such excess (which has not offset Tax Distributions pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;10.5</U>);
<U>provided</U>, that such indemnification obligation shall be the several obligation of such Member and shall not be treated as
Capital Contributions. For the avoidance of doubt, any income taxes, penalties, additions to tax and interest payable by the Company
or any fiscally transparent entity in which the Company owns an interest shall be treated as specifically attributable to the Members
and shall be allocated among the Members such that the burden of (or any diminution in distributable proceeds resulting from) any
such amounts is borne by those Members to whom such amounts are specifically attributable (whether as a result of their status,
actions, inactions or otherwise, including pursuant to an allocation made under <U>Section&nbsp;10.4(c)</U>), in each case as reasonably
determined by the Company Representative.</FONT></P>

attributable to the Tax Attributes, determined using a &ldquo;with and without&rdquo; methodology. Carryovers or carrybacks of

governing the use, limitation and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant type. If a carryover or carryback of any

Every time the Corporate Taxpayer delivers to a TRA Party an applicable Schedule under this TRA Agreement, including any Amended
Schedule delivered pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.3(b), and any Early Termination Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall also (x)&nbsp;deliver to such TRA Party supporting schedules and work papers, as determined by the Corporate
Taxpayer or as reasonably requested by such TRA Party, providing reasonable detail regarding data and calculations that were relevant
for purposes of preparing the Schedule, (y)&nbsp;indicate which Advisory Firm prepared the Schedule and, upon the written request
of the TRA Party Representative, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Advisory Firm to prepare an Advisory Firm Letter
with respect to such Schedule, and (z)&nbsp;allow the TRA Party Representative and its advisors reasonable access to the appropriate
representatives at the Corporate Taxpayer and (at the cost and expense of OpCo) at the Advisory Firm that prepared the applicable
Schedule in connection with a review of such Schedule. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall ensure that any Tax Benefit Schedule or Early Termination Schedule that is delivered to a TRA Party, along with
any supporting schedules and work papers, provides a reasonably detailed presentation of the calculation of the Actual Tax Liability
(the &ldquo;with&rdquo; calculation) and the Hypothetical Tax Liability (the &ldquo;without&rdquo; calculation) and identifies
any material assumptions or operating procedures or principles that were used for purposes of such calculations. An applicable
Schedule or amendment thereto shall become final and binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days from the date on which all
relevant TRA Parties have been given the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto under Section&nbsp;7.1 unless the TRA Party Representative
(i)&nbsp;within thirty (30) calendar days after having been given the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto, gives the Corporate
Taxpayer written notice of a material objection to such Schedule or amendment thereto made in good faith (&ldquo;<B><U>Objection
Notice</U></B>&rdquo;), or (ii)&nbsp;provides a written waiver of its right to give an Objection Notice within the period described
in clause (i)&nbsp;above, in which case such Schedule or amendment thereto becomes binding on the date such waiver is given by
the TRA Party Representative and received by the Corporate Taxpayer. If the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative,
for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in the Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after
the TRA Party Representative gives the Corporate Taxpayer an Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative
shall employ the reconciliation procedures described in Section&nbsp;7.9 (the &ldquo;<B><U>Reconciliation Procedures</U></B>&rdquo;),
in which case such Schedule or Amended Schedule becomes binding in accordance with Section&nbsp;7.9. The TRA Party Representative
will represent the interests of each of the TRA Parties and shall raise and pursue, in accordance with this Section&nbsp;2.3(a),
any objection to a Schedule or amendment thereto timely given in writing to the TRA Party Representative by a TRA Party.</FONT></P>

connection with a Determination affecting such Schedule, (ii)&nbsp;to correct material inaccuracies in the Schedule, including
those identified as a result of the receipt of additional factual information relating to a Taxable Year after the date the Schedule
was provided to a TRA Party, (iii)&nbsp;to comply with an Expert&rsquo;s determination under the Reconciliation Procedures, (iv)&nbsp;to
reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit, or the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to a carryback or
carryforward of a loss or other Tax item to such Taxable Year, (v)&nbsp;to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or the

Schedule, an &ldquo;<B><U>Amended Schedule</U></B>&rdquo;). The Corporate Taxpayer shall provide an Amended Schedule to each TRA
Party when the Corporate Taxpayer delivers the Basis Schedule for the following Taxable Year. In the event a Schedule is amended
after such Schedule becomes final pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.3(a)&nbsp;or, if applicable, Section&nbsp;7.9, (A)&nbsp;the Amended
Schedule shall not be taken into account in calculating any Tax Benefit Payment in the Taxable Year to which the amendment relates

In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative are unable to resolve a disagreement with respect to
the calculation of amounts owed pursuant to Sections 2.3, 4.1 and 4.2 within the relevant period designated in this TRA Agreement
(&ldquo;Reconciliation Dispute&rdquo;), the Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted for determination to a nationally recognized
expert in the particular area of disagreement, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator (the &ldquo;Expert&rdquo;), mutually
acceptable to the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative. The Expert shall be a partner or principal of PricewaterhouseCoopers,
Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young, Deloitte, KPMG, BDO USA, LLP, Grant Thornton LLP, Alvarez&nbsp;&amp; Marsal, or RSM US LLP, and unless
the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative agree in writing otherwise, the Expert shall not, and the firm that employs
the Expert shall not, have any material relationship with any party to this TRA Agreement, any Affiliate of any such parties,
any member of the Rice Family, or any Affiliate of any such member or any other actual or potential conflict of interest. If the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative are unable to agree on an Expert within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt
by the respondent(s)&nbsp;of written notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, then the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative
shall cause the Expert to be selected by the International Chamber of Commerce Centre for Expertise (the &ldquo;ICC&rdquo;) in
accordance with the criteria set forth above in this Section&nbsp;7.9. The Expert shall resolve any matter relating to the Basis
Schedule or an amendment thereto or the Early Termination Schedule or an amendment thereto within thirty (30) calendar days and
shall resolve any matter relating to a Tax Benefit Schedule or an amendment thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days or, in each
case, as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each case after the matter has been submitted to the Expert for resolution.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment that is the subject of a disagreement
would be due (in the absence of such disagreement) or any Tax Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is due, the undisputed
amount shall be paid on the date prescribed by this TRA Agreement and such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by the Corporate
Taxpayer, subject to adjustment or amendment upon resolution.&nbsp; The sum of (a)&nbsp;the costs and expenses relating to (i)&nbsp;the
engagement (and, if applicable, selection by the ICC) of such Expert and (ii)&nbsp;if applicable, amending any Tax Return in connection
with the decision of such Expert and (b)&nbsp;the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Corporate Taxpayer and the
TRA Party Representative incurred in the conduct of such proceeding shall be allocated between the Corporate Taxpayer, on the
one hand, and the TRA Party Representative (on behalf of the TRA Parties), on the other hand, in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Expert that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the Expert) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so submitted, and each such party shall promptly reimburse
the other party for the excess that such other party has paid in respect of such costs and expenses over the amount it has been
so allocated. The Corporate Taxpayer may withhold payments under this TRA Agreement to collect amounts due under the preceding
sentence. Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning of this Section&nbsp;7.9 shall be
decided by the Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute and the determinations of the Expert pursuant
to this Section&nbsp;7.9 shall be binding on the Corporate Taxpayer and each of the TRA Parties and may be entered and enforced
in any court having jurisdiction.</FONT></P>

reason of such TRA Party&rsquo;s failure to comply with the last sentence of this Section&nbsp;7.10) are required under applicable
law and in obtaining any available exemption or reduction of, or otherwise minimizing to the extent permitted by applicable law,

the Corporate Taxpayer, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this TRA Agreement as having been paid to the
