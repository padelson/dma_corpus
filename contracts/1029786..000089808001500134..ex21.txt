pursuant to Section 807-A of the Pennsylvania Insurance Company Law of 1921,

forth in the PBCL and the Insurance Code. Pursuant to the Merger and the Plan
of Conversion, (a) the Articles of Incorporation of the Company as in effect

Incorporation") and immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended as provided by law and by the terms of such Articles of
Incorporation, and (b) the Bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately
following the Conversion and immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided
by law and by the terms of such Bylaws and the Articles of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.2. Closing. The closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place (a) at the offices of Debevoise and Plimpton,

the fifth Trading Day after the day on which the last to be fulfilled or

or waived in accordance with this Agreement, or (b) at such other place and
time and/or on such other date as the Company and Sponsor may agree in
writing (such date, the "Closing Date").   Section 1.3. Effective Time of
the Merger. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub, as
required, will deliver for filing to the office of the Secretary of the

effective (the "Effective Time").   Section 1.4. Directors and Officers of
the Surviving Corporation. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Merger shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and the
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Merger shall be the officers
of the Surviving Corporation. The directors and officers of the Surviving

DEMUTUALIZATION; MEMBER APPROVAL   Section 2.1. Plan of Conversion.   (a)
As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall prepare
and adopt the Plan of Conversion, which shall implement the terms set forth
in Article III and the terms set forth on Exhibit C (the "Conversion
Term Sheet"). The Company shall file the Plan of Conversion with the
Insurance Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Insurance
Commissioner") in accordance with the Insurance Company Mutual-to-Stock
Conversion Act as codified in the Insurance Code (the "Conversion Statute").
Following such filing, the Company shall take such additional actions,
consistent with the Conversion Term Sheet, as may be required under the
Conversion Statute to complete its demutualization pursuant to the provisions
hereof and the Plan of Conversion. The Plan of Conversion may contain such
additional terms not set forth in the Conversion Term Sheet or modifications
to terms set forth in the Conversion Term Sheet as the Company may determine;
provided, however, that any such additional term or modification that (i) is
materially inconsistent with any material term set forth in the Conversion
Term Sheet in a manner that adversely affects the economic value to Sponsor
of the Merger, or (ii) would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, shall require the prior written consent of Sponsor;
and provided, further, that the consent of Sponsor shall not be required for
any modification or additional term (x) the impact of which is addressed by
the formula set forth in Section 3.1(b) (other than the terms set forth in
Sections 9(a)(iii), 9(a)(iv), 9(a)(v) and 9(a)(vi) of the Conversion Term
Sheet) or (y) which affects the amount of cash and Policy Credits to be paid
by the Company pursuant to Section 3.6(a).   (b) The Company shall consult
with and inform Sponsor from time to time concerning developments relating to
the Plan of Conversion and shall permit Sponsor and its representatives to
participate in all aspects of the preparation and implementation of the Plan
(including without limitation by permitting Sponsor to review and comment on
all documents to be filed with or delivered to any Governmental Entity or
otherwise to be used in connection with the Plan); provided, however, that
representatives of Sponsor shall not have a right to attend or participate in
any meeting, conference or similar event with a Government Entity regarding
any Superior Proposal or any Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors
of the Company in good faith believes is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal. Each party shall provide the other party with reasonable
advance notice of any such hearing, proceeding, meeting, conference or
similar event. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
2.1(b), nothing herein is intended to supersede the provisions set forth in
Section 7.2 hereof.   (c) Each of the Company and Sponsor shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Plan of Conversion to become effective
prior to December 31, 2002 in accordance with its terms and the provisions of
the Conversion Statute.   (d) In the event that the Plan of Conversion or
the Merger cannot be consummated in accordance with the transaction structure
for the Merger provided for in this Agreement, despite the parties\' exercise
of their reasonable best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and opinions
of counsel as provided in this Agreement, the parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to consummate the acquisition of the Company by
Sponsor using a different structure that is reasonably acceptable to both the
Company and Sponsor, substantially preserves for the parties the economic and
other material benefits of the Merger and satisfies all other conditions to
closing set forth in Article VIII hereof.   Section 2.2. No-Action Letter;
Information Statement; Registration Statement.   (a) No-Action Letter. As
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Sponsor shall prepare a letter
to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") requesting
a letter (the "No-Action Letter") from the SEC staff taking a "no-action"
position with respect to Sponsor\'s not registering the offer and sale of the
shares of Sponsor Common Stock to be issued in the Merger under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Company and
Sponsor shall consult with each other with respect to such request and shall
cooperate to file such request with the SEC staff as promptly as practicable.
The Company and Sponsor, after consultation with each other, shall respond as
promptly as practicable to any questions or comments made by the SEC.   (b)
Information Statement. As promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Company and Sponsor shall, in connection with the solicitation
of approval and adoption by the Members of the Plan of Conversion and the
amendments to the Articles of Incorporation described in Section 2.2(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Articles Amendments"), prepare
an information statement relating to the Plan of Conversion, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and use reasonable
best efforts to obtain and furnish the information required to be included by
state and federal law, including the Insurance Code, and to submit the
information statement to the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance (the
"Department"). Such information statement shall also constitute an offering
memorandum (or prospectus as described in Section 2.2(c), if applicable) of
Sponsor with respect to the shares of Sponsor Common Stock (the "Sponsor
Shares") to be issued in the Merger (such information statement and offering
memorandum (or prospectus, as described in Section 2.2(c), if applicable) are
referred to herein as the "Information Statement").   (c) Registration
Statement. If the SEC staff has not issued the No-Action Letter within 120
days after the date of this Agreement, Sponsor shall, after providing the
Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment, promptly file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration
Statement") for the purpose of registering the Sponsor Shares under the
Securities Act and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain and furnish
the information required to be included by the SEC in the
Registration Statement, which shall include the Information Statement. The
Company shall furnish Sponsor with all information concerning the Company and
shall take such other action as Sponsor may reasonably request in connection
with such Registration Statement and the issuance of the Sponsor Shares.
Sponsor, after consultation with the Company, shall respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Registration
Statement (copies of which Sponsor shall provide to the Company), and shall
use reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective by the SEC.   (d) Further Actions. Sponsor shall take any
reasonable action required to be taken under applicable securities laws in
connection with the issuance of the Sponsor Shares, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the Members as may be
reasonably requested by Sponsor in connection with such action.   Section
2.3. Special Meeting of Members. The Company, acting through its Board of
Directors and subject to Section 7.3, shall duly call, send notice
of, convene and hold a special meeting of its Members (the "Company
Special Meeting"), as soon as practicable after the later of (a) the date of
the approval by the Insurance Commissioner of the Plan of Conversion, and (b)
either (i) the date of the receipt by Sponsor and the Company of the No-
Action Letter or (ii) the date upon which the Registration Statement is
declared effective, whichever is applicable, for the purpose of voting upon
the approval and adoption of the Plan of Conversion (which will provide for
the Merger) and the Articles Amendments. The Company shall mail the
Information Statement to its Members and, subject to Section 7.3, shall
include in the Information Statement the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company that Members vote in favor of the approval and
adoption of the Plan of Conversion and the Articles Amendments.   Section
2.4. Sponsor Information Statement. As soon as is reasonably practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, (i) Sponsor shall deliver to the
Company a written consent of stockholders of Sponsor duly executed
by Nationwide Corporation approving the issuance of the Sponsor Shares
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Sponsor
Stockholder Consent") and (ii) Sponsor shall prepare and, after providing the
Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment, file with the
SEC an information statement under the Exchange Act with respect to the
notification of the Sponsor stockholders of the execution of the Sponsor
Stockholder Consent approving the issuance of the Sponsor Shares (the
"Sponsor Information Statement") and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond, after consultation with the Company, to any comments of the SEC
(copies of which Sponsor shall provide to the Company) as promptly as
practicable after such filing. Sponsor will cause the Sponsor Information
Statement to be mailed to all stockholders of Sponsor, at the earliest
practicable time after the expiration of the period of time prescribed by
Rule 14c-5 of the Exchange Act (or such extended time period as requested by
SEC staff) or if comments are received by the SEC prior to the expiration of
such period of time, upon receipt of written notice from the SEC advising
Sponsor of the SEC\'s permission to file the Sponsor Information Statement in
definitive form. The Company shall furnish all information concerning the
Company and shall take such other actions as Sponsor may reasonably request
in connection with the filing of the Sponsor Information Statement.  
Section 2.5. No False or Misleading Statements.   (a) Each of Sponsor and
the Company agrees that the information provided and to be provided by
Sponsor or the Company, as the case may be, specifically for use in the
Registration Statement (if applicable), the Information Statement and the
Sponsor Information Statement, shall not, with respect to the information
supplied by such party:   (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, on
the date the  Registration Statement becomes effective;   (ii) in the case
of the Information Statement, on the date upon which  the Information
Statement is mailed to the Members of the Company or on the  date upon which
the approval and adoption of the Plan of Conversion and the  Articles
Amendments by the Members of the Company is obtained; and   (iii) in the
case of the Sponsor Information Statement, on the date  upon which the
Sponsor Information Statement is mailed to stockholders of 
Sponsor,  contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.   (b) If at any time prior to the applicable dates
referred to in Section 2.5(a), any information relating to Sponsor or the
Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is
discovered by Sponsor or the Company which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Information Statement, the Registration
Statement or the Sponsor Information Statement so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and, to the
extent required by Applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly prepared and, if applicable,
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company\'s Members or stockholders
of Sponsor, as the case may be.   ARTICLE III   CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF
SECURITIES   Section 3.1. Aggregate Consideration.   (a) The aggregate
consideration to be paid to Eligible Policyholders in the Conversion and the
Merger is $1.555 billion (the "Initial Aggregate Consideration"), subject to
adjustment in accordance with this Section 3.1 (the Initial Aggregate
Consideration, as adjusted in accordance with Section 3.1(b), the "Final
Aggregate Consideration").   (b) The Final Aggregate Consideration shall be
calculated pursuant to the following formula:   A = ...B + 0.6 x ((C - D) -
((E - F) x G))  where   A = Final Aggregate Consideration   B = $1.555
billion   C = excess of the amount of liabilities allocated to the Closed 
Block over the amount of assets allocated to the Closed Block  (the "Closed
Block Funding Deficit"), as of December 31, 2000,  as set forth in the
analysis of Milliman USA supporting the  establishment of the Closed Block
(the "Milliman Analysis"),  where the amount of such liabilities and assets
are determined  in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or 
permitted by the Department ("Pennsylvania Statutory  Accounting Practices")
and have been agreed by the Department  and where such assets include,
without limitation, cash,  invested assets, accrued investment income, net
due and  deferred premiums and policy loans   D = $461.9 million   E =
the annual effective yield, gross of investment expenses and  expected
defaults, expressed in basis points, of the invested  assets (excluding
policy loans) allocated to the Closed Block,  as of the date of its
establishment, as set forth in the  Milliman Analysis, where the denominator
used in determining  such yield is the carrying value of such invested assets
as of  such date determined in accordance with Pennsylvania Statutory 
Accounting Practices   F = 815   G = $1.36 million   (c) The Plan of
Conversion shall provide for the allocation (but not necessarily the
issuance) among all Eligible Policyholders of shares of common stock of the
Company, as converted, par value $0.01 per share (each, a "Company Share").
The aggregate number of Company Shares to be allocated among all Eligible
Policyholders (the "Aggregate Allocable Company Shares") shall be determined
as follows:   (i) if the Sponsor Final Stock Price is equal to or greater
than 115%  of the Sponsor Initial Stock Price, the Aggregate Allocable
Company Shares  shall equal the number determined by dividing (1) the Final
Aggregate  Consideration by (2) 1.125 times the Sponsor Initial Stock
Price;   (ii) if the Sponsor Final Stock Price is equal to or greater than
110%  of the Sponsor Initial Stock Price but less than 115% of the Sponsor 
Initial Stock Price, the Aggregate Allocable Company Shares shall equal the 
number determined by dividing (1) the Final Aggregate Consideration by (2) 
the average of (A) the Sponsor Final Stock Price and (B) 110% of the  Sponsor
Initial Stock Price;   (iii) if the Sponsor Final Stock Price is greater
than 85% of the  Sponsor Initial Stock Price but less than 110% of the
Sponsor Initial Stock  Price, the Aggregate Allocable Company Shares shall
equal the number  determined by dividing (1) the Final Aggregate
Consideration by (2) the  Sponsor Final Stock Price; and   (iv) if the
Sponsor Final Stock Price is equal to or less than 85% of  the Sponsor
Initial Stock Price, the Aggregate Allocable Company Shares  shall equal the
number determined by dividing (1) the Final Aggregate  Consideration by (2)
0.85 times the Sponsor Initial Stock Price.  For the purposes of this
Section 3.1(c), "Sponsor Final Stock Price" means the volume weighted average
of the sale prices of the Sponsor Common Stock as published by Bloomberg
Professional Service for the 15 consecutive Trading Days ending on the fifth
Trading Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and "Sponsor Initial
Stock Price" is equal to $43.37, which represents the volume weighted average
of the sale prices of the Sponsor Common Stock as published by Bloomberg
Professional Service for the 15 consecutive Trading Days ending on
the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, as adjusted
in accordance with Section 3.1(e).   (d) The aggregate allocation to each
Eligible Policyholder in respect of all eligible policies or contracts held
by such Eligible Policyholder shall be rounded to the nearest whole number of
shares (with one-half of a share being rounded upwards).   (e) If between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Sponsor Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares, by reason
of a reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of
shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities is declared with
regard to the Sponsor Common Stock with a record date between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Sponsor Initial Stock Price will
be adjusted to such number as if the reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange or dividend had occurred prior to the 16th
Trading Day immediately preceding the date of this Agreement.   Section 3.2.
Conversion of Membership Interests. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
all Membership Interests shall be extinguished in the Conversion, and,
pursuant to the Plan of Conversion, the consideration to be paid in the
Conversion to each Eligible Policyholder in exchange for its Membership
Interests shall be Company Shares, cash or Policy Credits determined as
follows:   (a) Eligible Policyholders who hold policies or contracts
whose tax-advantaged status would be jeopardized by the distribution of
Sponsor Shares or cash in the Merger in respect of such policies or contracts
("Tax Advantaged Policies") shall, pursuant to the Plan of Conversion,
receive Policy Credits in lieu of Company Shares allocated to them in respect
of such Tax Advantaged Policies, the value of such Policy Credits to equal
the number of such Company Shares multiplied by the Sponsor Final Stock
Price;   (b) Eligible Policyholders who hold Mandatory Cash Policies shall,
pursuant to the Plan of Conversion, receive cash in lieu of Company Shares
allocated to them in respect of such Mandatory Cash Policies, the amount of
such cash to equal the number of such Company Shares multiplied by the
Sponsor Final Stock Price; and   (c) the Company shall issue to the
Eligible Policyholders who hold policies or contracts that are not Tax
Advantaged Policies or Mandatory Cash Policies the Company Shares allocated
to them in respect of such policies or contracts (each Company Share so
issued, an "Issued Company Share", the aggregate number of such Issued
Company Shares, the "Aggregate Issued Company Shares", and each such Eligible
Policyholder, an "Eligible Shareholder"). The Aggregate Issued Company Shares
shall be evidenced by a single global certificate delivered to the Conversion
Agent, registered in the name of the Conversion Agent, as agent for the
Eligible Shareholders (the "Company Share Certificate").   Section 3.3.
Approval and Adoption of the Plan of Merger. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Conversion Agent shall deliver to the Company
an instrument duly executed by it, as sole shareholder of record of the
Company, consenting, in lieu of a meeting of shareholders, to the adoption of
resolutions approving and adopting this Agreement.   Section 3.4. Exchange
of Company Shares for Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger:   (a) each Issued Company Share held for the account of an
Eligible Shareholder shall be converted into the right to receive either (A)
one Sponsor Share or (B) cash in an amount equal to the Sponsor Final Stock
Price (the "Cash Consideration", and together with the Sponsor Shares issued
in the Merger, the "Merger Consideration") as determined pursuant to Section
3.5 and, in accordance with and subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 3.6;   (b) the Conversion Agent shall deliver to the Company the
Company Share Certificate for cancellation;   (c) all Issued Company Shares
converted or exchanged into Merger Consideration will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to
exist;   (d) each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation; and   (e) except as otherwise provided under the PBCL, each
Eligible Shareholder will cease to have any rights as shareholders of the
Company, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each
Issued Company Share issued to it.   Section 3.5. Election Procedure. The
notice of the special meeting of members shall be accompanied by a form of
proxy and an election form (the "Election Form") on which an Eligible
Shareholder may request to receive, with respect to all (but not less than
all) of its Issued Company Shares, the Cash Consideration instead of Sponsor
Shares (a "Cash Election") pursuant to the Merger subject to and in
accordance with the following:   (a) If the amount available to be paid in
the form of cash and Policy Credits as determined under Section 3.6 is
inadequate, after the crediting of Policy Credits and payment of cash
pursuant to Section 3.2, to pay cash to all the Eligible Shareholders making
a Cash Election, the amount available shall be distributed to such Eligible
Shareholders in accordance with the number of Issued Company Shares owned by
such Eligible Shareholders, beginning with the Eligible Shareholders issued
the smallest number of Issued Company Shares and continuing to Eligible
Shareholders issued the largest number of Issued Company Shares at which Cash
Elections can be completely satisfied using such amount of available funds.
Eligible Shareholders who have made a Cash Election but are not entitled to
receive cash pursuant to the operation of the previous sentence shall receive
Sponsor Shares.   (b) Any Cash Election will only have been made properly if
the Conversion Agent receives the Election Form properly completed and signed
by 5:00 p.m. local time in the city in which the principal office of the
Conversion Agent is located, on the fifth Trading Day prior to the date of
the Company Special Meeting (or such other time and date as Sponsor and the
Company may agree) (the "Election Deadline").   (c) Any Eligible
Shareholder may revoke its Cash Election by written notice received by the
Conversion Agent at any time prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a
properly completed and signed, revised Election Form. All Cash Elections will
be revoked automatically if the Conversion Agent is notified in writing by
Sponsor or the Company that this Agreement has been terminated.   (d)
Sponsor will have reasonable discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in
part to the Conversion Agent, to determine whether any election or revocation
has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the
Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of Sponsor or the
Conversion Agent regarding such matters will be binding and conclusive.  
(e) All Issued Company Shares in respect of which a Cash Election is not made
by the Election Deadline or is made but cash may not be paid as a result
of the limitation set forth in Section 3.5(a), or in respect of which
the Conversion Agent determines a Cash Election has not been properly or
timely made, shall be exchanged in the Merger for Sponsor Shares.   (f)
Neither Sponsor nor the Conversion Agent will have any obligation to notify
any Person of any defect in an Election Form.   Section 3.6. Funding of and
Limitations on Policy Credits and Cash.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Sponsor shall make a capital contribution in cash to Merger Sub in an amount
equal to the excess of (x) the total amount of cash and Policy Credits that
are to be paid or credited in respect of Issued Company Shares or Membership
Interests, over (y) the total amount of cash and Policy Credits to be paid or
funded by the Company pursuant to the Plan of Conversion. Such amount to be
paid or funded by the Company, when added to the amount paid or payable by
the Company pursuant to Section 10.6, shall not exceed 10% of the sum of the
Total Consideration Value plus the amount paid or payable by the Company
pursuant to Section 10.6.   (b) The aggregate amount of cash and Policy
Credits that may be paid by or credited with funds supplied by Sponsor in
respect of Issued Company Shares or Membership Interests shall not exceed 20%
of the excess of (i) the Total Consideration Value over (ii) the aggregate
amount of cash and Policy Credits paid by or credited with funds supplied by
the Company in respect of Issued Company Shares or Membership Interests.  
(c) The number of Eligible Policyholders who may receive cash or
Policy Credits paid by or credited with funds supplied by Sponsor in respect
of Issued Company Shares or Membership Interests shall not exceed 20% of the
total number of Eligible Policyholders who receive cash, Sponsor Shares or
Policy Credits paid by or credited with funds (or Sponsor Shares) supplied by
Sponsor in respect of Issued Company Shares or Membership Interests, as the
case may be.   (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
the Plan of Conversion, the total amount of cash and Policy Credits that may
be paid or credited in respect of Issued Company Shares or Membership
Interests in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Plan of Conversion (and the portion of such total that may be paid or
credited with funds supplied by the Company or Sponsor) shall not exceed the
amounts necessary in order for special counsel to the Company and special
counsel to Sponsor to deliver the opinions required by Section 8.2(b) and
Section 8.3(b).   Section 3.7. Payment of Merger Consideration; Conversion
Agent.   (a) As soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and, in any event, not less than five days prior to the
mailing of the Information Statement to Members, Sponsor shall designate a
bank or trust company (or such other Person or Persons) reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as conversion agent (the "Conversion Agent") in
effecting the distribution of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger
and as a condition to such designation the Conversion Agent shall irrevocably
agree to deliver the consent as set forth in Section 3.3.   (b) As promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time, the Conversion Agent shall
distribute to each Eligible Shareholder the Merger Consideration applicable
to that Eligible Shareholder. No interest shall be paid or accrued on Merger
Consideration.   (c) As of the Effective Time, Sponsor and/or the Company,
as required, shall deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with the
Conversion Agent, for the benefit of the Eligible Shareholders the Sponsor
Shares and cash in an amount equal to the aggregate cash to be distributed
under this Article III, for distribution to such Eligible Shareholders in
accordance with this Article III and the Plan of Conversion.   (d) The cash
portion of the Merger Consideration shall be invested by the Conversion
Agent, as directed by and for the benefit of the Sponsor, provided that such
investments shall be limited to direct obligations of the United States of
America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States

by a commercial bank whose long-term debt obligations are rated at least A2
by Moody\'s or at least A by SandP;, in each case having a maturity not in
excess of one year or such other investments as the parties mutually agree.
Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
the Sponsor.   (e) The Conversion Agent, Sponsor and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Eligible Policyholder
such amounts as the Conversion Agent, Sponsor or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such
payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law, including, without limitation, back up withholding under
Section 3406 of the Code. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Eligible Policyholder
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   (f) As
promptly as practicable following the date that is six months after the
Effective Time, the Conversion Agent shall deliver to Sponsor all
cash, Sponsor Shares and other documents in its possession relating to
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and the Conversion Agent\'s
duties shall terminate. Thereafter and subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat and similar laws, each Eligible Shareholder that has not
yet received the Merger Consideration to which it is entitled to pursuant to
Section 3.4 may contact Sponsor and Sponsor shall pay to such Eligible
Shareholder the Merger Consideration to which it is entitled. None of
Sponsor, the Surviving Corporation or the Conversion Agent shall be liable to
any Person in respect of any such Sponsor Shares, cash or other funds
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  OF
SPONSOR AND MERGER SUB   Except as otherwise disclosed to the Company in a
letter (the "Sponsor Disclosure Letter") delivered to it by Sponsor and
Merger Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (either with specific
reference to the representations and warranties contained in this Article IV
to which the information in such letter relates or otherwise where it is
reasonably apparent to which representations and warranties such disclosure
is reasonably applicable), Sponsor and Merger Sub jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the Company, as follows:   Section 4.1.
Organization. Sponsor is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware with the corporate
power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with
the corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Each of Sponsor and Merger Sub is duly qualified as a
foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or held under lease
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified would not individually or in the
aggregate have or be reasonably likely to result in a Sponsor Material
Adverse Effect. The copies of Sponsor\'s and Merger Sub\'s respective
Constituent Documents which have been delivered to the Company are complete
and correct and in full force and effect.   Section 4.2. Capitalization.  
(a) As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of Sponsor
consists of 750,000,000 shares of Sponsor Common Stock, of which, as of
August 3, 2001, 24,126,755 shares are issued and outstanding, 750,000,000
shares of Sponsor Class B Common Stock of which 104,745,000 shares are issued

issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Sponsor
Common Stock and Sponsor Class B Common Stock are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except as set forth in
Section 4.2 of the Sponsor Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this
Agreement there are no shares of capital stock of Sponsor issued or
outstanding or any options, warrants, subscriptions, calls, rights,
convertible securities or other agreements or commitments obligating Sponsor
to issue, transfer, sell, redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire any shares
of its capital stock.   (b) The Board of Directors of Sponsor has duly
authorized and reserved 33,700,000 shares of Sponsor Common Stock for
issuance pursuant to the Merger. The Sponsor Shares, when issued in
accordance with this Agreement, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights with respect thereto.  
Section 4.3. Merger Sub and Sponsor Subsidiaries.   (a) The authorized

corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has the
corporate power and authority and all necessary government approvals to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good
standing or to have such power and authority or necessary governmental
approvals would not individually or in the aggregate have or be reasonably
likely to result in a Sponsor Material Adverse Effect. Each Sponsor Material
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business
in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not individually or in
the aggregate have or be reasonably likely to result in a Sponsor Material
Adverse Effect. Section 4.3(b) of the Sponsor Disclosure Letter sets forth
the name of each of the subsidiaries of Sponsor (the "Sponsor Subsidiaries")
that is as of the date hereof a significant subsidiary as such term is
defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act (the "Sponsor
Material Subsidiaries") and the state or jurisdiction of
its incorporation.   (c) Section 4.3(c) of the Sponsor Disclosure Letter
sets forth the name of each of the Sponsor Subsidiaries that is as of the
date hereof an insurance company (collectively, the "Sponsor Insurance
Subsidiaries"). Each of the Sponsor Insurance Subsidiaries is (i) duly
licensed or authorized as an insurance company in its jurisdiction of
incorporation and (ii) duly licensed or authorized to carry on an insurance
business in each other jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed or
authorized, except, in each case, where such failure to be licensed or
authorized would not individually or in the aggregate have or be reasonably
likely to result in a Sponsor Material Adverse Effect. Each of Sponsor and
the Sponsor Insurance Subsidiaries has made all required filings under
applicable insurance holding company statutes except where the failure to
file would not individually or in the aggregate have or be reasonably likely
to result in a Sponsor Material Adverse Effect.   (d) Sponsor is, directly
or indirectly, the record and beneficial owner of all of the outstanding
shares or other equity interests of Merger Sub and of each of the Sponsor
Material Subsidiaries, there are no proxies with respect to any such shares
or equity interests, and no equity securities of Merger Sub or of any Sponsor
Material Subsidiary are or may become required to be issued by reason of any
options, warrants, rights to subscribe to, calls or commitments of any
character whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, shares or other equity interests of
Merger Sub or of any Sponsor Material Subsidiary, and there are no
contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which Sponsor or
any Sponsor Material Subsidiary is or may be bound to issue, redeem, purchase
or sell additional shares or other equity interests of Merger Sub or of any
Sponsor Material Subsidiary or securities convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for any such shares or equity interests. All of such shares

delivered by each of Sponsor and Merger Sub and (assuming this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company) constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of each of Sponsor and Merger Sub, enforceable
against Sponsor and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms.   Section 4.5.

Sponsor and the Sponsor Insurance Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (c) any
occurrence or condition arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the public announcement thereof) which has had (or is reasonably
likely to result in) a Sponsor Material Adverse Effect, and Sponsor and the

respective filing dates, the Sponsor SEC Filings complied as to form, in all
material respects, with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and

reasonably likely to result in a Sponsor Material Adverse Effect, nor is
there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Government
Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Sponsor, Merger Sub or any of the
Sponsor Subsidiaries which would individually or in the aggregate have or be
reasonably likely to result in a Sponsor Material Adverse Effect.   Section

amounts reflected on or reserved against in Sponsor\'s consolidated balance
sheet of June 30, 2001 included in the Sponsor Financial Statements, (b)
liabilities and obligations not required by U.S. GAAP to be reflected in such
consolidated balance sheet (other than any such liabilities and obligations
which were not reflected or reserved against because they were contingent at
June 30, 2001, but which would be reflected or reserved against in such a

longer contingent as of the date hereof), (c) liabilities and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice

the Sponsor Material Subsidiaries wherein an adverse determination or ruling
in any one such action or proceeding or in all such actions and proceedings
in the aggregate would have or are reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Sponsor Material Adverse Effect.   (c) There are
not any unresolved questions or claims regarding the Sponsor\'s or any
Sponsor Material Subsidiary\'s Tax liability that are reasonably likely,

contracts or insurance policies issued by the Sponsor or any Sponsor Material
Subsidiary fail to comply with the applicable requirements under the Code or
other applicable Tax law that are required to be met in order for the
beneficiary or owner thereof to receive Tax treatment that is no less
favorable than the Tax treatment that the issuer represented would be
received in any written material provided by the issuer to the owner, where
the failure to so comply would, individually or in the aggregate, have or
reasonably be expected to result in a Sponsor Material Adverse Effect.  
(e) "Taxes" shall mean all federal, state, local and foreign taxes, and other

owns, has valid leasehold interests in or valid contractual rights to use,
all of the assets, tangible and intangible, used by, or necessary for the

in a Sponsor Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.14. Insurance Practices;
Permit and Insurance Licenses.   (a) The business of Sponsor and each of the
Sponsor Material Subsidiaries is being conducted in compliance, in all
material respects, with all Applicable Laws, including all insurance laws,
ordinances, rules, regulations, decrees and orders of any Government Entity,
and all material notices, reports, documents and other information required
to be filed thereunder within the last three years were properly filed in all
material respects and were in compliance in all material respects with such

not, individually or in the aggregate, have or be reasonably likely to result
in a Sponsor Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Sponsor and the Sponsor
Insurance Subsidiaries have all permits and insurance licenses the use and
exercise of which are necessary for the conduct of its business as now
conducted, other than such permits and insurance licenses the absence of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or be reasonably
likely to result in Sponsor Material Adverse Effect. The business of Sponsor
and each of the Sponsor Insurance Subsidiaries has been and is
being conducted in compliance, in all material respects, with all such
permits and insurance licenses. All such permits and insurance licenses are

contracts or insurance policies issued by the Company or any Company Material
Subsidiary fail to comply with the applicable requirements under the Code
that are required to be met in order for the beneficiary or owner thereof to
receive Tax treatment that is no less favorable than the Tax treatment that
the issuer represented would be received in any written material provided by
the issuer to the owner, where the failure to so comply would, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 5.11. Title to Property. Each of the Company and

in a Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.12. Insurance Practices;
Permits and Insurance Licenses.   (a) Except as otherwise would not
individually or in the aggregate have or be reasonably likely to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, all policies, binders, slips, certificates,

(including all applications, supplements, endorsements, riders and ancillary

and all material notices, reports, documents and other information required
to be filed thereunder within the last three years were properly filed in all
material respects and were in compliance in all material respects with such

Company Insurance Subsidiaries have all permits and insurance licenses the
use and exercise of which are necessary for the conduct of their respective
business as now conducted, other than such permits and insurance licenses the

been and is being conducted in compliance, in all material respects, with all
such permits and insurance licenses. All such permits and insurance licenses
are in full force and effect, and there is no proceeding or, to the Best
Knowledge of the Company, investigation pending or, to the Best Knowledge of
the Company, threatened which would reasonably be expected to lead to the
revocation, amendment, failure to renew, limitation, suspension
or restriction of any such permit or insurance license.   (d) Except where
failure to do so would not individually or in the aggregate have or be
reasonably be likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, each

directives of insurance regulatory authorities, and market
conduct recommendations resulting from market conduct examinations of
insurance regulatory authorities in the respective jurisdictions in which

Company, none of SandP;, Moody\'s or Best\'s has announced that it has under
surveillance or review its rating of the financial strength or claims-paying
ability of the Company or any Company Insurance Subsidiary, and there exists
no reason (other than the public announcement of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby) why SandP;, Moody\'s or Best\'s would lower

"watch" list to determine whether to lower its rating.   Section 5.14.

(if any) forming a part thereof, has received a favorable determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service as to its qualification under the
Code and to the effect that each such trust is exempt from taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code, and nothing has occurred with respect to
such Plan since the date of such determination letter that could reasonably
be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d) No
material liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the Company

premiums have been paid when due).   (e) No ERISA Plan or any trust
established thereunder that is subject to Section 302 of ERISA and Section

have been timely made.   (f) Neither the Company, nor, to the Best Knowledge
of the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, has engaged in a transaction in

penalties under the excise tax or joint and several liability provisions of
the Code relating to employee benefit plans that would, individually, or
taken together with any amounts arising as a result of noncompliance with any
of the other paragraphs of this Section 5.19, have or be reasonably likely to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (g) To the Best Knowledge of
the Company, each Plan has been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law, including ERISA and
the Code, except where such noncompliance, individually, or taken together
with any amounts arising as a result of noncompliance with any of the other
paragraphs of this Section 5.19, would not have or be reasonably likely to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (h) The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (x) entitle any current
or former employee, director or officer of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement or (y) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any
such employee, director or officer.   (i) There are no pending or, to the
Best Knowledge of the Company, threatened or anticipated actions, suits or

under any Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits) that would, individually, or taken together with any
amounts arising as a result of noncompliance with any of the other paragraphs
of this Section 5.19, have or be reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (j) No Plan provides benefits, including death or
medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former
employees after retirement or other termination of service other than (i)
coverage mandated by Applicable Law, (ii) death benefits or retirement
benefits under any "employee pension plan," as that term is defined in

labor practice charge.   Section 5.21. Intellectual Property Rights.   (a)

or propose, any change in its Articles of Incorporation or Charter,
which changes would materially delay or impede the Merger;   (b) After the
date of the hearing (the "Hearing Date") on the Plan before the Insurance

material portion of the equity of any other Person, or (iii) (except in the
ordinary course of business) dispose of any assets or property which
are material to Sponsor and the Sponsor Subsidiaries taken as a whole, if
such merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition (1) could reasonably
be expected to have a material impact on the ability of Sponsor to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (2) could reasonably be
expected to result in a reduction in the insurer financial strength ratings
of the Sponsor Insurance Subsidiaries by any two of SandP;, Moody\'s and
Best\'s below the then current corresponding insurer financial strength
ratings of the Company and the Company Insurance Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sponsor shall not enter into any agreement to
consummate any merger, consolidation, acquisition or disposition, if the
announcement of such agreement or the consummation of such merger,
consolidation, acquisition or disposition would be required to be reported by
Sponsor on a Current Report on Form 8-K at any time during the period
beginning on the 30th calendar day prior to the date of the Company Special

Sponsor Subsidiary to, take any action that is not explicitly permitted by
this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in a reduction of

insurer financial strength ratings of the Company and the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries;   (f) Sponsor shall not issue any capital stock (other than
pursuant to employee benefits plan or the exercise of employee stock options)
or register any shares of its capital stock for sale, either through a
primary or a secondary offering of such shares, unless (x) after giving
effect to such issuance or sale and to the issuance of Class A Common Stock
in the Merger, Nationwide Corporation will continue to own beneficially at
least such number of shares of capital stock as is necessary to exercise a
majority of the voting power at any meeting, and in any action by written
consent, of the stockholders of Sponsor and (y) the closing of any such
issuance or sale shall occur prior to the period beginning on the 30th
calendar day prior to the date of the Company Special Meeting.   (g)
Sponsor shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub or any Sponsor Subsidiary
to, agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.   ARTICLE VII   ADDITIONAL
AGREEMENTS   Section 7.1. Access and Information. The Company and Sponsor
shall each afford to the other and to the other\'s financial advisors, legal
counsel, accountants, consultants, financing sources, and other
authorized representatives access during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time to all of its books, records, properties,
plants and personnel and, during such period, each shall furnish as promptly
as practicable to the other (a) a copy of each report, schedule and other
document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws, and (b) all other information as such other party reasonably
may request, provided that neither party shall disclose to the other any
competitively sensitive information and no investigation pursuant to this
Section 7.1 shall affect any representations or warranties made herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the respective parties to consummate the
Merger. The Company and Sponsor agree to schedule and convene meetings of
officers, producers and employees at reasonable intervals to discuss Company
and Sponsor business developments, status of efforts related to the closing
of the Merger and other matters of mutual interest. Each party shall continue
to abide by the terms of the two confidentiality agreements between Sponsor
and the Company, dated May 8, 2001 and July 10, 2001, (the "Confidentiality
Agreements").   Section 7.2. Acquisition Proposals. The Company shall not,
nor shall it permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or
permit any officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of, the Company or
any of its subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or
encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or (b) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information with respect to, or agree to or endorse, or take any other action
to facilitate any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this
Section 7.2 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any person or entity that makes an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
if, (A) the Board of Directors of the Company received the Acquisition
Proposal prior to the expiration of 45 days following the date on which a
copy of this Agreement is made publicly available, (B) the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law and (C) prior to taking such action,
the Company (x) provides reasonable notice to Sponsor to the effect that it
is taking such action and (y) receives from such person or entity an executed
confidentiality agreement having terms no less favorable (in the aggregate
and except as to standstill provisions) to the Company, than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 8, 2001, between the Company and
Sponsor. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company shall as promptly as practicable advise Sponsor orally and in writing
of the receipt by it (or any of the other entities or persons referred to
above) after the date hereof of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry
which could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and
the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.
The Company will keep Sponsor fully informed of the status and details of any
such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The term "Acquisition Proposal" as used
herein means any proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business
combination involving the Company or any of the Company Material
Subsidiaries, any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner a substantial
equity interest in, or a substantial portion of the business or assets of,
the Company or any of the Company Material Subsidiaries (provided
any transaction permitted under Section 6.1(c) shall not be deemed to be
an Acquisition Proposal), any proposal or offer with respect to
any recapitalization or restructuring of the Company or any of the Company
Material Subsidiaries, or any proposal or offer with respect to any other
transaction similar to any of the foregoing with respect to the Company or
any of the Company Material Subsidiaries, other than the Merger contemplated
by this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Conversion Term
Sheet and the Post-Merger Integration Plan. Immediately after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will cease and terminate any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal.   Section
7.3. Fiduciary Duties. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not (a)
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Sponsor or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by such Board of
Directors of this Agreement or the Merger, (b) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or (c) enter
into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, unless the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal and (i) the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company provides at least two Business Days\'
notice to Sponsor of its intention to do so and, if requested by Sponsor,
negotiates in good faith with Sponsor regarding any proposed amendments to
this Agreement offered by Sponsor during this period, and after taking into
account such proposed amendments, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal continues to be a
Superior Proposal, and (iii) the Company enters into an agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal prior to the expiration of 60 days
following the date on which a copy of this Agreement is made
publicly available. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, any action by the Board of Directors permitted by this Section
7.3 shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Company. The term
"Superior Proposal" as used herein means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal
made by any third party that the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in
good faith (x) following consultation with its independent financial
advisers, is more favorable to the Company (including consideration of its
constituencies and other pertinent factors) than the Merger, (y) has
commitments for any necessary financing (or for which, in the good faith
judgment of the Company\'s Board of Directors, following consultation with
its independent financial advisers, any necessary financing is reasonably
capable of being obtained by such third party), and (z) constitutes a
transaction that is reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms set
forth in the proposal, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal.   Section 7.4. Filings; Other Action.  
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, as promptly
as practicable, the Company, Sponsor and Merger Sub shall: (i) make all
filings and submissions under the HSR Act and ERISA and all filings required
by the insurance regulatory authorities in Pennsylvania, Delaware and any
other relevant jurisdiction, and deliver notices and consents to jurisdiction
to state insurance departments, each as reasonably may be required to be made
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A)
determining which filings are required to be made prior to the Effective Time
with, and which material consents, approvals, permits, notices or
authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time from,
Government Entities of the United States, the several states or the District
of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and foreign jurisdictions in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and related
agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and (B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such
consents, approvals, permits, notices or authorizations, and (iii) use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other action and
do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable. In connection with the foregoing, the Company will provide
Sponsor, and Sponsor will provide the Company, with copies of material
correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between such party or any of its representatives, on the
one hand, and any Government Entity or members of their respective staffs, on
the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or related agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.   (b) Sponsor will cooperate
with the Company with respect to all matters coming before the Department in
connection with this Agreement, the Plan of Conversion and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.   Section 7.5. Public Announcements; Public
Disclosures; Privacy Laws.   (a) Until the Effective Time, Sponsor, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree that they will not issue
any press release or otherwise make any public statement, make any public
filing or any submission to any rating agency or respond to any press inquiry
in each case with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior approval of the other party (which approval not to
be unreasonably withheld), except as may be required by Applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange.   (b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Sponsor shall file a copy of this Agreement with the SEC as an exhibit to a
Current Report on Form 8-K.   (c) Each of Sponsor and the Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the consummation of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the performance by the
parties of their obligations under this Agreement will not result in any
breach of (i) any Applicable Law concerning the protection of confidential
personal information received from individual policyholders or (ii) the
Company Privacy Policy or the privacy policy of Sponsor.   Section 7.6.
Stock Exchange Listing. Sponsor shall (i) as promptly as practicable prepare
and submit to the NYSE a listing application covering the Sponsor Shares to
be issued in connection with the Merger and this Agreement, and (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time, approval for
the listing of such Sponsor Shares on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance.   Section 7.7. Company Indemnification Provisions.   (a) Sponsor
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Company\'s existing
indemnification provisions as of the date hereof with respect to and to have
it perform in the same manner as the Company\'s existing
indemnification provisions with respect to present and former directors,
officers and employees of the Company and all other persons who may presently
serve or have served at the Company\'s request as a director, officer,
employee, member, fiduciary, trustee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture trust or other enterprise or association
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") for all losses, claims, damages,
expenses or liabilities arising out of actions or omissions or alleged
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the
extent permitted or required under Applicable Law and the
Company\'s Constituent Documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement
(to the extent consistent with Applicable Law), for a period of not less than
six years after the Effective Time.   (b) For a period of six years after
the Effective Time, Sponsor shall cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained
by the Company ("DandO; Insurance") with respect to claims arising from facts
or events which occurred before the Effective Time, provided that:   (i)
Sponsor may substitute therefor policies of at least the same  coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less  advantageous or
provide tail coverage for such persons covered by the DandO;  Insurance which
tail coverage shall provide coverage for a period of six  years after the
Effective Time for acts taken prior to the Effective Time  on terms no less
favorable than the terms of such current DandO; Insurance  coverage; and  
(ii) nothing contained herein shall require Sponsor or the Surviving 
Corporation to incur any annual premium in excess of 250% of the last  annual
estimated aggregate premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement  for all
current DandO; Insurance policies maintained by the Company, which the  Company
estimates to be $300,000 (the "Current Premium"), and if such  premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed 250% of the Current  Premium, then
Sponsor shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance  which, in
Sponsor\'s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage  available
at an annual premium equal to 250% of the Current Premium.   (c) If Sponsor,
Surviving Corporation or any of its or their successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Sponsor or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.7.   (d) The provisions of this
Section 7.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.   Section 7.8. Comfort Letters.   (a) Sponsor shall use
all reasonable best efforts to cause KPMG LLP, Sponsor\'s independent
auditors, to deliver to the Company a letter dated as of the date of the
Information Statement and addressed to the Company, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, in connection with the procedures
undertaken by them with respect to the financial statements and
other financial information of Sponsor contained in the Registration
Statement (if any) and the other matters contemplated by AICPA Statement No.
72 and customarily included in comfort letters relating to transactions
similar to the Merger.   (b) The Company shall use all reasonable best
efforts to cause PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, the Company\'s independent
auditors, to deliver to Sponsor a letter dated as of the date of the
Information Statement and addressed to Sponsor, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Sponsor, in connection with the procedures
undertaken by them with respect to the financial statements and other
financial information of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries contained
in the Registration Statement (if any) and the other matters contemplated by
AICPA Statement No. 72 and customarily included in comfort letters relating
to transactions similar to the Merger.   Section 7.9. Tax Matters. The
Company and Sponsor shall each reasonably cooperate in connection with
obtaining the opinions of special counsel described in Section 8.2(b) and
Section 8.3(b) including providing to special counsel such representations as
are reasonably required by special counsel to enable them to render such
opinions.   Section 7.10. Reorganization. The parties intend the Merger to
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code; each party and
its affiliates shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to
so qualify; neither party shall or shall permit any of its affiliates to take
any action that would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger not to so
qualify; and the parties will take the position for all purposes that the
Merger so qualifies.   Section 7.11. Additional Matters. Subject to the
terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using all reasonable
best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals in
connection with the Governmental Requirements and any other third party
consents and to effect all necessary registrations and filings. In case at
any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers
and/or directors of Sponsor, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such
necessary action.   Section 7.12. Continued Listing of Sponsor Common Stock.
Sponsor shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the listing of the
Sponsor Common Stock on the NYSE, and shall timely file all periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act.   Section 7.13. Employee Matters.   (a)
Until the Transition Date, Sponsor or the Surviving Corporation shall provide
each Employee continuously employed by Sponsor, Surviving Corporation or the
Company Subsidiaries since the Effective Time and each former employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries entitled as of the Effective
Time to receive continued compensation and/or benefits, for so long as they
are entitled thereto, with not less than the same basic compensation
(including base salary, wages or commission rates) and annual short term
incentive opportunity, to the extent applicable, as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed as limiting in any way the right of the
Sponsor, Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiaries to terminate the
employment of any Employee at any time after the Effective Time.   (b)
Until the Transition Date, Employees who were entitled to long-term incentive
opportunities immediately prior to the Effective Time and who have been
continuously employed by Sponsor, Surviving Corporation or the
Company Subsidiaries since the Effective Time, shall be entitled to receive
long-term incentive opportunities under equity-based or other long-term
incentive programs maintained by the Surviving Corporation or the Sponsor
which are not less than the long-term incentive opportunities to which such
Employees were entitled immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (c)
Sponsor shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, for all purposes (other
than the accrual of benefits) under any employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement of Sponsor or the Surviving Corporation as in effect from time
to time, the service and earnings with the Company or any Company Subsidiary
of each Employee who has been continuously employed by a Sponsor Affiliate
since the Effective Time to the same extent recognized under any comparable
plan or program maintained by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (d) On or before the Effective
Time, the Company may amend the Plans as contemplated by Section 7.13 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. From and after the Closing Date, Sponsor shall
cause such Plans to provide the applicable benefits to the current or former
employees of the Company, as the case may be, for the time periods so
specified in Section 7.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (e) For a
period of at least eighteen months following the Effective Time, any Employee
who has been continuously employed by a Sponsor Affiliate since the Effective
Time whose employment is involuntarily terminated (including any termination
of employment following a reduction in compensation or benefits or
a requested relocation to more than 25 miles from such employee\'s
current principal office (other than a transfer to or from the Company\'s
current offices in Berwyn, Pennsylvania or Newark, Delaware)) shall be
entitled to severance benefits equal to the greater of (i) the severance
benefits payable under the severance plan of the Sponsor for similarly
situated employees of the Sponsor or (ii) three weeks pay per year of
service, with a minimum of three months pay and a maximum of one year,
together with outplacement and career counseling through the applicable
severance period. In addition, the Sponsor or Surviving Corporation shall
also pay a portion of the monthly cost, if any, of continuation coverage
described in Section 602 of ERISA, equal to the monthly contribution of the
Sponsor or Surviving Corporation, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates,
for health care coverage for such Employee immediately prior to the
termination of such Employee\'s employment. Such payments shall continue for
a period equal to the lesser of (i) the period for which severance pay is
due, or (ii) the period for which such Employee elects to receive and
qualifies for such continuation coverage. The Employee shall be responsible
for paying any remaining cost of such continuation coverage, including the
full cost of such coverage for any remaining period for which coverage is
available after the severance payments terminate. In no event will any
severance benefit be paid for any termination where such termination is
the result in whole or in part of any disciplinary action with respect to
the Employee, a violation of company policy by the Employee, or other issue
related to the job performance of the Employee.   (f) From and after the
Effective Time, each Employee who has been continuously employed by a Sponsor
Affiliate since the Effective Time shall be entitled to the same number of
vacation days and holidays per year as such Employee was entitled to under
the policies of the Company or Company Subsidiaries in effect immediately
prior to the execution of this Agreement until such time as such Employee
would be entitled to a higher number of vacation days and holidays under the
policies of Sponsor and Surviving Corporation as in effect from time to time
following the Effective Time.   Section 7.14. Undertakings to the Insurance
Commissioner. Sponsor shall undertake in writing to the Insurance
Commissioner, in connection with the request for approval of the Insurance
Commissioner of the Plan of Conversion and the Merger, to perform its
obligations under Section 7.13.   Section 7.15. Approval of New Fund
Contracts. Sponsor and the Company recognize that the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute an assignment and termination
of the Client Contracts and the Underwriting Agreements under the terms
thereof and the Investment Company Act. Sponsor and the Company agree to use
all their reasonable best efforts to cooperate in obtaining such
authorizations and approvals of the Board of Directors or Trustee of the
Market Street Fund (including any separate approvals of
disinterested directors or trustees) and the shareholders thereof, as may be
reasonably required by the Investment Company Act for new contracts (the
"Fund Approvals"). Sponsor agrees to provide the Company such information,
for provision to the Board of Directors or Trustee of the Market Street Fund
or for inclusion in a proxy statement to the shareholders thereof, as may
reasonably be required.   Section 7.16. Non-Fund Consents. As promptly as
practicable after execution of this Agreement, the Company or a Company
Adviser Subsidiary shall cause all Non-Fund Clients, and any Non-Fund Client
in respect of all Client Contracts entered into by the Company or a Company
Adviser Subsidiary between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date
("New Clients"), to be informed of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In addition, the Company or a Company Adviser Subsidiary shall
request from all Non-Fund Clients, including all existing clients and New
Clients, a signed written consent to the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement in such form as may be reasonably satisfactory to Sponsor
("Affirmative Consent"). The Company or a Company Adviser Subsidiary may seek
the consent of a Non-Fund Client in the form of an implied consent ("Negative
Consent") by sending a notice and request-for-consent letter to each relevant
client not later than 60 days prior to the Closing in such form as may be
reasonably satisfactory to Sponsor. The Company shall (i) use reasonable best
efforts to keep Sponsor informed of the status of obtaining Affirmative
Consents and Negative Consents and (ii) deliver to Sponsor prior to the
Closing copies of all Affirmative Consents and make available for
inspection the originals of such Affirmative Consents prior to the
Closing.   Section 7.17. Information in Registered Fund Proxy Materials. The
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that each of the
proxy solicitation materials to be distributed to the shareholders of the
Market Street Fund in connection with the approvals required under the
Investment Company Act as described in Section 7.15 will provide all
information necessary in order to make the disclosure of information therein
satisfy the requirements of Section 14 of the Exchange Act, Section 20 of the
Investment Company Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and that
such materials (except to the extent supplied by Sponsor or any of its
officers) will be complete in all material respects and will not contain (at
the time such materials or information are distributed, filed or provided, as
the case may be and at the time of the applicable shareholder vote or action,
including any supplement thereto) any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading or necessary to correct any statement or any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of a proxy for the same
meeting or subject matter which has become false or misleading.   ARTICLE

which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:   1.
Representations and Warranties of Stockholder. Stockholder represents and
warrants to the Company that, as of the date hereof:   (a) Stockholder

rights and to general equity principles;   (d) The execution, delivery and
performance by Stockholder of this  Agreement will not (i) conflict with,
require a consent, waiver or approval  under, or result in a breach of or
default under, any provision of its  certificate or articles of incorporation
or by-laws or similar  organizational documents, or any of the terms of any
contract, indenture,  instrument, commitment or other obligation to which
Stockholder is a party  or by which Stockholder is bound; (ii) violate any
order, writ, injunction,  decree or statute, or any rule or regulation,

whatsoever  (collectively, "Encumbrances") upon the Shares; and   (e) Any
Shares held by Stockholder, or by a nominee or custodian for  the account of
Stockholder, during the term of this Agreement will at all  times be free and
clear of all Encumbrances with respect to the ownership,  transfer or voting

arrangements in the ordinary course which do not alter  the ability of
Stockholder to comply with the provisions of this Agreement  (the "Secured
Lending Arrangement"); and there are no outstanding options,  warrants or
rights to purchase or acquire, or other agreements relating to,  the Shares
other than this Agreement and the Intercompany Agreement, dated  as of March

with the execution and delivery of the Merger  Agreement, the Merger and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated  by the Merger Agreement.  
2. Stockholder Agreement to Vote Shares. At any meeting of the
stockholders of NFS at which the issuance of Class A Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of NFS in connection with the Merger is considered and at
every adjournment thereof, and in any other action by written consent of the
stockholders of NFS, Stockholder agrees to vote the Shares held by it and any
New Shares (as defined in Section 3 hereof) acquired by it or any entity
under its control, (a) in favor of adoption and approval of the issuance of
Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of NFS in connection with the
Merger and (b) against any action or proposal that would compete with or
could serve to materially interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely affect
or inhibit the timely consummation of the Merger. Any such vote shall be cast
or consent shall be given in accordance with such procedures relating thereto
as shall ensure that it is duly counted for purposes of determining that a
quorum is present and for purposes of recording the results of such vote or
consent. Stockholder also agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action, and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or advisable in order to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Stockholder agrees not to enter
into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any Person the effect
of which would be inconsistent with or violate the provisions and agreements
of this Section 2.   3. Additional Purchases. Stockholder agrees that in the
event (i) of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination or exchange of shares of capital stock of NFS
on, of or affecting the Shares, (ii) Stockholder purchases or otherwise
acquires beneficial ownership of any shares of capital stock of NFS after the
execution of this Agreement, or (iii) Stockholder voluntarily acquires the
right to vote or share in the voting of any shares of capital stock of NFS
other than the Shares (collectively, "New Shares"), such New Shares shall be
subject to the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as if they
constituted Shares.   4. Transfer and Encumbrance. Stockholder agrees that,
prior to the date this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with its
terms, it will not, without the prior written consent of the Company,
voluntarily transfer, sell, offer, pledge or otherwise dispose of (including
by way of merger or otherwise) or encumber ("Transfer"), except for
Encumbrances created pursuant to the Secured Lending Arrangements that do not
alter the ability of Stockholder to comply with the provisions of this
Agreement, any of the Shares or New Shares; provided, however, that
Stockholder may transfer ownership of any of the Shares or New Shares without
the consent of the Company (i) following the exercise by Stockholder of
registration rights with respect to the Shares pursuant to Article VII of the
Intercompany Agreement, provided that (x) such Transfer is made pursuant to a
firm commitment underwritten public offering, (y) after giving effect to such
Transfer and to Stockholder\'s reasonable estimate of the number of shares of
Class A Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, Stockholder will continue to
own beneficially at least such number of Shares or New Shares as is necessary
to exercise a majority of the voting power at any meeting, and in any action
by written consent, of the stockholders of NFS and (z) the closing of any
such Transfer shall not occur during the period beginning on the
30th calendar day prior to the date of the Company Special Meeting and
terminating on the Closing Date under the Merger Agreement, or (ii) to any
member of the Nationwide Affiliated Group if the transferee of such Shares or
New Shares shall, prior to such transfer, execute a counterpart to this
Agreement and shall have agreed to be bound by the terms of this Agreement,
including the obligation to vote such Shares or New Shares in accordance with
Section 2 hereof. The term "Nationwide Affiliated Group" shall mean, any of
Parent and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates now or
hereafter existing. Stockholder agrees not to enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with any Person the effect of which would be
inconsistent with or violate the provisions and agreements of this Section
4.   5. Specific Performance. The parties hereto severally agree that if
any party fails to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement,
that every such obligation is material and that, in the event of any such
failure, the other parties will be immediately and irreparably harmed and
will not have an adequate remedy at law or damages. In such event, each party
agrees that each other party shall have the right, in addition to any other
rights it may have, to specific performance of this Agreement. Accordingly,
if any party should institute an action or proceeding seeking specific
enforcement of the provisions hereof, the other parties hereby waive the
claim or defense that such party has an adequate remedy at law and hereby
agrees not to assert in any such action or proceeding the claim or defense
that such party has failed to show any or all of the elements necessary to
the granting of such relief. Each party further agrees to waive any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
obtaining any such equitable relief.   6. Binding Effect; Assignment. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their respective successors, permitted assigns and legal representatives.
Neither this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby, nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder or thereunder, may be
assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto and any
such assignment that is not consented to shall be null and void.   7.
Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other
agreements contemplated hereby, and the other documents referred to therein,
contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, written
or oral, with respect thereto.   8. Waivers and Amendments; Non-Contractual
Remedies; Preservation of Remedies. This Agreement may be amended,
superseded, canceled, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may be
waived, only by a written instrument signed by each of the parties or, in the
case of a waiver, by the party waiving compliance. No delay on the part of
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any
right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege, preclude any further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other such right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.   9.
Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT
TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.   10. Waiver of Jury Trial.
Each party to this Agreement waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.  
11. Interpretation. (a) The parties acknowledge and agree that they
may pursue judicial remedies at law or equity in the event of a dispute with

words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a  whole unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes,"  or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be  followed by the words "without
limitation." Whenever the singular is used  herein, the same shall include

be interpreted in favor of, or  against, either party hereto by reason of the
extent to which any such  party or its counsel participated in the drafting
thereof or by reason of  the extent to which any such provision is
inconsistent with any prior draft  hereof or thereof.   12. No Third Party
Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended and may not be construed to
create any rights in any parties other than the parties named herein and
their respective successors or assigns, and it is not the intention of the
parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person.  
13. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, the parties direct that such court interpret and apply
the remainder of this Agreement in the manner that it determines most
closely effectuates their intent in entering into this Agreement, and in
doing so particularly take into account the relative importance of the term,

understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the matters set
forth herein.   * * *        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties

C     Conversion Term Sheet   Capitalized terms used herein but not
defined herein shall have the respective meanings specified for such terms in
the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 7, 2001, by and among
Nationwide Financial Services, Inc., Eagle Acquisition Corporation, and
Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company (the "Agreement and Plan of
Merger").   1. Purpose of Conversion. The principal purpose of the
Conversion of the Company pursuant to the Plan of Conversion (the
"Conversion") is to convert the Company from a mutual life insurer to a stock
life insurer in order to enhance its strategic and financial flexibility and
make possible a distribution of value to Eligible Policyholders pursuant to
the Plan of Conversion and the Agreement and Plan of Merger.   2. Form of
Conversion. The Company shall be converted from a mutual life insurer into a
stock life insurer pursuant to a plan of conversion under
40 P.S.ss.917-A.   3. Merger.   (a) Immediately following the conversion
of the Company into a stock life insurer, Merger Sub, a Pennsylvania
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sponsor, will be merged with and
into the Company under the Insurance Code, with the Company as the surviving
corporation, which merger is intended to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (b) Immediately following the
Merger, all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company will be held by
Sponsor.   (c) Under the terms of the Plan of Conversion and the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, pursuant to the Conversion and the Merger, the Eligible
Policyholders will be entitled to receive Policy Credits or the Merger
Consideration, and the stock of the Merger Sub owned by Sponsor immediately
prior to the Merger will be converted into and become stock of the
Company.   4. Approval and Adoption of Plan.   (a) Adoption by the
Company. As soon as reasonably practicable, the Company shall adopt the Plan
of Conversion in compliance with 40 P.S.ss.917-A.   (b) Mailing of Notices
and Other Information. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Plan of
Conversion is adopted by the Company, the Company shall mail to Members
notices relating to the public hearing, if any, with respect to the Plan of
Conversion and the Company Special Meeting, which shall comply with the
applicable provisions of 40 P.S. ss.ss. 912-A to 929-A and regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto.   (c) Public Hearing. The Insurance
Commissioner may hold a public hearing as provided in 40 P.S.ss.ss.912-A to
929-A.   (d) Approval of Policyholders. A proposal to approve and adopt the
Plan of Conversion shall be submitted to a vote of the Members in compliance
with 40 P.S.ss.ss.912-A to 929-A and the PBCL.   (e) Filings. If the Plan
of Conversion and the Agreement and Plan of Merger are approved by the
Insurance Commissioner and if the Plan of Conversion is approved and adopted
by the Members, the Company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, submit
the appropriate documents and certifications to Governmental Entities to
cause the Conversion and Merger to take effect.   5. Effectiveness of
Plan.   (a) Plan Effective Date. The Plan Effective Date shall be the same
date as the date on which the Effective Time occurs, except that the
Conversion shall occur immediately before the Merger. The Company shall issue
the Issued Company Shares to the Conversion Agent, as record holder and
nominee for the Eligible Shareholders in the Conversion. The Plan of
Conversion shall provide that the Conversion Agent shall vote the Issued
Company Shares in favor of the approval and adoption of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger and that the Conversion Agent, as agent for Eligible
Shareholders, shall exchange such stock for Merger Consideration pursuant to
the Merger.   (b) The Conversion. On the Plan Effective Date:   (i) The
Company shall by operation of 40 P.S.ss.ss.912-A to 929-A  become a stock
insurer.   (ii) The Company\'s Articles of Incorporation and By-laws shall
be  amended and restated as set forth in exhibits to the Plan of
Conversion.   (iii) The Membership Interests shall be extinguished in
accordance  with 40 P.S. ss.ss. 912-A to 929-A and Eligible Policyholders
shall receive  the consideration set forth in Article III of the Agreement
and Plan of  Merger.   (iv) The Merger shall become effective.   6.
Eligible Policyholders. The Plan of Conversion shall specify a fair
and equitable method for determining the class of policyholders who shall
be considered Eligible Policyholders. Each Eligible Policyholder shall be
allocated a portion of the Aggregate Allocable Company Shares on a fair and
equitable basis as provided in the Plan of Conversion.   7. Payment of
Consideration Other than Shares. The Plan of Conversion will specify any
differences in the form and amount of consideration to be distributed to or
among Eligible Policyholders, consistent with the provisions of Article III
of the Agreement and Plan of Merger.   8. Allocation of Consideration. The
method or formula for the allocation of the consideration among the Eligible
Policyholders will be fair and equitable and will be consistent with the
following:   (a) The method or formula will follow the Actuarial Standard of
Practice entitled "Allocation of Policyholder Consideration in Mutual Life
Company Demutualizations".   (b) The method or formula will provide for
both a fixed component and a variable component for each Eligible
Policyholder (although the variable share for any particular Eligible
Policyholder may be zero).   (c) The variable component will be based on
historical and projected contributions to surplus and such other factors as
are consistent with such Actuarial Standard of Practice.   (d) Daniel J.
McCarthy, F.S.A., an actuary associated with Milliman USA, or other
nationally recognized actuary, will issue an opinion that the method
or formula for allocating consideration among the Eligible Policyholders, as
set forth in the Plan of Conversion, is fair and equitable.   9. Closed
Block.   (a) Establishment of Closed Block. The Company shall establish a
closed block of participating policies and contracts at reasonable funding
levels, consistent with the following:   (i) The Company will prepare a
written plan of operation for the  closed block consistent with the
requirements of the Conversion Statute and  the other applicable requirements
of the Insurance Code, and generally  consistent with the January 1999
Actuarial Standard of Practice entitled  "Actuarial Responsibilities with
Respect to Closed Blocks in Mutual Life  Insurance Company Conversions" (the
"Plan of Operation").   (ii) The assets allocated to the closed block,
together with the  revenue from the closed block, will be reasonably
sufficient for the  purposes specified in the Conversion Statute.   (iii)
The assets allocated to the closed block will have (1) an  average Macauley
duration of 6.0 to 7.25 years, (2) a credit quality  equivalent to the credit
quality of the assets assumed to be allocated to  the closed block in the
Actuarial Analysis of Eagle Mutual Life Insurance  Company as of December 31,
2000, dated April 30, 2001 and prepared by  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the
"PwC Report") and (3) a mix of asset types  equivalent to the mix of asset
types assumed to be allocated to the closed  block in the PwC Report.  
(iv) The closed block: (1) may include the classes of policies and  contracts
identified as closed block policies and contracts in the PwC  Report; (2) may
include classes of policies and contracts not identified as  closed block
policies and contracts in the PwC Report (the "Included  Policies"); and (3)
may exclude classes of policies and contracts  identified as closed block
policies and contracts in the PwC Report (the  "Excluded Policies");
provided, however, that upon establishment of the  closed block, the reserves
or premiums for either the Included Policies or  the Excluded Policies may
not exceed 5% of the reserves or premiums for all  policies and contracts
included in the closed block.   (v) The categories of expenses and taxes to
be charged against the  closed block shall be the same as the categories of
expenses and taxes  assumed to be charged against the closed block in the PwC
Report.   (vi) The mechanism adopted under the Plan of Conversion to 
appropriately fund policies and contracts issued between the date the  closed
block is established and the Plan Effective Date shall be comparable  to the
mechanism adopted for such purposes in recent life insurance company 
demutualizations.   (vii) Daniel J. McCarthy, F.S.A., an actuary associated
with Milliman  USA, or other nationally recognized actuary, will issue an
opinion that the  operations of the closed block established by the Company
and set forth in  the Plan of Operation, including the determination of the
required initial  funding and the manner in which cash flows are charged and
credited to the  closed block, are consistent with objectives for the closed
block set forth  in the Plan of Operation. Such actuary will also issue an
opinion that the  assets set aside at commencement of the closed block, as
specified in the  Plan of Operation, are adequate because they are expected
to produce cash  flows which, together with anticipated closed block revenue,
are reasonably  sufficient to support the closed block business, including
but not limited  to provision for the payment of claims, certain expenses and
taxes for  continuation of the 2001 policyholder dividend scales, if the
experience  underlying the scale continues.   10. Commission-Free Sales
Program.   Sponsor will establish a commission-free purchase and sale
program that will begin no later than the day that is 90 days after the
Effective Time and will continue for at least 90 days thereafter. Pursuant to
such purchase and sale program, each Eligible Shareholder who holds 99 or
fewer Sponsor Shares will have the opportunity to sell at prevailing market
prices all, but not less than all, the Sponsor Shares owned by such Eligible
Policyholder, without paying brokerage commissions, mailing charges,
registration fees or other administrative or similar expenses. Sponsor will
concurrently offer each Eligible Shareholder entitled to participate in the
commission-free purchase and sale program the opportunity to purchase that
number of Sponsor Shares necessary in order to increase such Eligible
Shareholder\'s holdings to a 100-share round lot, without paying brokerage
commissions, mailing charges, registration fees or other administrative or
similar expenses.   11. Conditions to Conversion. The Plan of Conversion
shall contain such conditions to the Conversion as are customary for
demutualizations, including without limitation, receipt of customary tax
opinions, a prohibited transaction exemption from the U.S. Department of
Labor and other customary regulatory approvals.   12. Change of Name. The
Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended and restated as set
forth in an exhibit of the Plan of Conversion, shall provide for a new name
of the Company following the Conversion, which name shall not include the
term, "Mutual".       '
