ARTICLE II 
EFFECT OF MERGER ON UNITS



Section 2.1 Effect of Merger. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of WGP, WES, Merger Sub, the holder of any
securities of WGP, WES or Merger Sub or any other Person:

(a) Conversion of Common Units. Subject to Section 1.2(f), Section 2.1(b),
Section 2.1(c), Section 2.1(d), Section 2.1(e), Section 2.2(c), Section
2.2(h), Section 2.3(a), and Section 2.4, each Common Unit issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for Common Units
held by WGP and its Subsidiaries or WES GP or those Common Units 



held by WGRAH or AEandP as set forth below) shall be converted into the right to
receive 1.525 (the "Exchange Ratio") WGP Common Units (the "Merger
Consideration").

(b) Common Units Owned by WGP and its Subsidiaries and WES GP. The Common
Units owned by WGP and its Subsidiaries or WES GP and issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unchanged and remain
outstanding and WGP and such Subsidiaries and WES GP shall continue as limited
partners of the Surviving Entity.

(c) Common Units Owned by WGRAH and AEandP. 6,375,284 Common Units issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by WGRAH shall be
unchanged and remain outstanding and WGRAH shall continue as a limited partner
of the Surviving Entity, with the balance of Common Units held by WGRAH and
the Common Units held by AEandP being converted into the right to receive an
aggregate of 55,360,984 WGP Common Units.

(d) WES GP Interest. The non-economic general partner interest in WES held by
WES GP shall be unchanged and remain outstanding and WES GP shall continue as
the general partner of the Surviving Entity.

(e) Limited Liability Company Interests in Merger Sub. The limited liability
company interests in Merger Sub that have been issued and are outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall convert into, in the
aggregate, Common Units in an amount equal to the number of Common Units

Section 2.1(a).

(f) Certificates. As of the Effective Time, all Common Units converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article II
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of (i) a certificate (a "Certificate") or (ii)
evidence of units in book-entry form ("Book-Entry Units") that in either case

consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Units in accordance with Section 2.2(c), without interest, and the right to be
admitted as a WGP Limited Partner. WGP GP hereby consents to the admission (as
a WGP Limited Partner) of each Common Unitholder who is issued WGP Common
Units in accordance with this Article II, upon the proper surrender of the
Book-Entry Units or Certificate(s) representing Common Units and acknowledges
that each such Common Unitholder shall be deemed to have made a capital
contribution to WGP. Upon such surrender of Book-Entry Units or Certificate(s)
(or upon a waiver of the requirement to surrender Book-Entry Units or
Certificate(s) granted by WGP GP in its sole discretion) and the recording of
the name of such Person as a limited partner of WGP on the books and records
of WGP, such Person shall automatically and effective as of the Effective Time
be admitted as a WGP Limited Partner and be bound by the WGP Partnership
Agreement as such. By its acceptance of WGP Common Units, a Common Unitholder
confirms its agreement to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the
WGP Partnership Agreement. 





Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date, WGP shall appoint an exchange
agent reasonably acceptable to WES (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Units with respect to Common Units for
the Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event more than three Business days following the
Effective Time, WGP will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to
each holder of record of Common Units as of the Effective Time (and, to the
extent commercially practicable, to make available for collection by hand,
during customary business hours commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, if so elected by such holder of record), whose Common Units were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Units to the
Exchange Agent, in such form as WES and WGP may reasonably agree, including,
as applicable, instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Units to the
Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(b) Deposit. At or prior to the Closing, WGP shall cause to be deposited with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Common Units
that have converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a
number of WGP Common Units (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry
form) issuable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II. Following the Effective Time, WGP agrees to make available to
the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars
sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(g) and any WGP
Common Units sufficient to pay any Merger Consideration that may be payable
from time to time following the Effective Time. All book-entry units
representing WGP Common Units deposited with the Exchange Agent (including
pursuant to Section 2.2(h)) shall be referred to in this Agreement as the
"Exchange Fund." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued or
paid pursuant to this Article II out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by WGP; provided that (i) no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Common Units, and WGP shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Common Units in the
amount of any such losses; and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30
days.

(c) Exchange. Each holder of Common Units that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, a Certificate (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Unit (which shall be deemed
surrendered upon delivery of a properly completed letter of transmittal) and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will
be entitled to receive in 



exchange therefor the number of WGP Common Units representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of WGP Common Units that such holder has the right
to receive in accordance with the provisions of this Article II. The Merger
Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable after receipt by the
Exchange Agent of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Units and letter of transmittal in accordance with the
foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration or
on any unpaid distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Units. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Unit shall,
after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Units shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Common Units formerly represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Units.

(d) Other Payees. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate(s) (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units are registered, it
shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making
of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
surrendered Certificate(s) (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Units or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the
Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than
the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate(s) (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units are
registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the
surrendered Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Units shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in
the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate(s)
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

(e) No Further Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration on the books of WES of transfers of Common Units that
have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units representing Common
Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Common Units, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Units are presented to the Exchange Agent or WGP, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this Article II.

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Common Unitholders 12 months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to WGP, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged such holder's Common Units for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.2 prior to that time shall thereafter look only
to WGP for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holder's
Common 



Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, WGP and the Surviving Entity shall not
be liable to any Common Unitholder for any Merger Consideration duly delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any
Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by Common Unitholders immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of WGP free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) Distributions. No distributions with respect to WGP Common Units issued in
the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units until such
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Units are surrendered as provided in this Section 2.2. Following such
surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Law,
there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the WGP Common
Units, if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender,
all distributions payable in respect of any such WGP Common Units with a
record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the
date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the distributions payable with respect to such WGP Common Units
with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent
to such surrender. For purposes of distributions with respect to WGP Common
Units, all WGP Common Units to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be
entitled to distributions pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(h) No Fractional Units. No certificates or scrip representing fractional WGP
Common Units shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, all fractional WGP
Common Units that a holder of Common Units converted pursuant to the Merger
would otherwise be entitled to receive as Merger Consideration (after taking
into account all such holders' Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Units) will be aggregated and then, if a
fractional WGP Common Unit results from that aggregation, be rounded up to the
nearest whole WGP Common Unit.

(i) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by WGP, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as WGP may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Common Units represented by such
Certificate as contemplated by this Article II.

(j) Withholding Taxes. WGP and the Exchange Agent may deduct and withhold as
necessary from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code") and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
or under any provision of applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law (and 



to the extent deduction and withholding is required, such deduction and
withholding may be taken in WGP Common Units). To the extent amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such withholding was made. If withholding is taken
in WGP Common Units, WGP and the Exchange Agent shall be treated as having
sold such WGP Common Units for an amount of cash equal to the fair market
value of such WGP Common Units at the time of such deemed sale and paid such
cash proceeds to the appropriate Tax Authority.

(k) Tax Characterization of Merger. Each of WES and WGP acknowledges and
agrees that, for U.S. federal income and applicable state and local tax
purposes and pursuant to the Merger, each Common Unitholder receiving Merger
Consideration will be deemed to contribute its Common Units to WGP in exchange
for the Merger Consideration and the deemed assumption of each such Common
Unitholder's share of the liabilities of WES. Each of WES and WGP acknowledges
and agrees that, for U.S. federal income and applicable state and local tax
purposes, such deemed transaction is intended to qualify for non-recognition
of gain or loss pursuant to Section 721 of the Code but will be characterized
as a disguised sale transaction described in Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code
with respect to any amounts treated as a transfer of consideration pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-3(a)(1) (such treatment, the "Intended Tax
Treatment"). Unless required to do so as a result of a "determination" as
defined in Section 1313 of the Code, each of WES and WGP agrees not to make
any tax filings or otherwise take any position inconsistent with the Intended
Tax Treatment and to cooperate with the other parties to make any filings,
statements, or reports required to effect, disclose or report the Intended Tax
Treatment.



Section 2.3 Treatment of Phantom Unit Award and WES Equity Plans.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the WES GP Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering any WES Equity Plans) will take all
actions as may be necessary or required in accordance with applicable Law and
each WES Equity Plan (including the award agreements in respect of awards
granted thereunder) to give effect to this Section 2.3. At the Effective Time,
each unvested award of phantom units that is outstanding under any WES Equity
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "WES Phantom
Unit Awards") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder of any such WES Phantom Unit Award, automatically be
assumed by WGP and converted into an award of phantom units (or similar award)
of WGP (each, a "Converted WES Phantom Unit Award") under a WGP Equity Plan
with substantially the same terms and conditions (including with respect to
vesting) applicable to such Converted WES Phantom Unit Award immediately prior
to the Effective Time, representing the right to receive, in accordance with
the terms of the applicable award agreement evidencing such WES Phantom Unit
Award, a number of shares of WGP Common Units equal to the product of (i) the
number of Common Units subject to such WES Phantom Unit Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, less
applicable Taxes, if any, required to be withheld. At the Effective Time, all
distribution equivalent rights (each, an "WES DER Award") granted in tandem
with a corresponding WES Phantom Unit Award shall, by virtue of the Merger 



and without any action on the part of the holder of any such WES DER Award,
automatically be assumed by WGP and converted into a distribution equivalent
right award (or similar award) under a WGP Equity Plan (each, a "Converted WES
DER Award"), with substantially the same terms and conditions (including with
respect to vesting) applicable to such Converted WES DER Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time, representing the right to receive (i) any balance
accrued with respect to such Converted WES DER Award as of the Effective Time
in respect of distributions paid by WES in respect of the underlying WES
Phantom Unit Award to which such Converted WES DER Award relates and (ii) any
distributions made by WGP from and after the Effective Time with respect to
the number of WGP Common Units subject to the corresponding Converted WES
Phantom Unit Award to which such Converted WES DER Award relates.

(b) As of the Effective Time, WGP shall assume the obligations of WES under
the WES Equity Plans and shall assume such plans for purposes of employing
such plans to make grants of equity-based awards relating to WGP Common Units
following the Closing. From and after the Effective Time, (i) all references
to Common Units in the WES Equity Plans shall be substituted with references
to WGP Common Units; (ii) the number of WGP Common Units that will be
available for grant and delivery under each of the respective WES Equity Plans
shall equal the number of Common Units that were available for grant and
delivery under the respective WES Equity Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as adjusted to give effect to the Exchange Ratio; (iii) from
and after the Effective Time, awards under the WES Equity Plans may be granted
only to those individuals who were eligible to receive awards under the
respective WES Equity Plans immediately before the Effective Time (including
any individuals hired on or after the Effective Time who would have been
eligible for such awards pursuant to the eligibility provisions of the WES
Equity Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time); and (iv)
no participant in the WES Equity Plans shall have any right to acquire Common
Units under the WES Equity Plans from and after the Effective Time. WGP shall
reserve for issuance a number of WGP Common Units equal to the number of WGP
Common Units that will be available for grant and delivery under the WES
Equity Plans from and after the Effective Time.

(c) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, WGP shall file a Form
S-8 registration statement (or such other appropriate form) with respect to
the WGP Common Units available for grant and delivery under the WES Equity
Plans from and after the Effective Time and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long
as such WGP Common Units are available for grant and delivery under the WES
Equity Plans. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, WES shall
file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-8 registration statements filed
by WES on May 30, 2008 and December 13, 2017, as amended, in each case,
deregistering all Common Units thereunder.



Section 2.4 Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in Section 7.2),
if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number of
outstanding WGP Common Units shall have been changed into a different number
of units or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of 



any unit dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
split-up, unit distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar
transaction, the AEandP Consideration, the WGRAH Unit Consideration and the
Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of
such unit dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
split-up, unit distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar
transaction and to provide AEandP, WGRAH and the holders of Common Units, as
applicable, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event.



Section 2.5 No Dissenters' Rights. No dissenters' or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

of trust, license, lease, contract or other agreement, instrument or
obligation (each, a "Contract"), or WES Permit (including any Environmental
Permit) to which WES or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they
or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected or

material asset of WES or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of
clause (ii)(B), for such violations, conflicts, losses, defaults,

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
WES Material Adverse Effect.

and WES GP of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than such other
consents, approvals, filings, declarations or registrations that, if not
obtained, made or given, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a WES Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.5 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31, 2017,
there has not been a WES Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.6 Compliance with Laws. WES GP, WES and their Subsidiaries are, and
since the later of December 31, 2016 and their respective dates of formation
or organization have been, in compliance with and are not in default under or
in violation of any applicable law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation,
judgment, order, code, Permit, injunction, stipulation, determination, award
or decree or other legally enforceable agency requirement of, or undertaking
to, any Governmental Authority, including common law (collectively, "Laws" and
each, a "Law"), except where such non-compliance, default or violation would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a WES Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.7 WES SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. 



(a) WES has filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms, certifications,
prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other statements required to be
filed or furnished by it with the SEC since December 31, 2017 (collectively
and together with all documents filed or publicly furnished on a voluntary
basis on Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules
thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, the "WES SEC
Documents"). The WES SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in
the case of WES SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant
to the requirements of the Securities Act) or as of their respective SEC
filing dates (in the case of all other WES SEC Documents), or, if amended, as
finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), as the case may be,
applicable to such WES SEC Documents, and none of the WES SEC Documents as of
such respective dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading (other than with respect to information
supplied in writing by or on behalf of WGP, as to which WES makes no
representation or warranty).



(b) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet
of WES and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2018 (the
"Balance Sheet Date") (including the notes thereto) included in the WES SEC
Documents filed by WES and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance
Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and (iii) liabilities and obligations incurred under or in accordance with
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, neither WES nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or contingent), that would
be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance
sheet of WES prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than
as have not and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a WES Material Adverse Effect.



(c) Neither WES nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among WES and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such Contract is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, WES in WES's published financial statements or any WES SEC
Documents.



(d) Except as otherwise disclosed in the WES SEC Documents, WES is not a party
to any agreement, contract or arrangement with any Affiliate of WES, except
for any such agreement, contract or arrangement that is not required to be
disclosed in the WES SEC Documents. 





Section 3.8 Investment Company Act. Neither WES nor any of its Subsidiaries is
an "investment company" or a company "controlled by" an "investment company"
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.



Section 3.9 Information Supplied. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of WGP GP, WGP and Merger Sub set forth in
Article IV, none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by
or on behalf of WES and WES GP specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (a) the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration
Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC or at
the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
(b) the Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to WES Limited
Partners, and at the time of the WES Unitholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, WES makes no representation or warranty
with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of WGP GP, WGP or Merger
Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any of the foregoing
documents.



Section 3.10 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The WES Special Committee has
received the opinion of Lazard Freres and Co. LLC ("Lazard" or the "WES
Financial Advisor"), dated as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect
that, as of such date, and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set
forth therein, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of
Common Units (other than WES GP, WGP, APC and their respective Affiliates),
after giving effect to the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (the "WES Fairness
Opinion"). WES has been authorized by the WES Financial Advisor to permit the
inclusion of the WES Fairness Opinion and/or references thereto in the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement as set forth in the WES
Financial Advisor's engagement letter.



Section 3.11 Brokers and Other Advisors. Except for Lazard, the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by WES, no broker, investment banker or
financial advisor is entitled to any broker's, finder's or financial advisor's
fee or commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the
Contribution, the Sale, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby based on arrangements made by or on behalf of WES GP, WES or any of
their respective Subsidiaries. WES has heretofore made available to WGP a
correct and complete copy of WES's engagement letter with Lazard. 





Section 3.12 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in this Article III, or with respect
to the Recipients in Article VI, none of WES GP, WES nor any other Person
makes or has made any express or implied representation or warranty with

income of the business that is to be conducted by the Companies and the Assets
in 2019 will be qualifying income, provided that no significant change occurs
after the Closing Date with respect to the methods by which the Assets
generate revenue. No action has been taken, or is contemplated, by a
Contributor or a Company that is expected to result in a significant change in
the methods by which the Assets generate revenue.

(any such action, a "WES Change in Recommendation") in response to an
Intervening Event if the WES Special Committee or the WES GP Board has
reasonably determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, if any, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, as modified
by the WES Partnership Agreement; provided, however, that a WES Change in
Recommendation may not be made unless and until WES has given WGP written
notice of such action and the basis thereof five days in advance (unless at
the time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are fewer than
five days prior to the expected date of the WES Unitholders Meeting, as may be
adjusted pursuant to Section 7.1, in which case such notice shall be provided
as far in advance as practicable), which notice shall set forth in writing
that the WES Special Committee or the WES GP Board, as applicable, intends to
consider whether to take such action and a reasonably detailed description of
the material events giving rise to the Intervening Event. After giving such
notice and prior to effecting such WES Change in Recommendation, WES shall
negotiate in good faith with WGP (to the extent WGP wishes to negotiate) to
make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the WES
Special Committee or the WES GP Board, as applicable, not to effect a WES
Change in Recommendation in response thereto. At the end of the five-day
period (or such shorter period as is permitted by this Section 7.5), prior to
taking action to effect a WES 



Change in Recommendation, the WES Special Committee or the WES GP Board, as
applicable, shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by WGP in writing and any other information offered by WGP in
response to the notice, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and their respective financial
advisors, if any, that the failure to effect a WES Change in Recommendation in
response to such Intervening Event would continue to be inconsistent with its
duties under applicable Law, as modified by the WES Partnership Agreement.



Section 7.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section
7.6(d)), each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other and use its
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use their) commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, such actions so as to
cause the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied and to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date), (ii) prepare
and file promptly all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents, (iii) obtain promptly (and in
any event no later than the Outside Date) all approvals, consents, clearances,
expirations or terminations of waiting periods, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) obtain
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, provided that
nothing in this Section 7.5 shall require any party to take any action that
constitutes a Burdensome Condition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take all action necessary
to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes
applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any
state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that
such transaction may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law
on the transaction.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) not
communicate with a Governmental Authority relating to the transactions without
providing the Primary Parties a reasonable opportunity to participate and, if
initiated by a Governmental Authority, promptly inform the Primary Parties of
(and supply to the Primary Parties) any communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and
any material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding
by a private Person, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the Primary Parties to review in advance and
incorporate their reasonable comments in any communication to be given by it
to any Governmental Authority with respect to obtaining any clearances
required under any Antitrust Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated 



hereby and (iv) consult with the Primary Parties in advance of any meeting or
teleconference with any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not
prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other Person, give the Primary
Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
teleconferences. Subject to Section 7.8(b), the parties shall share
information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant
to this Section 7.5 in a manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege,
including through the entry of a mutually acceptable joint defense or common
interest agreement.

(d) APC and WGP shall lead and have final decision-making authority under this
Section 7.5, taking into consideration in good faith the views of WES.



Section 7.7 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by APC, WGP and WES. Thereafter through the Effective
Time, none of APC, WES or WGP shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of
each such other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any applicable listing
agreement with the NYSE or other national securities exchange as determined in
the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such release (in which
case such party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release
or other public announcement without prior consultation with each such other
party). For the avoidance of doubt, the WES Special Committee may issue its
own press release in the event of a WES Change in Recommendation in accordance
with Section 7.5.



Section 7.8 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries, to afford to the other parties and their Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to all of its and its
Subsidiaries' properties, commitments, books, Contracts, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives and the opportunity to copy any such books, records or
documents. Each party shall furnish promptly to the other parties (i) a copy
of each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant
to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any
communication (including "comment letters") received by such party from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business, properties and personnel as the
other parties may reasonably request (including information necessary to
prepare the Proxy Statement). Each party and its Representatives shall hold
information received from the other parties pursuant to this Section 7.8 in
confidence. 



(b) This Section 7.8 shall not require any party to permit any access, or to
disclose any information, if in the reasonable, good faith judgment of such
party (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) (i)
such access or disclosure would reasonably be expected to result in any
violation of any contract or Law to which such party or its Subsidiaries is a
party or is subject or cause any privilege (including attorney-client
privilege) that such party or any of its Subsidiaries or the WES Special
Committee or the WGP Special Committee would be entitled to assert to be
undermined with respect to such information, and such undermining of such
privilege could adversely affect in any material respect such party's or the
WES Special Committee's or the WGP Special Committee's position in any pending
or future litigation or (ii) such party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and another party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in litigation, and such information is reasonably pertinent
thereto; provided that, in the case of clause (i), the parties hereto shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow the disclosure of such information
(including by entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the
extent doing so (A) would not (in the good faith belief of the party being
requested to disclose the information (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of
any such contract or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined with respect to such information or (B) could reasonably (in the
good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose the information
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed
through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which
appropriately designated Representatives of the other parties shall be
provided access to such information; and provided, further, that the party
being requested to disclose the information shall (1) notify the requesting
party that such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries' obligations under any such contract or Law or are reasonably
likely to cause such privilege to be undermined, (2) communicate to the
requesting party in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such
notification and the subject matter of such information (to the extent it is
able to do so in accordance with the first proviso in this Section 7.8(b)) and
(3) if such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries' obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial
efforts to seek consent from the applicable third party to any such contract
with respect to the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not
otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such contract).

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this Section 7.8
will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties hereto.



Section 7.9 Notification of Certain Matters. Each Primary Party shall give
prompt notice to the other Primary Parties of (a) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent is
reasonably likely to be material to any Primary Party or to have a material
impact on the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such party's Knowledge,
threatened, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any
of its Subsidiaries and that relate to the transactions 



contemplated hereby, (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions
to the Closing in Article VIII and (d) any material failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be satisfied of
any of the conditions to the Closing in Article VIII; provided that, in the
case of clauses (c) and (d), the failure to comply with this Section 7.9 shall
not result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the
Closing in Article VIII, or give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement
under Article IX, if the underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would
not in and of itself give rise to such failure or right.



Section 7.10 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) For purposes of this Section 7.10, (i) "Indemnified Person" shall mean any
person who is now, has been or becomes at any time prior to the Effective
Time, an officer or director of WES, WES GP, WGP, WGP GP or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, in such person's capacity as an officer or director
of WES, WES GP, WGP, WGP GP or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and also with respect to any such person, in their capacity as a
director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not such other entity or
enterprise is affiliated with WES or WGP) if such person is or was serving at
the request of or on behalf of WES, WES GP, WGP, WGP GP or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, and together with such person's heirs, executors or
administrators and (ii) "Proceeding" shall mean any actual or threatened
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or otherwise and whether or not such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation results in a formal civil or
criminal litigation or regulatory action.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, WGP and the Surviving Entity jointly and severally agree to
(i) indemnify and hold harmless against any reasonable costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses
and obligations (including experts' fees, travel expenses, court costs,
retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well
as telecommunications, postage and courier charges)) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in
or participate in, any Proceeding, including any Proceeding relating to a
claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Person,
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) in
connection with any Proceeding, and provide advancement promptly, and in any
event within 10 days after any written request, of any of the foregoing
expenses to, all Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and (ii) honor the provisions regarding elimination of
liability of officers and directors, indemnification of present or former
officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses contained in the
WES Charter Documents, comparable governing instruments of WES GP and any
Subsidiary of WES or WES GP immediately prior to 



the Effective Time, or any individual indemnification agreements, and ensure
that the organizational documents of the Surviving Entity, WES GP and their
respective Subsidiaries or any respective successor or assign thereof, if
applicable, shall, for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors,
officers, employees and agents of WES, WES GP and their respective
Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the WES Charter Documents and
comparable governing instruments of WES GP and the Subsidiaries of WES or WES
GP. Any right of indemnification, advancement, exculpation or elimination of
liability of an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 7.10(b) shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Person as provided herein and
shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Person and their respective heirs and
representatives against WGP and the Surviving Entity and their respective
successors and assigns.

(c) WGP shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain in effect, for
six years from the Effective Time, WES's and WES GP's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time with respect to each Indemnified Person
(provided that WGP or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, may substitute
therefor policies with reputable carriers of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified
Persons); provided, however, that if WES or WES GP in its sole discretion
elects, then, in lieu of the foregoing obligations of WGP under this Section
7.10(c), WGP shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, prior to the
Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were
committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Persons in
their capacity as such.

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this Section 7.10 shall be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
organizational documents of WES, WES GP, the Surviving Entity, WGP, WGP GP,
the DRULPA, the DLLCA or any contractual indemnity agreement with WES GP or
WGP GP. The provisions of this Section 7.10 shall survive the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby for a period of six years and are
expressly intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their
respective heirs and representatives; provided, however, that in the event
that any claim or claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this
Section 7.10 are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of all such claims. If WGP or the Surviving Entity
or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their
businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in each such case, to the
extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made so that the respective
successors and assigns of WGP and the Surviving Entity shall assume the
obligations of WGP and the Surviving Entity set forth in this Section 7.10.



Section 7.11 Securityholder Litigation. Each of APC, WES and WGP shall give
each other the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
securityholder litigation against 



such party and/or its officers and directors relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided that the party subject to the litigation shall
in any event control such defense and/or settlement and shall not be required
to provide information if doing so would be reasonably expected to threaten
the loss of any attorney-client privilege or other applicable legal privilege.



Section 7.12 Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, including all legal, accounting,
financial advisory, consulting and other fees and expenses of third parties
incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be the obligation of the respective party incurring such fees
and expenses (other than the filing fee payable to the SEC in connection with
the Registration Statement which shall be borne one half by WES and one half
by WGP).



Section 7.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, WGP and WES
shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Common Units (including
derivative securities with respect to Common Units) or acquisitions of WGP
Common Units (including derivative securities with respect to WGP Common
Units) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to WES, or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to WGP, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.



Section 7.14 Listing. WGP shall cause the WGP Common Units to be issued
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement to be approved for listing
(subject, if applicable, to notice of issuance) for trading on the NYSE prior
to the Closing.



Section 7.15 Distributions. After the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each of WGP and WES shall coordinate with the other regarding
the declaration of any distributions in respect of WGP Common Units, Common
Units and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the
intention of the parties that holders of Common Units shall not receive, for
any quarter, both distributions in respect of Common Units and also
distributions in respect of WGP Common Units, as the case may be, that they
receive in exchange therefor in the Merger, but that they shall receive for
any such quarter either: (a) only distributions in respect of Common Units or
(b) only distributions in respect of WGP Common Units that they receive in the
Merger. 





Section 7.16 Special Committees.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) the WES GP Board shall not, without the
consent of the WES Special Committee, eliminate the WES Special Committee, or
revoke or diminish the authority of the WES Special Committee, or remove or
cause the removal of any director of the WES GP Board who is a member of the
WES Special Committee either as a member of the WES GP Board or the WES
Special Committee, and (ii) WGP shall not, without the consent of the WES
Special Committee, remove or cause the removal of any director of the WES GP
Board who is a member of the WES Special Committee either as a member of the
WES GP Board or the WES Special Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section 7.16(a) shall not apply to the filling of any vacancies caused by the
death, incapacity or resignation of any director in accordance with the
provisions of the WES GP Agreement.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) the WGP GP Board shall not, without the
consent of the WGP Special Committee, eliminate the WGP Special Committee, or
revoke or diminish the authority of the WGP Special Committee, or remove or
cause the removal of any director of the WGP GP Board who is a member of the
WGP Special Committee either as a member of the WGP GP Board or the WGP
Special Committee, and (ii) APC shall not (and shall not cause any of its
Subsidiaries to), without the consent of the WGP Special Committee, remove or
cause the removal of any director of the WGP GP Board who is a member of the
WGP Special Committee either as a member of the WGP GP Board or the WGP
Special Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 7.16(b) shall not
apply to the filling of any vacancies caused by the death, incapacity or
resignation of any director in accordance with the provisions of the WGP GP
Agreement.



Section 7.17 Voting and Consent.

(a) WGP and APC covenant and agree that, until the Effective Time or the
earlier of a termination of this Agreement, at the WES Unitholders Meeting or
any other meeting of WES Limited Partners or any vote of WES Limited Partner
Interests or any written consent of the WES Limited Partners in connection
with a vote of the WES Limited Partners, however called, WGP and APC will
vote, or cause to be voted (or execute a written consent with respect
thereto), all WES Limited Partner Interests then owned beneficially or of
record by them or any of their Subsidiaries, as of the record date for such
meeting, in favor of the approval of this Agreement (as it may be amended or
otherwise modified from time to time), the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and any actions required in furtherance thereof. WGP and
APC consent to, and have caused or shall cause, to the extent necessary and to
the extent permitted by the organizational documents thereof, each of their
Subsidiaries (other than WES GP and WES) to consent to, this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any amendments of the WES
Partnership Agreement (including the WES LPA Amendment) that are necessary or
advisable in order to implement the Contribution. 



(b) Except for the issuance of additional Class C Units in the ordinary course
or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, neither WGP nor APC shall, and
WGP and APC shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, without the
prior written consent of the WES Special Committee, in any manner (i) acquire,
agree to acquire or make any proposal or offer to acquire (except as
contemplated by this Agreement), any additional securities or property of or
interests in WES or any of its Subsidiaries, or any rights or options to
acquire any such securities, property or interests; or (ii) Transfer, or enter
into any contract, option, agreement or other arrangement or understanding
with respect to the Transfer of, any of the WES Limited Partner Interests held
by such Person or any other equity securities in WES held, directly or
indirectly, by such Person or beneficial ownership or voting power thereof or
therein (including by operation of law), except to the extent permitted by
this Agreement.

sale of WGP Common Units pursuant to Section 2.2(j). In rendering such
opinion, Vinson and Elkins LLP shall be entitled to receive and rely upon

of their respective Affiliates as to such matters as such counsel may
reasonably request.

the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, or other breach of
or noncompliance with this Agreement.

(the "Outside Date"); provided that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.1(b)(i) shall not be available to a Primary Party (A) if
the inability to satisfy such condition was due to the failure of such Primary
Party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or (B) if another

(i) if WES shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of WES set forth in
this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would (if
it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by WES within 30 days following
receipt of written notice from WGP of such breach or failure; provided that

Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.2(d) or
Section 8.2(e) and(B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by such
Contributing Party or Seller within 30 days following receipt of written
notice from WGP of such breach or failure; provided that WGP shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c)(ii) if
WGP is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

(iii) if prior to the time the WES Unitholder Approval is obtained, the WES
Special Committee or the WES GP Board shall have effected a WES Change in
Recommendation; 



(d) by WES:

(i) if WGP shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of WGP set forth in
this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would (if
it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by WGP within 30 days following
receipt of written notice from WES of such breach or failure; provided that
WES shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(d)(i) if WES is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; or

(ii) if any Contributor shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of a Contributing
Party or Seller set forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which
breach or failure (A) would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the
Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
8.5(b) or Section 8.5(c) or Section 8.7(b) or Section 8.7(c) and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by such Contributing Party or
Seller within 30 days following receipt of written notice from WES of such

this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d)(ii) if WES is then in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement.

(e) by APC if any Recipient shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (or if any of the representations or warranties of any Recipient set
forth in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (i)
would (if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.4(a) or Section 8.4(b) or
Section 8.6(a) or Section 8.6(b) and (ii) is incapable of being cured, or is
not cured, by such Recipient within 30 days following receipt of written

the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) if APC
is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.



Section 9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other parties, specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to
which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void (other than the provisions in this Section 9.2, the last sentence of
Section 7.8(a), Section 7.11, Section 9.3 and Article XI, all of which shall
survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the
part of the parties or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates,
except nothing shall relieve any party hereto from any liability or damages
for any failure to consummate the Pre-Closing Transactions, the Sale, the
Contribution, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby when
required pursuant to this Agreement or any 



party from liability for fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement.



Section 9.3 Termination Fees.

shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by WGP to be paid within three Business days after the occurrence
of the event triggering such payment.

(c) Liquidated Damages. The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that, without these agreements, none of the parties would enter
into this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the payment of the WES
Termination Fee if, as, and when required pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall
not constitute a penalty but shall be liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the party receiving such payment and its
Affiliates party hereto or any other Person (collectively, the "Payee") in the
circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. Subject to Section 11.7, the parties agree that
the payment of the WES Termination Fee by WES shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Payee in respect of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby against WES any of its Affiliates or any
Financing Source. The parties further agree that in no event shall WES be
required to pay the WES Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.3 shall survive any termination
of this Agreement. 





ARTICLE X 
INDEMNIFICATION



Section 10.1 Survival; Indemnification.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the representations,
warranties and agreements of each party hereto shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
any other party hereto, whether prior to or after the execution of this
Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 10.1(b), the representations,
warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective
Time or, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2, upon the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, as the case may be, except that the

7.14, and any other agreements in this Agreement which contemplate performance
after the Effective Time, shall survive the Effective Time.

(b) The representations and warranties of the Recipients in Article VI and the
Contributors in Article V shall survive the Closing until the applicable dates
specified in Sections 10.1(c) and 10.1(d) and regardless of any inspection or
investigation by or on behalf of the Recipients and the Contributors; provided
that any representation or warranty with respect to which a claim for
indemnification has been brought pursuant to this Article X that is pending at
the end of the applicable survival period shall continue to survive until the
final resolution of such claim.

(c) The liability of the Contributors for the breach of any of the
representations and warranties of the Contributors set forth in Article V
shall be limited to claims for which a Partnership Indemnified Party delivers
written notice to APC on or before the date that is 18 months after the
Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) the representations and warranties
in Section 5.9 shall be limited to claims for which a Partnership Indemnified
Party delivers written notice to APC on or before the date that is 24 months
after the Closing Date; and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.6 and 5.7 shall not be limited as to time other than
the applicable statute of limitations.

(d) The liability of the Recipients for the breach of any of the
representations and warranties of the Recipients set forth in Article VI shall
be limited to claims for which an Anadarko Indemnified Party delivers written
notice to WES on or before 18 months after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 6.1 and
6.2 shall not be limited as to time other than the applicable statute of
limitations.



Section 10.2 Indemnification of the Anadarko Indemnified Parties. Solely for
the purpose of indemnification in this Section 10.2, the representations and
warranties of the Recipients in 



Article VI of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made without regard
to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers. WES, from and after
the Closing Date, shall indemnify and hold the Contributors and their
Affiliates (other than WGP GP, WGP, WES GP, WES and its Subsidiaries),
shareholders, unitholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (together with APC and the Contributing Parties, the "Anadarko
Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and all Losses, suffered
or incurred by the Anadarko Indemnified Parties as a result of, caused by,
arising out of, or in any way relating to (a) subject to Section 10.1, any
breach of a representation or warranty of any Recipient in Article VI, and (b)
any breach of any agreement or covenant on the part of any Recipient (in its
capacity as such) in this Agreement.



Section 10.3 Indemnification of the Partnership Indemnified Parties. Solely
for the purpose of indemnification in this Section 10.3, the representations
and warranties of the Contributors in Article V of this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been made without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse
Effect qualifiers. APC shall indemnify and hold the Recipients and their
Affiliates (other than APC and any other Person controlled by APC other than
WGP GP, WGP, WES GP, WES and its Subsidiaries), shareholders, unitholders,
members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (together
with the Recipients, the "Partnership Indemnified Parties") harmless from and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by the Partnership Indemnified
Parties as a result of, caused by, arising out of, or in any way relating to:

(a) subject to Section 10.1, any breach of a representation or warranty of any
Contributor in Article V;

(b) any breach of any agreement or covenant on the part of any Contributor (in
its capacity as such) in this Agreement;

(c) any Taxes imposed on or incurred by any Company or related to any Asset
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date, or with respect to the matters on Schedule
10.3(e);

(d) the failure to obtain, make or comply with any Asset Required Consents;
and

(e) the matters set forth on Schedule 5.5 and Schedule 10.3(e).



Section 10.4 Demands. The Indemnified Party agrees that within 30 days after
it becomes aware of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnification pursuant
to this Article X, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion,
claim, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (any
such third party action being referred to herein as the "Indemnity Claim"),
with respect to any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to indemnity
under the provisions of this Agreement, it will provide notice thereof in
writing to the Indemnifying Party specifying in reasonable detail the nature
of and specific basis for such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party's failure to provide notice under this Section 10.4 will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from the liability hereunder with respect to
such matter except in the event and only to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. Such notice shall
include a formal demand for indemnification under this Agreement.



Section 10.5 Right to Contest and Defend. The Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled at its cost and expense to contest and defend by all appropriate
legal proceedings any Indemnity Claim with respect to which it is called upon
to indemnify the Indemnified Party under the provisions of Article X of this
Agreement; provided that notice of the intention to so contest shall be
delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within 20 days
from the date of receipt by the Indemnifying Party of notice by the
Indemnified Party of the assertion of the Indemnity Claim. Any such contest
may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party as may be appropriate. Such contest shall be conducted by
reputable counsel (in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnifying Party)
employed by the Indemnifying Party and not reasonably objected to by the
Indemnified Party, but the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the
obligation to participate in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel
of its own choosing at its sole cost and expense. The Indemnifying Party shall
have full authority to determine all action to be taken with respect such
proceedings; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will not have the
authority to subject the Indemnified Party to any obligation whatsoever, other
than the performance of purely ministerial tasks or obligations not involving
material expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to contest any such
Indemnity Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the result obtained
with respect to such claim by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
shall have assumed the defense of an Indemnity Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim
that the Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Indemnity Claim, which fully and completely releases the Indemnified
Party in connection with such Indemnity Claim and which would not otherwise
adversely affect the Indemnified Party.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in
defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the Indemnified Party which the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines, upon the advice of outside counsel, 



cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages. If such
equitable relief or other relief portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so
separated from that for money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages.



Section 10.6 Cooperation. The Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party with respect to all aspects of the defense of any Indemnity
Claims covered by the indemnification set forth in this Article X, including
by promptly furnishing to the Indemnifying Party any correspondence or other
notice relating thereto that the Indemnified Party may receive, permitting the
names of the Indemnified Party to be utilized in connection with such defense,
making available to the Indemnifying Party any files, records or other
information of the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party reasonably
considers relevant to such defense and making available to the Indemnifying
Party any employees of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that in
connection therewith, the Indemnifying Party agrees to use reasonable efforts
to minimize the impact thereof on the operations of the Indemnified Party, and
further agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all files, records and other
information furnished by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 10.6,
unless otherwise required by Law or the listing standards of the NYSE or any
other applicable exchange or quotation system. In no event shall the
obligation of the Indemnified Party to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence be construed as imposing
upon the Indemnified Party an obligation to hire and pay for counsel in
connection with the defense of any claims covered by the indemnification set
forth in this Article X; 



provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may, at its own option, cost and
expense, hire and pay for counsel in connection with any such defense. The
Indemnifying Party agrees to keep any such counsel hired by the Indemnified
Party reasonably informed as to the status of any such defense, but the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to retain sole control over such
defense to the extent provided above.



Section 10.7 Payment of Losses. The indemnification required hereunder shall
be made by monthly payments of the amount thereof during the course of the
investigation or defense and within 30 days as and when reasonably specific
bills are received or Loss is incurred and reasonable evidence thereof is
delivered. In calculating any amount to be paid by an Indemnifying Party by
reason of the indemnification provisions of this Agreement, the amount to be
paid shall be reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds related to indemnified
Losses realized by the Indemnified Party and (ii) any amounts related to
indemnified Losses recovered by the Indemnified Party under contractual
indemnities from third parties.



Section 10.8 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) To the extent the Partnership Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 10.3(a) (other than for Losses
related to a breach of the representations and warranties in Section 5.6 or
Section 5.7), APC shall not be liable for those Losses unless the aggregate
amount of Losses exceeds $40,150,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only to the
extent of any such excess;

(b) In addition, to the extent the Partnership Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 10.3(a), APC shall
not be liable for such Losses that exceed, in the aggregate, $1,003,750,000,
less the Deductible;

(c) Notwithstanding Section 10.8(a) and Section 10.8(b), to the extent the
Partnership Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification (i) for Losses

and 5.7, (ii) pursuant to Section 10.3(b), 10.3(c), 10.3(d), or 10.3(e), or
(iii) for claims arising from fraud, APC shall be fully liable for such Losses
without respect to the Deductible in Section 10.8(a) and the limitations in
Section 10.8(b);

(d) To the extent the Anadarko Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 10.2(a), WES shall not be
liable for those Losses unless the aggregate amount of Losses exceeds, in the
aggregate, the Deductible, and then only to the extent of any such excess. In
addition, to the extent the Anadarko Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification for Losses pursuant to Section 10.2(a), WES shall not be
liable for such Losses that exceed, in the aggregate, $401,500,000 less the
Deductible; and

(e) Notwithstanding Section 10.8(d), to the extent the Anadarko Indemnified

Deductible and the limitations in Section 10.8(d).

and the Partnership Indemnified Parties' exclusive remedy against each other
with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the parties contained in Article V and Article VI and in the
covenants in this Agreement to be performed prior to the Closing, in each case
other than claims or causes of action arising from fraud. All references in
this Article X to such breaches of such representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements include any affirmation of such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in the certificates delivered at Closing to
the Contributing Parties pursuant to Section 8.4, the Recipient Parties
pursuant to Section 8.5, Seller pursuant to Section 8.6 and Buyer pursuant to
Section 8.7.

to the Cash Consideration.

INTENDED TO BE GIVEN FULL AND LITERAL EFFECT, AND SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER

EXPENSES OR DAMAGES IN QUESTION ARISE OR AROSE SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE
GROSS, ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER
FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. THE CONTRIBUTORS AND THE RECIPIENTS
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND
CONSTITUTES CONSPICUOUS NOTICE. NOTICE IN THIS CONSPICUOUS NOTICE IS NOT
INTENDED TO PROVIDE OR ALTER THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF APC AND THE
PARTIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SPECIFIED ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT.



ARTICLE XI 
MISCELLANEOUS





Section 11.1 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after receipt of WES Unitholder Approval, by a written agreement of
the parties; provided, however, that (a) any such amendments or supplements
must be approved by the WES Special Committee and the WGP Special Committee
and (b) following approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereunder by the Common Unitholders, there shall be no amendment
or change to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law would require
further approval by the Common Unitholders without such approval. Whenever a
determination, decision, approval, or consent of WES or the WES GP Board or of
WGP or the WGP GP Board is required pursuant to this Agreement, such
determination, decision, approval, or consent must be authorized by the WES
Special Committee or the WGP Special Committee, as applicable, unless it has
expressly waived in writing its right to give or make such determination,
decision, approval, or consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set forth in
this Section 11.1 and in Section 9.3(c), Section 11.5 and Section 11.13 (and
the defined terms used therein) may not be amended, modified or altered in a
manner adverse to the interests of the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources affected thereby (it being understood
that the consent of any Person described in clause (b) of the definition of
"Financing Source" shall not be required).



Section 11.2 Extension of Time, Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party
hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements
contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such
party's conditions; provided, however, that the WES GP Board or the WGP GP
Board may not take or authorize any action under this Section 11.2 or
otherwise grant any waiver under this Agreement unless it has first been
approved in writing by the WES Special Committee or the WGP Special Committee,
as applicable. In the event the WES GP Board or the WGP GP Board takes or
authorizes any action under this Section 11.2 or otherwise grants any consent
under this Agreement without the concurrence of the WES Special Committee or
the WGP Special Committee, as applicable, then the WES Special Committee or
the WGP Special Committee, as applicable, may rescind its approval of this
Agreement, with such rescission resulting in the rescission of "Special
Approval" under Section 7.9 of the WES Partnership Agreement and Section 7.10
of the WGP Partnership Agreement, as applicable. No failure or delay by any
party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement
on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.
For the avoidance of doubt, any rescission of "Special Approval" under the WES
Partnership Agreement pursuant to the prior sentence shall not, in and of
itself, constitute a WES Change in Recommendation under this Agreement.





Section 11.3 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or Transferred, in whole
or in part, by merger, consolidation, operation of Law or otherwise, by any of
the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under
this Section 11.3 shall be null and void.



Section 11.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable
document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other electronic means intended to
preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will
have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the
original signature.



Section 11.5 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; No Reliance.

(a) This Agreement, the Ancillary Documents, the Recipient Ancillary
Documents, and the Schedules (i) constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement
and thereof and (ii) shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights (including third-party beneficiary rights or otherwise) or
remedies hereunder, except for, in the case of clause (ii), (A) the provisions
of Section 7.10, Section 9.3(c), Section 11.1, Section 11.5, Section 11.12 and
Section 11.13 (provided that Section 9.3(c), Section 11.1, Section 11.5,
Section 11.12 and Section 11.13 are intended for the benefit of and is
enforceable by the Financing Sources and provided further that in such case
the Financing Sources will be subject to all the limitations and procedures of
this Agreement as if it were a party hereunder) and (B) the right of the
Common Unitholders to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing (a
claim by the Common Unitholders with respect to which may not be made unless
and until the Closing shall have occurred) and the right of holders of WES
Phantom Unit Awards to receive the Merger Consideration to which they are
entitled pursuant to this Agreement after the Closing (a claim by such holders
with respect to which may not be made unless and until the Closing shall have
occurred). For the avoidance of doubt, the Financing Sources shall be deemed
third party beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in Section 9.3(c),
Section 11.1, Section 11.5, Section 11.12 and Section 11.13, each of which
shall be enforceable by each Financing Source and none of which shall be
amended or otherwise modified in any way that adversely affects the rights of
any Financing Source without the prior written consent of the Financing
Sources.

(b) Each party acknowledges and agrees to the provisions set forth in Section
3.12 and Section 4.12 and, without limiting such provisions, additionally
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth Article III, Article IV, Article V 



and Article VI and the Schedules or any certificates delivered pursuant to
this Agreement: (i) none of WES GP, WES, WGP, WGP GP, Merger Sub or any other
Person will have or be subject to any liability or other obligation to WGP,
WGP GP, Merger Sub, WES GP, WES or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to WGP or WES, as applicable (including their respective
Representatives), or WGP's or WES's (or their respective Representatives') use
of, any such information, including any information, documents, projections,
forecasts or other materials made available to WGP or WES in certain "data
rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the Merger, (ii) no party
has made or is making any other representations, warranties, statements,
information or inducements; (iii) no party has relied on or is relying on any
other representations, warranties, statements, information or inducements; and
(iv) each party hereby disclaims reliance on any other representations,
warranties, statements, information or inducements provided to such party by
the other party, in each case for clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), oral or
written, express or implied, or as to the accuracy or completeness of any
statements or other information, made by, or made available by, itself or any
of its Representatives, in each case with respect to, or in connection with,
the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement, any instrument or
other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and notwithstanding the distribution, disclosure or other
delivery to the other or the other's Representatives of any documentation or
other information with respect to any one or more of the foregoing, and waives
any claims or causes of action relating thereto.



Section 11.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed entirely within that State.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by any other party hereto or its permitted successors or assigns,
shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 11.6,
(ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, 



attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.



Section 11.7 Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that each of APC, WES and WGP shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this Section 11.7 in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that
(a) the party seeking an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each party
further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy referred to in this Section 11.7, and each party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.



Section 11.8 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered

by like notice to the other parties hereto. All such notices, requests and
other communications shall be deemed received on the date of receipt by the
recipient thereof if received prior to 5:00 P.M. in the place of receipt and
such day is a Business day in the place of receipt. Otherwise, any such
notice, request or communication shall be deemed not to have been received
until the next succeeding Business day in the place of receipt. 



Section 11.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.



Section 11.10 Provision Respecting Legal Representation.

(a) It is acknowledged that Bracewell LLP has represented the WES Special
Committee prior to Closing in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, as well as prior transactions involving WES.
Each party, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and
Representatives, irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications
between the WES Special Committee and its counsel and information or documents
subject to attorney work-product protection made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of and closing under, or any
claim, dispute, proceeding or obligation arising under or in connection with
this Agreement, which, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be
a privileged communication or subject to attorney work-product protection and
would not be subject to disclosure to a party or its Affiliates or
Representatives, shall continue after the Closing to be a privileged
communication between the WES Special Committee and its counsel or attorney 



work product, and neither a party, its Affiliates or Representatives nor
anyone acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through them shall be
entitled to use or seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that
the privilege attached to such communication or attorney work-product belongs
to the party or its Affiliates or Representatives and not to the WES Special
Committee or its counsel. Any access thereto by a party or its Affiliates or
Representatives shall not waive or otherwise affect the rights of the WES
Special Committee with respect to the related privilege.

(b) It is acknowledged that Richards, Layton and Finger, P.A. has represented
the WGP Special Committee prior to Closing in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives, irrevocably acknowledges and
agrees that all communications between the WGP Special Committee and its
counsel and information or documents subject to attorney work-product
protection made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of and closing under, or any claim, dispute, proceeding or obligation
arising under or in connection with this Agreement, which, immediately prior
to the Closing, would be deemed to be a privileged communication or subject to
attorney work-product protection and would not be subject to disclosure to a
party or its Affiliates or Representatives, shall continue after the Closing
to be a privileged communication between the WGP Special Committee and its
counsel or attorney work product, and neither a party, its Affiliates or
Representatives nor anyone acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through
them shall be entitled to use or seek to obtain the same by any process on the
grounds that the privilege attached to such communication or attorney work-
product belongs to the party or its Affiliates or Representatives and not to
the WGP Special Committee or its counsel. Any access thereto by a party or its
Affiliates or Representatives shall not waive or otherwise affect the rights
of the WGP Special Committee with respect to the related privilege.



Section 11.11 Interpretation.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of,
or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any
agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such agreement,
instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and
references to all attachments 



thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a Person are also
to its permitted successors and assigns.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement with the assistance of counsel and other advisors
and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or
interim drafts of this Agreement.

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that any breach or noncompliance with
this Agreement by WES GP or WES shall be disregarded and shall not be deemed a
breach if such breach or noncompliance was caused by WGP or any of its
Representatives acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, WGP.



Section 11.12 Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney,
representative or affiliate of any party hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates (unless such Affiliate is expressly a party to this Agreement)
shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort) for any obligations
or liabilities of such party arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 11.12 shall limit any liability of the parties to this Agreement for
breaches of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.



Section 11.13 No Recourse to Financing Sources.

(a) Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, Seller, on behalf of its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives, covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that no Person other than Buyer (and its successors or assignees,
as applicable) has any obligation hereunder with respect to the Sale and that,
neither Seller, its Affiliates or its or their representatives have any right
of recovery under (i) this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or (ii)
the debt financing obtained by Buyer in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Financing"), against, and no personal
liability under this Agreement or any Transaction Document shall attach to,
any Financing Source, through Buyer or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability
company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Buyer against any
Financing Source, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, whether in contract,
equity, tort or otherwise. Neither Seller, nor any of its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives, (A) will have any rights or claims against any
Financing Source (solely in their respective capacities as Financing Sources)
in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by, or
entered into in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise, including 



any commitments by the Financing Sources in respect of financing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) will seek to enforce this
Agreement against any Financing Source (solely in their respective capacities
as Financing Sources) or (C) will bring any claim or cause of action against
any Financing Source (solely in their respective capacities as Financing
Sources) under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by, or
entered into in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise, including any commitments by the Financing Sources in
respect of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, in no event will any Financing Source be liable for consequential,
special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of
profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortuous nature.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto
acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any legal proceeding, whether
involving claims in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, the
Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto shall
be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting
in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court
thereof and each party hereto submits for itself and its property with respect
to any such legal proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (ii)
not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else
in bringing any such legal proceeding in any other court, (iii) that service
of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them
at their respective addresses provided in Section 11.8 shall be effective
service of process against them for any such proceeding brought in any such
court, (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable legal requirements, any objection which any of them may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such legal proceeding in any such court, (v)
TO WAIVE AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH
LEGAL PROCEEDING, (vi) that a final judgment in any such legal proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable legal requirements; and
(vii) that any such legal proceedings shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such State that would result in the application of
the laws of any other State.

(c) To the extent that any party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity
from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
each such party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Section 11.13 and (ii) submits to the
personal jurisdiction of any court described in this Section 11.13.



Section 11.14 Further Assurances. Upon the request of any party at any time on
or after the Closing, the requested party shall, or if requested shall cause
its Affiliate to, promptly execute and deliver such further instruments of
assignment, transfer, conveyance, endorsement, direction 



or authorization and other documents as the requesting party may reasonably
request in order in order to effectuate the purposes of this Agreement or any
of the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or

(through an asset acquisition, merger, stock acquisition or other form of
investment) control over all or a portion of the assets, properties or
business of another Person for the purpose of increasing for a period
exceeding the short-term the operating capacity or operating income of the

Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



The foregoing definition of Adjusted Capital Account is intended to comply
with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and
shall be interpreted consistently therewith. The "Adjusted Capital Account" of
a Partner in respect of any Partnership Interest shall be the amount that such
Adjusted Capital Account would be if such Partnership Interest were the only
interest in the Partnership held by such Partner from and after the date on
which such Partnership Interest was first issued.

property or other consideration at the time of contribution and in the case of
an Adjusted Property, the fair market value of such Adjusted Property on the
date of the Revaluation Event as described in 5.5(d)(1), in both cases as
determined by the General Partner. In making such determination, the General
Partner shall use such method as it determines to be appropriate to allocate
the aggregate Agreed Value of Adjusted Properties or Contributed Properties
contributed to the Partnership in a single or integrated transaction among
each separate property on a basis proportional to the fair market value of
each such property.

"Asset HoldCo" means WGR Asset Holding Company LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company, and any successors thereto.

the Partnership's proportionate share of cash and cash equivalents in the case
of Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned) on hand at the end of such Quarter,
and (ii) if the General Partner so determines, all or any portion of any
additional cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership Group on hand on the
date of determination of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter resulting
from Working Capital Borrowings made subsequent to the end of such Quarter,
less

The purpose and nature of the business to be conducted by the Partnership
shall be to (a) engage directly in, or enter into or form, hold and dispose of
any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or

therewith, to exercise all of the rights and powers conferred upon the
Partnership pursuant to the agreements relating to such business activity, and
(b) do anything necessary or appropriate to the foregoing, including the
making of capital contributions or loans to a Group Member; provided, however,

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the General Partner shall have no duty
or obligation to propose or approve, and may decline to propose or approve,
the conduct by the Partnership of any business free of any fiduciary duty or

exercise the power of attorney made in this Section 2.6(a)(ii) only after the
necessary vote, consent or approval of the Limited Partners or of the Limited
Partners of such class or series, as applicable.

Nothing contained in this Section 2.6(a) shall be construed as authorizing the
General Partner to amend this Agreement except in accordance with Article XIII
or as may be otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) The foregoing power of attorney is hereby declared to be irrevocable and a
power coupled with an interest, and it shall survive and, to the maximum

all of the Partnership assets may be held in the name of the Partnership, the
General Partner, one or more of its Affiliates or one or more nominees, as the
General Partner may determine. The General Partner hereby declares and
warrants that any Partnership assets for which record title is held in the
name of the General Partner or one or more of its Affiliates or one or more
nominees shall be held by the General Partner or such Affiliate or nominee for
the use and benefit of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement; provided, however, that the General Partner shall use
reasonable efforts to cause record title to such assets (other than those
assets in respect of which the General Partner determines that the expense and
difficulty of conveyancing makes transfer of record title to the Partnership
impracticable) to be vested in the Partnership as soon as reasonably
practicable; provided, further, that, prior to the withdrawal or removal of
the General Partner or as soon thereafter as practicable, the General Partner
shall use reasonable efforts to effect the transfer of record title to the
Partnership and, prior to any such transfer, will provide for the use of such

shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in its books and records,
irrespective of the name in which record title to such Partnership assets is

shall not affect, impair or eliminate the limitations on the liability of the
Limited Partners under this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV 

CERTIFICATES; RECORD HOLDERS; TRANSFER OF 
PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS; REDEMPTION OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

Section 4.1 Certificates.

Upon the Partnership's issuance of Common Units to any Person, the Partnership
shall issue, upon the request of such Person, one or more Certificates in the
name of such Person evidencing the number of such Units being so issued. In
addition, upon the request of any Person owning any Partnership Securities
other than Common Units, the Partnership shall issue to such Person one or
more certificates evidencing such Partnership Securities other than Common
Units. Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Partnership by the
Chairman of the Board, President or any Executive Vice President, Senior Vice
President or Vice President and the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of
the General Partner. No Common Unit Certificate shall be valid for any purpose
until it has been countersigned by the Transfer Agent; provided, however, that
the Units may be certificated or uncertificated as provided in the Delaware
Act; and provided, further, that if the General Partner elects to issue Common
Units in global form, the Common Unit Certificates shall be valid upon receipt
of a certificate from the Transfer Agent certifying that the Common Units have
been duly registered in accordance with the directions of the Partnership

Section 4.2 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.

(a) If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent or the
General Partner, as applicable, the appropriate officers of the General
Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute, and the Transfer Agent or
the General Partner, as applicable, shall countersign and deliver in exchange
therefor, a new Certificate, or shall deliver other evidence of the issuance
of uncertificated Units, evidencing the same number and type of Partnership
Securities as the Certificate so surrendered.

(b) The appropriate officers of the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership shall execute and deliver, and the Transfer Agent (for Common
Units) shall countersign, a new Certificate in place of any Certificate
previously issued if the Record Holder of the Certificate:

(i) makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the
General Partner, that a previously issued



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



(ii) Certificate has been lost, destroyed or stolen;

(iii) requests the issuance of a new Certificate, or other evidence of the
issuance of uncertificated Units, before the General Partner has notice that
the Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in good faith and
without notice of an adverse claim;

(iv) if requested by the General Partner, delivers to the General Partner a
bond, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, with surety
or sureties and with fixed or open penalty as the General Partner may direct
to indemnify the Partnership, the Partners, the General Partner and the
Transfer Agent against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged
loss, destruction or theft of the Certificate; and

(v) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the General
Partner.

If a Limited Partner fails to notify the General Partner within a reasonable
period of time after he has notice of the loss, destruction or theft of a
Certificate, and a transfer of the Limited Partner Interests represented by
the Certificate is registered before the Partnership, the General Partner or
the Transfer Agent receives such notification, the Limited Partner shall be
precluded from making any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner
or the Transfer Agent for such transfer or for a new Certificate or other
evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Units.

(c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate, or other evidence
of the issuance of uncertificated Units, under this Section 4.2, the General
Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Transfer Agent) reasonably
connected therewith.

Section 4.3 Record Holders.

The Partnership shall be entitled to recognize the Record Holder as the
Partner with respect to any Partnership Interest and, accordingly, shall not
be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such
Partnership Interest on the part of any other Person, regardless of whether
the Partnership shall have actual or other notice thereof, except as otherwise
provided by law or any applicable rule, regulation, guideline or requirement
of any National Securities Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are
listed or admitted to trading. Without limiting the foregoing, when a Person
(such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation or an
agent of any of the foregoing) is acting as nominee, agent or in some other
representative capacity for another Person in acquiring and/or holding
Partnership Interests, as between the Partnership on the one hand, and such
other Persons on the other hand, such representative Person shall be (a) the
Record Holder of such Partnership Interest and (b) bound by this Agreement and
shall have the rights and obligations of a Partner hereunder and as, and to
the extent, provided for herein.

Section 4.4 Transfer Generally.



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



(a) The term "transfer," when used in this Agreement with respect to a
Partnership Interest, shall be deemed to refer to a transaction by which the
holder of a Limited Partner Interest assigns such Limited Partner Interest to
another Person who is or becomes a Limited Partner, and includes a sale,
assignment, gift, exchange or any other disposition by law or otherwise,
including any transfer upon foreclosure of any pledge, encumbrance,
hypothecation or mortgage.

(b) No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Article IV. Any
transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in
accordance with this Article IV shall be, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, null and void.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a
disposition by any stockholder, member, partner or other owner of the General
Partner of any or all of the shares of stock, membership or limited liability
company interests, partnership interests or other ownership interests in the
General Partner.

Section 4.5 Registration and Transfer of Limited Partner Interests.

(a) The General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept on behalf of the
Partnership a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it
may prescribe and subject to the provisions of Section 4.5(b), the Partnership
will provide for the registration and transfer of Limited Partner Interests.
The Transfer Agent is hereby appointed registrar and transfer agent for the
purpose of registering Common Units and transfers of such Common Units as
herein provided. The Partnership shall not recognize transfers of Certificates
evidencing Limited Partner Interests unless such transfers are effected in the
manner described in this Section 4.5. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
registration of transfer of any Limited Partner Interests evidenced by a
Certificate, and subject to the provisions of Section 4.5(b), the appropriate
officers of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute and
deliver, and in the case of Common Units, the Transfer Agent shall countersign
and deliver, in the name of the holder or the designated transferee or
transferees, as required pursuant to the holder's instructions, one or more
new Certificates, or shall deliver other evidence of the issuance of
uncertificated Units, evidencing the same aggregate number and type of Limited
Partner Interests as was evidenced by the Certificate so surrendered.

(b) The General Partner shall not recognize any transfer of Limited Partner
Interests until the Certificates evidencing such Limited Partner Interests, or
other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Units, are surrendered for
registration of transfer. No charge shall be imposed by the General Partner
for such transfer; provided that as a condition to the issuance of any new
Certificate, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Units, under
this Section 4.5, the General Partner may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
with respect thereto.

(c) Subject to (i) the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.5, (ii) Section
4.3, (iii) Section 4.8, (iv) with respect to any class or series of Limited
Partner Interests, the provisions of any statement of designations or an
amendment to this Agreement establishing such class or series, (v) any
contractual provisions binding on any Limited Partner and (vi) provisions of
applicable law including the Securities Act, Limited Partner Interests shall
be freely transferable.



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



(d) The General Partner and its Affiliates shall have the right at any time to
transfer their Common Units, if any, to one or more Persons.

Section 4.6 Transfer of the General Partner's General Partner Interest.

(a) Subject to Section 4.6(b) below, the General Partner may transfer all or
any of its General Partner Interest without Unitholder approval.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no transfer by the
General Partner of all or any part of its General Partner Interest to another
Person shall be permitted unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the
rights and duties of the General Partner under this Agreement and to be bound
by the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion
of Counsel that such transfer would not result in the loss of limited
liability of any Limited Partner under the Delaware Act or cause the
Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not already so treated or taxed) and (iii) such transferee also agrees
to purchase all (or the appropriate portion thereof, if applicable) of the
partnership or membership or limited liability company interest of the General
Partner as the general partner or managing member, if any, of each other Group
Member. In the case of a transfer pursuant to and in compliance with this
Section 4.6, the transferee or successor (as the case may be) shall, subject
to compliance with the terms of Section 10.2, be admitted to the Partnership
as the General Partner effective immediately prior to the transfer of the
General Partner Interest, and the business of the Partnership shall continue
without dissolution.

(c) For purposes of clarification, the conversion of the General Partner
Interest into Common Units and the continuance of the General Partner as a
non-economic general partner in the Partnership as of the date hereof is not a
transfer of the General Partner Interest subject to this Section 4.6.

Section 4.7 [Reserved]

Section 4.8 Restrictions on Transfers.

(a) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article IV, no transfer of
any Partnership Interests shall be made if such transfer would (i) violate the
then applicable federal or state securities laws or rules and regulations of
the Commission, any state securities commission or any other governmental
authority with jurisdiction over such transfer, (ii) terminate the existence
or qualification of the Partnership under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
formation, or (iii) cause the Partnership to be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal
income tax purposes (to the extent not already so treated or taxed).

(b) The General Partner may impose restrictions on the transfer of Partnership
Interests if it receives an Opinion of Counsel that such restrictions are
necessary to avoid a significant risk of the Partnership becoming taxable as a
corporation or otherwise becoming taxable as an entity for federal income tax
purposes. The General Partner may impose such restrictions by amending this
Agreement; provided, however, that any amendment that would result in the
delisting or suspension of trading of any class of Limited Partner Interests
on the principal National Securities Exchange on which such class of Limited
Partner Interests is then listed or admitted to trading must be approved,



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



prior to such amendment being effected, by the holders of at least a majority
of the Outstanding Limited Partner Interests of such class.

(c) [Reserved]

(d) Nothing contained in this Article IV, or elsewhere in this Agreement,
shall preclude the settlement of any transactions involving Partnership
Interests entered into through the facilities of any National Securities
Exchange on which such Partnership Interests are listed or admitted to
trading.

(e) Any Partnership Interests shall bear a conspicuous legend in substantially
the following form:

THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY ACKNOWLEDGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF WESTERN GAS
PARTNERS, LP THAT THIS SECURITY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED, RESOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IF SUCH TRANSFER WOULD (A) VIOLATE THE THEN APPLICABLE
FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY WITH JURISDICTION OVER SUCH TRANSFER, (B) TERMINATE THE
EXISTENCE OR QUALIFICATION OF WESTERN GAS PARTNERS, LP UNDER THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE, OR (C) CAUSE WESTERN GAS PARTNERS, LP TO BE TREATED AS AN
ASSOCIATION TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE TO BE TAXED AS AN ENTITY FOR
FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES (TO THE EXTENT NOT ALREADY SO TREATED OR TAXED).
WESTERN GAS HOLDINGS, LLC, THE GENERAL PARTNER OF WESTERN GAS PARTNERS, LP,
MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY IF IT
RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO AVOID A
SIGNIFICANT RISK OF WESTERN GAS PARTNERS, LP BECOMING TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION
OR OTHERWISE BECOMING TAXABLE AS AN ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.
THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL NOT PRECLUDE THE SETTLEMENT OF ANY
TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIS SECURITY ENTERED INTO THROUGH THE FACILITIES OF
ANY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH THIS SECURITY IS LISTED OR ADMITTED
TO TRADING.

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss or

governing, organizational or similar documents) of all property owned by (x)
any other Group Member that is classified as a partnership for federal income
tax purposes and (y) any other partnership, limited liability company,

without regard to the fact that such items are not includable in gross income
or are neither currently deductible nor capitalized for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.

(iv) To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership
asset pursuant to Section 734(b) of the Code (including pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.734-2(b)(1)) is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment in the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain or loss.

(v) In the event the Carrying Value of Partnership property is adjusted

treated for purposes hereof as an item of loss (if the adjustment increases
the Carrying Value of such Liability of the Partnership) or an item of gain
(if the adjustment decreases the Carrying Value of such Liability of the
Partnership).

(c) A transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata portion
of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest
so transferred.

(d) (i) Consistent with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) and
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2), on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests
for cash or Contributed Property, the issuance of a Noncompensatory Option, or
the issuance of Partnership Interests as consideration for the provision of
services, the Capital Accounts of all Partners and the Carrying Value of each
Partnership property immediately prior to such issuance or after such
conversion shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain
or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property; provided,
however, that in the event of the issuance of a Partnership Interest pursuant
to the exercise of a Noncompensatory Option where the right to share in
Partnership capital represented by such Partnership Interest differs from the
consideration paid to acquire and exercise such option, the Carrying Value of
each Partnership property immediately after the issuance of such Partnership
Interest shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain
or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property and the Capital
Accounts of the Partners shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s); provided, further, that in
the event of an issuance of Partnership Interests for a de minimis amount of
cash or Contributed Property, in the event of an issuance of a Noncompensatory
Option to acquire a de minimis Partnership Interest or in the event of an
issuance of a de minimis amount of Partnership Interests as consideration for
the provision of services, the General Partner may determine that such
adjustments are unnecessary for the proper administration of the Partnership.
In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the aggregate fair
market value of all Partnership property (including cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests (or, in
the case of a Revaluation Event resulting from the exercise of a
Noncompensatory Option , immediately after the issuance of the Partnership
Interest acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Noncompensatory Option)
shall be determined by the General Partner using such method of valuation as
it may adopt. In making its determination of the fair market values of
individual properties, the General Partner may first determine an aggregate
value for the assets of the Partnership that takes into account the fair
market value of all Partnership Interests at such time



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



and the value of Partnership Liabilities. The General Partner may allocate
such aggregate value among the individual properties of the Partnership (in
such manner as it determines appropriate).

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(f) and
1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(h)(2), immediately prior to any distribution to a Partner
of any Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Carrying Value of all
Partnership property shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property.
In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate fair
market value of all Partnership property (including cash or cash equivalents)
immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the case of a distribution
other than one made pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined in the same manner
as that provided in Section 5.5(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating
distribution pursuant to Section 12.4, be determined by the Liquidator using
such method of valuation as it may adopt.

Section 5.6 Issuances of Additional Partnership Securities.

(a) The Partnership may issue additional Partnership Securities and options,
rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to the Partnership
Securities (including pursuant to Section 7.4(c)) for any Partnership purpose
at any time and from time to time to such Persons for such consideration and
on such terms and conditions as the General Partner shall determine, all
without the approval of any Limited Partners.

(b) Each additional Partnership Security authorized to be issued by the
Partnership pursuant to Section 5.6(a) or security authorized to be issued
pursuant to Section 7.4(c) may be issued in one or more classes, or one or
more series of any such classes, with such designations, preferences, rights,
powers and duties (which may be senior to existing classes and series of
Partnership Securities), as shall be fixed by the General Partner, including
(i) the right to share in Partnership profits and losses or items thereof;
(ii) the right to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the rights upon
dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; (iv) whether, and the terms
and conditions upon which, the Partnership may redeem the Partnership Security
or other security; (v) whether such Partnership Security or other security is
issued with the privilege of conversion or exchange and, if so, the terms and
conditions of such conversion or exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon
which each Partnership Security or other security will be issued, evidenced by
certificates and assigned or transferred; (vii) the method for determining the
Percentage Interest as to such Partnership Security; and (viii) the right, if
any, of each such Partnership Security to vote on Partnership matters,
including matters relating to the relative rights, preferences and privileges
of such Partnership Security.

(c) The General Partner shall take all actions that it determines to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with (i) each issuance of Partnership
Securities and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to
Partnership Securities pursuant to this Section 5.6, or Section 7.4(c), (ii)
reflecting admission of such additional Limited Partners in the books and
records of the Partnership as the Record Holder of such Limited Partner
Interest and (iii) all additional issuances of Partnership Securities. The
General Partner shall determine the relative rights, powers and duties of the
holders of the Units or other Partnership Securities being so issued. The
General Partner shall



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



do all things necessary to comply with the Delaware Act and is authorized and
directed to do all things that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in
connection with any future issuance of Partnership Securities or in connection
with the conversion of the General Partner Interest into Units pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, including compliance with any statute, rule,
regulation or guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or
any National Securities Exchange on which the Units or other Partnership
Securities are listed or admitted to trading.

(d) No fractional Units shall be issued by the Partnership.

Section 5.7 [Reserved]

Section 5.8 Limited Preemptive Right.

Except as provided in this Section 5.8 and in Section 5.2, no Person shall
have any preemptive, preferential or other similar right with respect to the
issuance of any Partnership Security, whether unissued, held in the treasury
or hereafter created. The General Partner shall have the right, which it may
from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of its Affiliates, to
purchase Partnership Securities from the Partnership whenever, and on the same
terms that, the Partnership issues Partnership Securities to Persons other
than the General Partner and its Affiliates, to the extent necessary to
maintain the Percentage Interests of the General Partner and its Affiliates
equal to that which existed immediately prior to the issuance of such
Partnership Securities.

Section 5.9 Splits and Combinations.

(a) Subject to Section 5.9(d), the Partnership may make a Pro Rata
distribution of Partnership Securities to all Record Holders or may effect a
subdivision or combination of Partnership Securities so long as, after any
such event, each Partner shall have the same Percentage Interest in the
Partnership as before such event, and any amounts calculated on a per Unit
basis or stated as a number of Units are proportionately adjusted.

(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Partnership
Securities is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record Date as of
which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective and
shall send notice thereof at least 20 days prior to such Record Date to each
Record Holder as of a date not less than 10 days prior to the date of such
notice. The General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public
accountants selected by it to calculate the number of Partnership Securities
to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such distribution,
subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be entitled to rely on
any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the accuracy
of such calculation.

(c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the
Partnership may issue Certificates, or other evidence of the issuance of
uncertificated Units, to the Record Holders of Partnership Securities as of
the applicable Record Date representing the new number of Partnership
Securities held by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such
other procedures that it determines to be necessary or appropriate to reflect
such changes. If any such combination results in a smaller total number of
Partnership Securities Outstanding, the Partnership shall require, as a
condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such new Certificate, or other



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Units, the surrender of any
Certificate, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Units, held
by such Record Holder immediately prior to such Record Date.

(d) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units upon any distribution,
subdivision or combination of Units. If a distribution, subdivision or
combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional Units but for
the provisions of this Section 5.9(d), each fractional Unit shall be rounded
to the nearest whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to the next higher
Unit).

Section 5.10 Fully Paid and Non-Assessable Nature of Limited Partner
Interests.

All Limited Partner Interests issued pursuant to, and in accordance with the
requirements of, this Article V shall be fully paid and non-assessable Limited
Partner Interests in the Partnership, except as such non-assessability may be
affected by Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware Act.

ARTICLE VI 

ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Section 6.1 Allocations for Capital Account Purposes.

For purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights
of the Partners among themselves, the Partnership's items of income, gain,
loss and deduction (computed in accordance with Section 5.5(b)) for each
taxable period shall be allocated among the Partners as provided herein below.

(a) Net Income. Net Income for each taxable period (including a pro rata part
of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in
computing Net Income for such taxable period) shall be allocated as follows:

(i) First, to the General Partner until the aggregate amount of Net Income
allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this Section 6.1(a)(i) for the
current and all previous taxable periods is equal to the aggregate amount of
Net Loss allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(iii) for
all previous taxable periods; and

(ii) Second, 100% to the Unitholders in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests.



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



(b) Net Loss. Net Loss for each taxable period (including a pro rata part of
each item of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing
Net Loss for such taxable period) shall be allocated as follows:

(i) First, 100% to the Unitholders in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests; provided that Net Losses shall not be allocated pursuant
to this Section 6.1(b)(i) to the extent that such allocation would cause any
Unitholder to have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account at the
end of such taxable period (or increase any existing deficit balance in its
Adjusted Capital Account);

(ii) Second, to the Unitholders in accordance with the positive balances in
their Adjusted Capital Accounts; and

(iii) Third, the balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner.

(c) [Reserved]

(d) Special Allocations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
6.1, the following special allocations shall be made for each taxable period:

(i) Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 6.1, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain
during any Partnership taxable period, each Partner shall be allocated items
of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision.
For purposes of this Section 6.1(d), each Partner's Adjusted Capital Account
balance shall be determined, and the allocation of gross income or gain
required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other
allocations pursuant to this Section 6.1(d) with respect to such taxable
period (other than an allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(vi) and Section
6.1(d)(vii)). This Section 6.1(d)(i) is intended to comply with the
Partnership Minimum Gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

(ii) Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. Notwithstanding the
other provisions of this Section 6.1 (other than Section 6.1(d)(i)), except as
provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net
decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any Partnership
taxable period, any Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum
Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent
periods) in the manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections
1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions. For purposes
of this Section 6.1(d), each Partner's Adjusted Capital Account balance shall
be determined, and the allocation of gross income or gain required hereunder
shall be effected, prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant
to this Section 6.1(d), other than Section 6.1(d)(i) and other than an
allocation pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(vi) and Section 6.1(d)(vii), with
respect to such taxable period. This Section 6.1(d)(ii) is intended to comply
with the chargeback of items



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



of income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4)
and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

(iii) [Reserved].

(iv) Qualified Income Offset. In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704-1(b)(2)
(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership gross income and gain shall be specially
allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to
the extent required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section
704(b) of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted Capital
Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly
as possible; provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(iv)
shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit
balance in its Adjusted Capital Account after all other allocations provided
for in this Section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if this Section
6.1(d)(iv) were not in this Agreement.

(v) Gross Income Allocations. In the event any Partner has a deficit balance
in its Capital Account at the end of any Partnership taxable period in excess
of the sum of (A) the amount such Partner is required to restore pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Partner is deemed
obligated to restore pursuant to Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and
1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership
gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible;
provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 6.1(d)(v) shall be made
only if and to the extent that such Partner would have a deficit balance in
its Adjusted Capital Account after all other allocations provided for in this
Section 6.1 have been tentatively made as if Section 6.1(d)(iv) and this
Section 6.1(d)(v) were not in this Agreement.

(vi) Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period
shall be allocated to the Partners Pro Rata. If the General Partner determines
that the Partnership's Nonrecourse Deductions should be allocated in a
different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner
is authorized, upon notice to the other Partners, to revise the prescribed
ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements.

(vii) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic
Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such Partner
Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or
among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such
Economic Risk of Loss.

(viii) Nonrecourse Liabilities. For purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of the
Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership Minimum Gain
and (B) the total amount of



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance
with their respective Percentage Interests.

(ix) Certain Distributions Subject to Section 734(b). To the extent an
adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to
Section 734(b) of the Code (including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.734-2(b)(1)) is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts
as a result of a distribution to a Partner in complete liquidation of such
Partner's interest in the Partnership, the amount of such adjustment to the
Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment
increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such
basis) taken into account pursuant to Section 5.5, and such item of gain or
loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent with
the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted
pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

(x) [Reserved]

(xi) Curative Allocation.

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.1, other than the
Required Allocations, the General Partner shall take the Required Allocations
into account in making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent possible,
the net amount of items of gross income, gain, loss and deduction allocated to
each Partner pursuant to the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations,
together, shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have been
allocated to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations had the Required
Allocations and the related Curative Allocation not otherwise been provided in
this Section 6.1. In exercising its discretion under this Section
6.1(d)(xi)(A), the General Partner may take into account future Required
Allocations that, although not yet made, are likely to offset other Required
Allocations previously made. Allocations pursuant to this Section
6.1(d)(xi)(A) shall only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the
extent the General Partner determines that such allocations will otherwise be
inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners.

(B) The General Partner shall, with respect to each taxable period, (1) apply
the provisions of Section 6.1(d)(xi)(A) in whatever order is most likely to
minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result from the
Required Allocations, and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to Section
6.1(d)(xi)(A) among the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such
economic distortions.

Section 6.2 Allocations for Tax Purposes.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for federal income tax purposes, each
item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among the Partners
in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or
deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1.



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss,
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
federal income tax purposes among the Partners in the manner provided under
Section 704(c) of the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, as determined appropriate by the
General Partner (taking into account the General Partner's discretion under
Section 6.1(d)(x)(D)); provided that in all events the General Partner shall
apply the "remedial allocation method" in accordance with the principles of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d).

(c) The General Partner may determine to depreciate or amortize the portion of
an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code attributable to unrealized
appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent of the unamortized Book-
Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from the depreciation or
amortization method and useful life applied to the unamortized Book-Tax
Disparity of such property, despite any inconsistency of such approach with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.167(c)-l(a)(6) or any successor regulations
thereto. If the General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot
reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and
amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Limited Partner
Interests in the same month would receive depreciation and amortization
deductions, based upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a
direct interest in the Partnership's property. If the General Partner chooses
not to utilize such aggregate method, the General Partner may use any other
depreciation and amortization conventions to preserve the uniformity of the
intrinsic tax characteristics of any Limited Partner Interests, so long as
such conventions would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited
Partners or the Record Holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner
Interests.

(d) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1245-1(e) and
1.1250-1(f), any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after
taking into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this
Section 6.2, be characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and
to the same extent as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have
been allocated any deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the
treatment of such gains as Recapture Income.

(e) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to
any election under Section 754 of the Code that may be made by the
Partnership; provided, however, that such allocations, once made, shall be
adjusted (in the manner determined by the General Partner) to take into
account those adjustments permitted or required by Sections 734 and 743 of the
Code.

(f) [Reserved]

(g) [Reserved]

(h) If, as a result of an exercise of a Noncompensatory Option, a Capital
Account reallocation is required under Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the General Partner shall make corrective allocations
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

Section 6.3 Requirement and Characterization of Distributions; Distributions
to Record Holders.

(a) Within 45 days following the end of each Quarter, an amount equal to 100%
of Available Cash with respect to such Quarter shall, subject to Section
17-607 of the Delaware Act, be distributed in accordance with this Article VI,
by the Partnership to the Partners as of the Record Date selected by the
General Partner. All distributions required to be made under this Agreement
shall be made subject to Section 17-607 of the Delaware Act.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.3(a), in the event of the dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership, all receipts received during or after the
Quarter in which the Liquidation Date occurs shall be applied and distributed
solely in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section
12.4.

(c) The General Partner may treat taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of,
or amounts withheld with respect to, all or less than all of the Partners, as
a distribution of Available Cash to such Partners.

(d) Each distribution in respect of a Partnership Interest shall be paid by
the Partnership, directly or through the Transfer Agent or through any other
Person or agent, only to the Record Holder of such Partnership Interest as of
the Record Date set for such distribution. Such payment shall constitute full
payment and satisfaction of the Partnership's liability in respect of such
payment, regardless of any claim of any Person who may have an interest in
such payment by reason of an assignment or otherwise.

Section 7.2 Certificate of Limited Partnership.

The General Partner has caused the Certificate of Limited Partnership to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by the
Delaware Act. The General Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to
be filed such other certificates or documents that the General Partner
determines to be necessary or appropriate for the formation, continuation,
qualification and operation of a limited partnership (or a partnership in
which the limited partners have limited liability) in the State of Delaware or
any other state in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own
property. To the extent the General Partner determines such action to be
necessary or appropriate, the General Partner shall file amendments to and
restatements of the Certificate of Limited Partnership and do all things to
maintain the Partnership as a limited partnership (or a partnership or other
entity in which the limited partners have limited liability) under the laws of
the State of Delaware or of any other state in which the Partnership may elect
to do business or own property. Subject to the terms of Section 3.4(a), the
General Partner shall not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or
mail a copy of the Certificate of Limited Partnership, any qualification
document or any amendment thereto to any Limited Partner.

Section 7.3 Restrictions on the General Partner's Authority.

Except as provided in Article XII and Article XIV, the General Partner may not
sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Partnership Group, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions (including by way of merger, consolidation,
other combination or sale of ownership interests of the Partnership's
Subsidiaries) without the approval of holders of a Unit Majority; provided,
however, that this provision shall not preclude or limit the General Partner's
ability to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in all
or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership Group and shall not
apply to any forced sale of any or all of the assets of the Partnership Group
pursuant to the foreclosure of, or other realization upon, any such
encumbrance. Without the approval of holders of a Unit Majority, the General
Partner shall not, on behalf of the Partnership, except as permitted under
Section 4.6, Section 11.1, Section 11.2 or Section 12.1(a), elect or cause the
Partnership to elect a successor general partner of the Partnership.

Section 7.4 Reimbursement of the General Partner.

(a) Except as provided in this Section 7.4 and elsewhere in this Agreement,
the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services as a general
partner or managing member of any Group Member.

(b) The General Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such other
basis as the General Partner may determine, for (i) all direct and indirect
expenses it incurs or payments it makes on behalf of the Partnership Group
(including salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to any
Person, including Affiliates of the General Partner to perform services for
the Partnership Group or for the General Partner in the discharge of its
duties to the Partnership Group),



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



and (ii) all other expenses allocable to the Partnership Group or otherwise
incurred by the General Partner in connection with operating the Partnership
Group's business (including expenses allocated to the General Partner by its
Affiliates). The General Partner shall determine the expenses that are
allocable to the Partnership Group. Reimbursements pursuant to this Section
7.4 shall be in addition to any reimbursement to the General Partner as a
result of indemnification pursuant to Section 7.7.

(c) The General Partner, without the approval of the Limited Partners (who
shall have no right to vote in respect thereof), may propose and adopt on
behalf of the Partnership employee benefit plans, employee programs and
employee practices (including plans, programs and practices involving the
issuance of Partnership Securities or options to purchase or rights, warrants
or appreciation rights or phantom or tracking interests relating to
Partnership Securities), or cause the Partnership to issue Partnership
Securities in connection with, or pursuant to, any employee benefit plan,
employee program or employee practice maintained or sponsored by the General
Partner, Group Member or any Affiliates in each case for the benefit of
employees and directors of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, in
respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the
Partnership Group. The Partnership agrees to issue and sell to the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates any Partnership Securities that the General
Partner or such Affiliates are obligated to provide to any employees and
directors pursuant to any such employee benefit plans, employee programs or
employee practices. Expenses incurred by the General Partner in connection
with any such plans, programs and practices (including the net cost to the
General Partner or such Affiliates of Partnership Securities purchased by the
General Partner or such Affiliates from the Partnership to fulfill options or
awards under such plans, programs and practices) shall be reimbursed in
accordance with Section 7.4(b). Any and all obligations of the General Partner
under any employee benefit plans, employee programs or employee practices
adopted by the General Partner as permitted by this Section 7.4(c) shall
constitute obligations of the General Partner hereunder and shall be assumed
by any successor General Partner approved pursuant to Section 11.1 or Section
11.2.

Section 7.5 Outside Activities.

(a) After the Closing Date, the General Partner, for so long as it is the
General Partner of the Partnership (i) agrees that its sole business will be
to act as a general partner or managing member, as the case may be, of the
Partnership and any other partnership or limited liability company of which
the Partnership is, directly or indirectly, a partner or member and to
undertake activities that are ancillary or related thereto (including being a
limited partner in the Partnership) and (ii) shall not engage in any business
or activity or incur any debts or liabilities except in connection with or
incidental to (A) its performance as general partner or managing member, if
any, of one or more Group Members or as described in or contemplated by the
Registration Statement, (B) the acquiring, owning or disposing of debt or
equity securities in any Group Member, or (C) the guarantee of, and mortgage,
pledge, or encumbrance of any or all of its assets in connection with, any
indebtedness of Anadarko, any of its successors or permitted assigns or any
other Affiliate of the General Partner.

(b) Except as set forth in the Omnibus Agreement, each Indemnitee (other than
the General Partner) shall have the right to engage in businesses of every
type and description and other activities for profit and to engage in and
possess an interest in other business ventures of any and every type



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



or description, whether in businesses engaged in or anticipated to be engaged
in by any Group Member, independently or with others, including business
interests and activities in direct competition with the business and
activities of any Group Member, and none of the same shall constitute a breach
of this Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or
otherwise, to any Group Member or any Partner. None of any Group Member, any
Limited Partner or any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this
Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, or the partnership relationship
established hereby in any business ventures of any Indemnitee.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the
engaging in competitive activities by any Indemnitees (other than the General
Partner) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.5 is hereby
approved by the Partnership and all Partners, (ii) it shall be deemed not to
be a breach of any fiduciary duty or any other obligation of any type
whatsoever of any Indemnitee for the Indemnitees (other than the General
Partner) to engage in such business interests and activities in preference to
or to the exclusion of the Partnership and (iii) the Indemnitees shall have no
obligation hereunder or as a result of any duty otherwise existing at law, in
equity or otherwise, to present business opportunities to the Partnership.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the doctrine of
corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, shall not apply to any
Indemnitee (including the General Partner). No Indemnitee (including the
General Partner) who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement,
arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Partnership,
shall have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the
Partnership, and such Indemnitee (including the General Partner) shall not be
liable to the Partnership, to any Limited Partner or any other Person for
breach of any fiduciary or other duty by reason of the fact that such
Indemnitee (including the General Partner) pursues or acquires for itself,
directs such opportunity to another Person or does not communicate such
opportunity or information to the Partnership; provided that such Indemnitee
does not engage in such business or activity as a result of or using
confidential or proprietary information provided by or on behalf of the
Partnership to such Indemnitee.

(d) The General Partner and each of its Affiliates may acquire Units or other
Partnership Securities in addition to those owned as of the date hereof and,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be entitled to exercise,
at their option, all rights relating to all Units or other Partnership
Securities acquired by them. The term "Affiliates" when used in this Section
7.5(d) with respect to the General Partner shall not include any Group Member.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent
that any provision of this Agreement purports or is interpreted to have the
effect of restricting the fiduciary duties that might otherwise, as a result
of Delaware or other applicable law, be owed by the General Partner to the
Partnership and its Limited Partners, or to constitute a waiver or consent by
the Limited Partners to any such restriction, such provisions shall be deemed
to have been approved by the Partners.

Section 7.6 Loans from the General Partner; Loans or Contributions from the
Partnership or Group Members.

(a) The General Partner or any of its Affiliates may lend to any Group Member,
and any Group Member may borrow from the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates, funds needed or desired



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



by the Group Member for such periods of time and in such amounts as the
General Partner may determine; provided, however, that in any such case the
lending party may not charge the borrowing party interest at a rate greater
than the rate that would be charged the borrowing party or impose terms less
favorable to the borrowing party than would be charged or imposed on the
borrowing party by unrelated lenders on comparable loans made on an
arm's-length basis (without reference to the lending party's financial
abilities or guarantees), all as determined by the General Partner. The
borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any costs (other than
any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party in connection
with the borrowing of such funds. For purposes of this Section 7.6(a) and
Section 7.6(b), the term "Group Member" shall include any Affiliate of a Group
Member that is controlled by the Group Member.

(b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to any Group Member, and any Group
Member may borrow from the Partnership, funds on terms and conditions
determined by the General Partner. Except for the Initial Loan, no Group
Member may lend funds to the General Partner or any of its Affiliates (other
than another Group Member).

(c) No borrowing by any Group Member or the approval thereof by the General
Partner shall be deemed to constitute a breach of any duty hereunder or
otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise, of the General Partner or
its Affiliates to the Partnership or the Limited Partners by reason of the
fact that the purpose or effect of such borrowing is directly or indirectly to
enable distributions to the General Partner or its Affiliates (including in
their capacities as Limited Partners) to exceed the General Partner's
Percentage Interest of the total amount distributed to all Partners.

Section 7.7 Indemnification.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to the limitations
expressly provided in this Agreement, all Indemnitees shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts
arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, in which any
Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or
otherwise, by reason of its status as an Indemnitee; provided that the
Indemnitee shall not be indemnified and held harmless if there has been a
final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
determining that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7, the Indemnitee acted in bad
faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal
matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee 's conduct was unlawful;
provided, further, no indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be
available to the General Partner or its Affiliates (other than a Group Member)
with respect to its or their obligations incurred pursuant to the Underwriting
Agreement, the Omnibus Agreement, the Secondment Agreement, the Contribution
Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement or the Working Capital Agreement (other
than obligations incurred by the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership). Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made
only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the General
Partner shall not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have
no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership
to enable it to effectuate such indemnification.



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is indemnified pursuant to Section
7.7(a) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding shall, from
time to time, be advanced by the Partnership prior to a final and non-
appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining
that, in respect of the matter for which the Indemnitee is seeking
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7, the Indemnitee is not entitled
to be indemnified.

(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to
any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement,
pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Limited Partner Interests,
as a matter of law or otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitee's
capacity as an Indemnitee and as to actions in any other capacity (including
any capacity under the Underwriting Agreement), and shall continue as to an
Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the
Indemnitee.

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General
Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General
Partner, its Affiliates and such other Persons as the General Partner shall
determine, against any liability that may be asserted against, or expense that
may be incurred by, such Person in connection with the Partnership's
activities or such Person's activities on behalf of the Partnership,
regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such
Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

(e) For purposes of this Section 7.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to have
requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants
or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with
respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall
constitute "fines" within the meaning of Section 7.7(a); and action taken or
omitted by it with respect to any employee benefit plan in the performance of
its duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the best interest
of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a
purpose that is in the best interests of the Partnership.

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

(h) The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees,
their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to
create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision
hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past,
present or future Indemnitee to be



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



indemnified by the Partnership, nor the obligations of the Partnership to
indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 7.7 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment,
modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to
matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification
or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

Section 7.8 Liability of Indemnitees.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, the
Limited Partners, or any other Persons who have acquired interests in the
Partnership Securities, for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a
result of any act or omission of an Indemnitee unless there has been a final
and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
determining that, in respect of the matter in question, the Indemnitee acted
in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in the case of a
criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Indemnitee's conduct was
criminal.

(b) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in
Section 7.1(a), the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to
it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder
either directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner shall not
be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent
appointed by the General Partner in good faith.

(c) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnitee has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Partnership or to the Partners, the General Partner and any other Indemnitee
acting in connection with the Partnership's business or affairs shall not be
liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith reliance on the
provisions of this Agreement.

(d) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision
hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the liability of the Indemnitees under this Section 7.8 as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

Section 7.9 Resolution of Conflicts of Interest; Standards of Conduct and
Modification of Duties.

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any Group Member
Agreement, whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between
the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Partnership, any Group Member or any Partner, on the other hand, any
resolution or course of action by the General Partner or its Affiliates in
respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by
all Partners, and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, of any
Group Member Agreement, of any agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of
any duty stated or implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of
action in respect of such conflict of interest is (i) approved by Special
Approval, (ii) approved by the vote of a majority of the Common Units
(excluding Common Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates),
(iii) on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than those generally



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or (iv) fair and
reasonable to the Partnership, taking into account the totality of the
relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that
may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership). The General
Partner shall be authorized but not required in connection with its resolution
of such conflict of interest to seek Special Approval of such resolution, and
the General Partner may also adopt a resolution or course of action that has
not received Special Approval. If Special Approval is sought, then it shall be
presumed that, in making its decision, the Special Committee acted in good
faith, and if Special Approval is not sought and the Board of Directors
determines that the resolution or course of action taken with respect to a
conflict of interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in clauses
(iii) or (iv) above, then it shall be presumed that, in making its decision,
the Board of Directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by
any Limited Partner or by or on behalf of such Limited Partner or any other
Limited Partner or the Partnership challenging such approval, the Person
bringing or prosecuting such proceeding shall have the burden of overcoming
such presumption. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
or any duty otherwise existing at law or equity, the existence of the
conflicts of interest described in the Registration Statement are hereby
approved by all Partners and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement
or any duty otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise.

(b) Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to
take any other action, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do so, in its
capacity as the general partner of the Partnership as opposed to in its
individual capacity, whether under this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement
or any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then, unless another
express standard is provided for in this Agreement, the General Partner, or
such Affiliates causing it to do so, shall make such determination or take or
decline to take such other action in good faith and shall not be subject to
any other or different standards (including fiduciary standards) imposed by
this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated
hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at
equity. In order for a determination or other action to be in "good faith" for
purposes of this Agreement, the Person or Persons making such determination or
taking or declining to take such other action must reasonably believe that the
determination or other action is in the best interests of the Partnership.

(c) Whenever the General Partner makes a determination or takes or declines to
take any other action, or any of its Affiliates causes it to do so, in its
individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as the general partner of
the Partnership, whether under this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby or otherwise, then the General
Partner, or such Affiliates causing it to do so, are entitled, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to make such determination or to take or decline to
take such other action free of any duty (including any fiduciary duty) or
obligation whatsoever to the Partnership, any Limited Partner, and any other
Person bound by this Agreement, and the General Partner, or such Affiliates
causing it to do so, shall not, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be
required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by
this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated
hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at
equity. By way of illustration and not of limitation, whenever the phrase, "at
the option of the General Partner," or some variation of that phrase, is used
in this Agreement, it indicates that the General Partner is acting in its
individual capacity. For the avoidance of doubt, whenever the General Partner
votes



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



or transfers its Partnership Interests, or refrains from voting or
transferring its Partnership Interests, it shall be acting in its individual
capacity. The General Partner's organizational documents may provide that
determinations to take or decline to take any action in its individual, rather
than representative, capacity may or shall be determined by its members, if
the General Partner is a limited liability company, stockholders, if the
General Partner is a corporation, or the members or stockholders of the
General Partner's general partner, if the General Partner is a partnership.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the General
Partner and its Affiliates shall have no duty or obligation, express or
implied, to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of any asset of the Partnership
Group other than in the ordinary course of business or (ii) permit any Group
Member to use any facilities or assets of the General Partner and its
Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts entered into from time to
time specifically dealing with such use. Any determination by the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates to enter into such contracts shall be at its
option.

(e) Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither the General
Partner nor any other Indemnitee shall have any duties or liabilities,
including fiduciary duties, to the Partnership or any Limited Partner and the
provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict, eliminate or
otherwise modify the duties and liabilities, including fiduciary duties, of
the General Partner or any other Indemnitee otherwise existing at law or in
equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace such other duties and
liabilities of the General Partner or such other Indemnitee.

(f) The Unitholders hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of the
Partnership as a partner or member of a Group Member, to approve of actions by
the general partner or managing member of such Group Member similar to those
actions permitted to be taken by the General Partner pursuant to this Section
7.9.

Section 7.10 Other Matters Concerning the General Partner.

(a) The General Partner may rely upon, and shall be protected in acting or
refraining from acting upon, any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture
or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

(b) The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants,
appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants
and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in
reliance upon the opinion (including an Opinion of Counsel) of such Persons as
to matters that the General Partner reasonably believes to be within such
Person's professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to
have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.

(c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers
or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers,
a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly authorized officers
of the Partnership or any Group Member.



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



Section 7.11 Purchase or Sale of Partnership Securities.

The General Partner may cause the Partnership to purchase or otherwise acquire
Partnership Securities. Such Partnership Securities shall be held by the
Partnership as treasury securities unless they are expressly cancelled by
action of an appropriate officer of the General Partner. As long as
Partnership Securities are held by any Group Member, such Partnership
Securities shall not be considered Outstanding for any purpose, except as
otherwise provided herein. The General Partner or any Affiliate of the General
Partner may also purchase or otherwise acquire and sell or otherwise dispose
of Partnership Securities for its own account, subject to the provisions of
Articles IV and X.

Section 7.12 Registration Rights of the General Partner and its Affiliates.

(a) If (i) the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner
(including for purposes of this Section 7.12, any Person that is an Affiliate
of the General Partner at the date hereof notwithstanding that it may later
cease to be an Affiliate of the General Partner) holds Partnership Securities
that it desires to sell and (ii) Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any
successor rule or regulation to Rule 144) or another exemption from
registration is not available to enable such holder of Partnership Securities
(the "Holder") to dispose of the number of Partnership Securities it desires
to sell at the time it desires to do so without registration under the
Securities Act, then at the option and upon the request of the Holder, the
Partnership shall file with the Commission as promptly as practicable after
receiving such request, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause
to become effective and remain effective for a period of not less than six
months following its effective date or such shorter period as shall terminate
when all Partnership Securities covered by such registration statement have
been sold, a registration statement under the Securities Act registering the
offering and sale of the number of Partnership Securities specified by the
Holder; provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be required to
effect more than three registrations pursuant to this Section 7.12(a) and
Section 7.12(b); and provided, further, however, that if the Special Committee
determines in good faith that the requested registration would be materially
detrimental to the Partnership and its Partners because such registration
would (x) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, reorganization
or other similar transaction involving the Partnership, (y) require premature
disclosure of material information that the Partnership has a bona fide
business purpose for preserving as confidential or (z) render the Partnership
unable to comply with requirements under applicable securities laws, then the
Partnership shall have the right to postpone such requested registration for a
period of not more than six months after receipt of the Holder's request, such
right pursuant to this Section 7.12(a) or Section 7.12(b) not to be utilized
more than once in any twelve-month period. In connection with any registration
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.12(a), the Partnership shall
(A) promptly prepare and file (1) such documents as may be necessary to
register or qualify the securities subject to such registration under the
securities laws of such states as the Holder shall reasonably request;
provided, however, that no such qualification shall be required in any
jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, the Partnership would become subject
to general service of process or to taxation or qualification to do business
as a foreign corporation or partnership doing business in such jurisdiction
solely as a result of such registration, and (2) such documents as may be
necessary to apply for listing or to list the Partnership Securities subject
to such registration on such National Securities Exchange as the Holder shall



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



reasonably request, and (B) do any and all other acts and things that may be
necessary or appropriate to enable the Holder to consummate a public sale of
such Partnership Securities in such states. Except as set forth in Section
7.12(d), all costs and expenses of any such registration and offering (other
than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by the
Partnership, without reimbursement by the Holder.

(b) If any Holder holds Partnership Securities that it desires to sell and
Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any successor rule or regulation to Rule
144) or another exemption from registration is not available to enable such
Holder to dispose of the number of Partnership Securities it desires to sell
at the time it desires to do so without registration under the Securities Act,
then at the option and upon the request of the Holder, the Partnership shall
file with the Commission as promptly as practicable after receiving such
request, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become
effective and remain effective for a period of not less than six months
following its effective date or such shorter period as shall terminate when
all Partnership Securities covered by such shelf registration statement have
been sold, a "shelf" registration statement covering the Partnership
Securities specified by the Holder on an appropriate form under Rule 415 under
the Securities Act, or any similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission;
provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be required to effect more
than three registrations pursuant to Section 7.12(a) and this Section 7.12(b);
and provided, further, however, that if the Special Committee determines in
good faith that any offering under, or the use of any prospectus forming a
part of, the shelf registration statement would be materially detrimental to
the Partnership and its Partners because such offering or use would (x)
materially interfere with a significant acquisition, reorganization or other
similar transaction involving the Partnership, (y) require premature
disclosure of material information that the Partnership has a bona fide
business purpose for preserving as confidential or (z) render the Partnership
unable to comply with requirements under applicable securities laws, then the
Partnership shall have the right to suspend such offering or use for a period
of not more than six months after receipt of the Holder's request, such right
pursuant to Section 7.12(a) or this Section 7.12(b) not to be utilized more
than once in any twelve-month period. In connection with any shelf
registration pursuant to this Section 7.12(b), the Partnership shall (i)
promptly prepare and file (A) such documents as may be necessary to register
or qualify the securities subject to such shelf registration under the
securities laws of such states as the Holder shall reasonably request;
provided, however, that no such qualification shall be required in any
jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, the Partnership would become subject
to general service of process or to taxation or qualification to do business
as a foreign corporation or partnership doing business in such jurisdiction
solely as a result of such shelf registration, and (B) such documents as may
be necessary to apply for listing or to list the Partnership Securities
subject to such shelf registration on such National Securities Exchange as the
Holder shall reasonably request, and (ii) do any and all other acts and things
that may be necessary or appropriate to enable the Holder to consummate a
public sale of such Partnership Securities in such states. Except as set forth
in Section 7.12(d), all costs and expenses of any such shelf registration and
offering (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid
by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the Holder.

(c) If the Partnership shall at any time propose to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act for an offering of equity securities of the
Partnership for cash (other than an offering



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



relating solely to an employee benefit plan), the Partnership shall notify all
Holders of such proposals and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
include such number or amount of securities held by the Holder in such
registration statement as the Holder shall request; provided that the
Partnership is not required to make any effort or take any action to so
include the securities of the Holder once the registration statement is
declared effective by the Commission or otherwise becomes effective, including
any registration statement providing for the offering from time to time of
securities pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act. If the proposed
offering pursuant to this Section 7.12(c) shall be an underwritten offering,
then, in the event that the managing underwriter or managing underwriters of
such offering advise the Partnership and the Holder in writing that in their
opinion the inclusion of all or some of the Holder's Partnership Securities
would adversely and materially affect the success of the offering, the
Partnership shall include in such offering only that number or amount, if any,
of securities held by the Holder that, in the opinion of the managing
underwriter or managing underwriters, will not so adversely and materially
affect the offering. Except as set forth in Section 7.12(d), all costs and
expenses of any such registration and offering (other than the underwriting
discounts and commissions) shall be paid by the Partnership, without
reimbursement by the Holder.

(d) If underwriters are engaged in connection with any registration referred
to in this Section 7.12, the Partnership shall provide indemnification,
representations, covenants, opinions and other assurance to the underwriters
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such underwriters. Further,
in addition to and not in limitation of the Partnership's obligation under
Section 7.7, the Partnership shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
indemnify and hold harmless the Holder, its officers, directors and each
Person who controls the Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and
any agent thereof (collectively, "Indemnified Persons") from and against any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses
(including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest,
settlements or other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, in which any Indemnified Person may be involved, or is
threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, under the Securities Act
or otherwise (hereinafter referred to in this Section 7.12(d) as a "claim" and
in the plural as "claims") based upon, arising out of or resulting from any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
any registration statement under which any Partnership Securities were
registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or Blue Sky laws,
in any preliminary prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of such
registration statement), or in any summary or final prospectus or free writing
prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto (if used during the
period the Partnership is required to keep the registration statement
current), or arising out of, based upon or resulting from the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading;
provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be liable to any Indemnified
Person to the extent that any such claim arises out of, is based upon or
results from an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission made in such registration statement, such preliminary,
summary or final prospectus or free writing prospectus or such amendment or
supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Partnership by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person
specifically for use in the preparation thereof.

of the General Partner's Affiliates) after it ceases to be a general partner
of the Partnership, during a period of two years subsequent to the effective
date of such cessation and for so long thereafter as is required for the
Holder to sell all of the Partnership Securities with respect to which it has
requested during such two-year period inclusion in a registration statement
otherwise filed or that a registration statement be filed; provided, however,

behalf of and in the name of the Partnership has full power and authority to
encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of the
Partnership and to enter into any authorized contracts on behalf of the
Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General
Partner or any such officer as if it were the Partnership's sole party in
interest, both legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all defenses or other remedies
that may be available against such Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any
action of the General Partner or any such officer in connection with any such
dealing. In no event shall any Person dealing with the General Partner or any
such officer or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms
of this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or
expedience of any act or action of the General Partner or any such officer or
its representatives. Each and every certificate, document or other instrument
executed on behalf of the Partnership by the General Partner or its
representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person
relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (a) at the time of the execution
and delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was

ARTICLE IX 

TAX MATTERS

Section 9.1 Tax Returns and Information.

The Partnership shall timely file all returns of the Partnership that are
required for federal, state and local income tax purposes on the basis of the
accrual method and the taxable period or periods that it is required by law to
adopt, from time to time, as determined by the General Partner. In the event
the Partnership is required to use a taxable period other than a year ending
on December 31, the General Partner shall use reasonable efforts to change the
taxable period of the Partnership to a year ending on December 31. The tax
information reasonably required by Record Holders for federal and state income
tax reporting purposes with respect to a taxable period shall be furnished to
them within 90 days of the close of the calendar year in which the
Partnership's taxable period ends. The classification, realization and
recognition of income, gain, losses and deductions and other items shall be on
the accrual method of accounting for federal income tax purposes.

Section 9.2 Tax Elections.

(a) The Partnership shall make the election under Section 754 of the Code in
accordance with applicable regulations thereunder, subject to the reservation
of the right to seek to revoke any such election upon the General Partner's
determination that such revocation is in the best interests of the Limited
Partners. Notwithstanding any other provision herein contained, for the
purposes of computing the adjustments under Section 743(b) of the Code, the
General Partner shall be authorized (but not required) to adopt a convention
whereby the price paid by a transferee of a Limited Partner Interest will be
deemed to be the lowest quoted closing price of the Limited Partner Interests
on any National Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests
are listed or admitted to trading during the calendar month in which such
transfer is deemed to occur pursuant to Section 6.2(f) without regard to the
actual price paid by such transferee.

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall determine
whether the Partnership should make any other elections permitted by the Code.

Section 9.3 Tax Controversies.

(a) Subject to the provisions hereof, the General Partner (or its designee) is
designated as the Tax Matters Partner (as defined in Section 6231(a)(7) of the
Code as in effect prior to the effective date of the Bipartisan Budget Act of
2015), and the Partnership Representative (as defined in Section 6223 of the
Code following the effective date of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015) and is
authorized to represent the Partnership (at the Partnership's expense) in
connection with all examinations of the Partnership's affairs by tax
authorities, including resulting administrative and judicial proceedings, and
to expend Partnership funds for professional services and costs associated
therewith. In its capacity as Partnership Representative, the General Partner
shall exercise any and all authority of the Partnership Representative under
the Code, including, without limitation, (i) binding the Partnership and its
Partners with respect to tax matters and (ii) determining whether to make any
available election under Section 6226 of the Code, which permits the
Partnership to pass



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



any partnership adjustment through to the Persons who were Partners of the
Partnership in the year to which the adjustment relates and irrespective of
whether such Persons are Partners of the Partnership at the time the election
under Section 6226 of the Code is made. Each Partner agrees to cooperate with
the General Partner and to do or refrain from doing any or all things
reasonably requested by the General Partner in its capacity as Partnership
Representative. For Partners that are not tax-exempt entities (as defined in
Section 168(h)(2) of the Code) and subject to the General Partner's discretion
to seek modifications of an imputed underpayment, this cooperation includes
(i) filing amended tax returns, paying any additional tax (including interest,
penalties and other additions to tax), and providing the General Partner with
an affidavit swearing to those facts (all within the requisite time periods),
and (ii) providing any other information requested by the General Partner in
order to seek modifications of an imputed underpayment. For Partners that are
tax-exempt entities (as defined in Section 168(h)(2) of the Code) and subject
to the General Partner's discretion to seek modifications of an imputed
underpayment, this cooperation includes providing the General Partner with
information necessary to establish the Partner's tax-exempt status

(b) Each Partner agrees that notice of or updates regarding tax controversies
shall be deemed conclusively to have been given or made by the General Partner
if the Partnership has either (i) filed the information for which notice is
required with the Commission via its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and
Retrieval system and such information is publicly available on such system or
(ii) made the information for which notice is required available on any
publicly available website maintained by the Partnership, whether or not such
Partner remains a Partner in the Partnership at the time such information is
made publicly available. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
nothing in this provision shall obligate the Partnership Representative to
provide notice to the Partners other than as required by the Code.

Section 9.4 Withholding and Other Tax Payments by the Partnership.

(a) The General Partner may treat taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of
all or less than all of the Partners either as a distribution of cash to such
Partners or as a general expense of the Partnership, as determined appropriate
under the circumstances by the General Partner.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
is authorized to take any action that may be required to cause the Partnership
and other Group Members to comply with any withholding requirements
established under the Code or any other federal, state or local law including
pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code. To the extent that
the Partnership is required or elects to withhold and pay over to any taxing
authority any amount resulting from the allocation or distribution of income
or from a distribution to any Partner (including by reason of Section 1446 of
the Code), the General Partner may treat the amount withheld as a distribution
of cash pursuant to Section 6.3 or Section 12.4(c) in the amount of such
withholding from such Partner.

If the Partnership pays an imputed underpayment under Section 6225 of the
Code, the General Partner may require that Partners of the Partnership in the
year to which the underpayment relates indemnify the Partnership for their
allocable share of that underpayment (including interest, penalties and other
additions to tax). This indemnification obligation shall not apply to a
Partner to the extent that (i) the Partnership received a modification of the
imputed underpayment under Section



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



6225 (c)(2) of the Code due to the Partner's filing of amended tax returns and
payment of any resulting tax (including interest, penalties and other
additions to tax), (ii) the Partner is a tax-exempt entity (as defined in
Section 168(h)(2) of the Code) and either the Partnership received a
modification of the imputed underpayment under Section 6225(c)(3) of the Code
because of such Partner's status as a tax-exempt entity or the Partnership did
not make a good faith effort to obtain a modification of the imputed
underpayment due to such Partner's status as a tax-exempt entity, or (iii) the
Partnership received a modification of the imputed underpayment under Section
6225(c)(4)-(6) of the Code as a result of other information that was either
provided by the Partner or otherwise available to the Partnership with respect
to the Partner. This indemnification obligation imposed on Partners, including
former Partners, applies irrespective of whether such Persons are Partners of
the Partnership at the time the Partnership pays the imputed underpayment.

successor shall be admitted to the Partnership until such successor has
executed and delivered such documents or instruments as may be required to
effect such admission. Any such successor shall, subject to the terms hereof,
carry on the business of the members of the Partnership Group without
dissolution.

the Limited Partners within 30 days after such occurrence. The Partners hereby
agree that only the Events of Withdrawal described in this Section 11.1 shall
result in the withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership.

(b) Withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership upon the occurrence

under the following circumstances: (i) at any time during the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending at 12:00 midnight, Central Standard Time, on
June 30, 2018, the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90

provided that prior to the effective date of such withdrawal, the withdrawal
is approved by Unitholders holding at least a majority of the Outstanding
Common Units (excluding Common Units held by the General Partner and its
Affiliates) and the General Partner delivers to the Partnership an Opinion of
Counsel ("Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel") that such withdrawal (following the
selection of the successor General Partner) would not result in the loss of
the limited liability of any Limited Partner or any Group Member or cause any
Group Member to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the
extent not already so treated or taxed); (ii) at any time after 12:00

is given one Person and its Affiliates (other than the General Partner and



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



its Affiliates) own beneficially or of record or control at least 50% of the
Outstanding Units. The withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership
upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall also constitute the
withdrawal of the General Partner as general partner or managing member, if
any, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members. If the General
Partner gives a notice of withdrawal pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i), the
holders of a Unit Majority, may, prior to the effective date of such
withdrawal, elect a successor General Partner. The Person so elected as
successor General Partner shall automatically become the successor general
partner or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group
Members of which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing
member, and is hereby authorized to, and shall, continue the business of the
Partnership, and, to the extent applicable, the other Group Members, without
dissolution. If, prior to the effective date of the General Partner's
withdrawal pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i), a successor is not selected by the
Unitholders as provided herein or the Partnership does not receive a
Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel, the Partnership shall be dissolved in
accordance with and subject to Section 12.1. Any successor General Partner
elected in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.1 shall be subject to

The General Partner may be removed if such removal is approved by the
Unitholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the Outstanding Units (including Units
held by the General Partner and its Affiliates) voting as a single class. Any
such action by such holders for removal of the General Partner must also
provide for the election of a successor General Partner by the Unitholders
holding a majority of the outstanding Common Units (including, in each case,
Units held by the General Partner and its Affiliates). Such removal shall be
effective immediately following the admission of a successor General Partner
pursuant to Section 10.2. The removal of the General Partner shall also
automatically constitute the removal of the General Partner as general partner
or managing member, to the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of
which the General Partner is a general partner or a managing member. If a
Person is elected as a successor General Partner in accordance with the terms
of this Section 11.2, such Person shall, upon admission pursuant to Section
10.2, automatically become a successor general partner or managing member, to
the extent applicable, of the other Group Members of which the General Partner
is a general partner or a managing member, and is hereby authorized to, and
shall, continue the business of the Partnership, and, to the extent
applicable, the other Group Members, without dissolution. The right of the
holders of Outstanding Units to remove the General Partner shall not exist or
be exercised unless the Partnership has received an opinion opining as to the
matters covered by a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel. Any successor General
Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.2 shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 10.2.

Section 11.3 [Reserved]

Section 11.4 [Reserved].

Section 11.5 Withdrawal of Limited Partners.

No Limited Partner shall have any right to withdraw from the Partnership;
provided, however, that when a transferee of a Limited Partner's Limited
Partner Interest becomes a Record Holder of

the terms of this Agreement. Upon the removal or withdrawal of the General
Partner, if a successor General Partner is elected pursuant to Section 10.2,
11.1, 11.2 or 12.2, the Partnership shall not be dissolved and such successor
General Partner is hereby authorized to, and shall, continue the business of
the Partnership. Subject to Section 12.2, the Partnership shall dissolve, and
its affairs shall be wound up, upon:

General Partner as provided in Section 11.1(a)(i) or (iii) and the failure of
the Partners to select a successor to such Departing General Partner pursuant
to Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, then within 90 days thereafter, or (b) an
event constituting an Event of Withdrawal as defined in Section 11.1(a)(iv),

thereafter, the holders of a Unit Majority may elect to continue the business
of the Partnership on the same terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement by appointing as a successor General Partner a Person approved by
the holders of a Unit Majority. Unless such an election is made within the
applicable time period as set forth above, the Partnership shall conduct only
activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election is so made,
then:

dissolved in accordance with this Article XII; and

(ii) the successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as
General Partner, effective as of the Event of Withdrawal, by agreeing in
writing to be bound by this Agreement;

(iii) provided that the right of the holders of a Unit Majority to approve a
successor General Partner and to continue the business of the Partnership
shall not exist and may not be exercised unless the Partnership has received
an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the exercise of the right would not result in
the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner and (y) neither the
Partnership nor any Group Member would be treated as an association taxable as
a corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for federal income tax
purposes upon the exercise of such right to continue (to the extent not
already so treated or taxed).

Section 12.3 Liquidator.

Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the business of the Partnership is
continued pursuant to Section 12.2, the General Partner shall select one or
more Persons to act as Liquidator. The Liquidator (if other than the General
Partner) shall be entitled to receive such compensation for its services as
may be approved by holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Common
Units. The Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall agree not to
resign at any time without 15 days' prior notice and may be removed at any
time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by holders of at
least a majority of the Outstanding Common Units. Upon dissolution, removal or
resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who
shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and duties of the original
Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved by holders of at least
a majority of the Outstanding Common Units. The right to approve a successor
or substitute Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to
refer also to any such successor or substitute Liquidator approved in the
manner herein provided. Except as expressly provided in this Article XII, the
Liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may exercise,
without further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of
the powers conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of this
Agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and
otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than the limitation on sale
set forth in Section 7.3) necessary or appropriate to carry out the duties and
functions of the Liquidator hereunder for and during the period of time
required to complete the winding up and liquidation of the Partnership as
provided for herein.

Section 12.4 Liquidation.

The Liquidator shall proceed to dispose of the assets of the Partnership,
discharge its liabilities, and otherwise wind up its affairs in such manner
and over such period as determined by the Liquidator, subject to Section
17-804 of the Delaware Act and the following:

(a) The assets may be disposed of by public or private sale or by distribution
in kind to one or more Partners on such terms as the Liquidator and such
Partner or Partners may agree. If any property is distributed in kind, the
Partner receiving the property shall be deemed for purposes of Section 12.4(c)
to have received cash equal to its fair market value; and contemporaneously
therewith, appropriate cash distributions must be made to the other Partners.
The Liquidator may defer liquidation or distribution of the Partnership's
assets for a reasonable time if it determines



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



that an immediate sale or distribution of all or some of the Partnership's
assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners. The
Liquidator may distribute the Partnership's assets, in whole or in part, in
kind if it determines that a sale would be impractical or would cause undue
loss to the Partners.

(b) Liabilities of the Partnership include amounts owed to the Liquidator as
compensation for serving in such capacity (subject to the terms of Section
12.3) and amounts to Partners otherwise than in respect of their distribution
rights under Article VI. With respect to any liability that is contingent,
conditional or unmatured or is otherwise not yet due and payable, the
Liquidator shall either settle such claim for such amount as it thinks
appropriate or establish a reserve of cash or other assets to provide for its
payment. When paid, any unused portion of the reserve shall be distributed as
additional liquidation proceeds.

(c) All property and all cash in excess of that required to discharge
liabilities as provided in Section 12.4(b) shall be distributed to the
Partners in accordance with, and to the extent of, the positive balances in
their respective Capital Accounts, as determined after taking into account all
Capital Account adjustments (excluding adjustments made by reason of
distributions pursuant to this Section 12.4(c)) for the taxable period of the
Partnership during which the liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with such
date of occurrence being determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)), and such distribution shall be made by the end of such
taxable period (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such
occurrence).

Section 12.5 Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership.

Upon the completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as
provided in Section 12.4 in connection with the liquidation of the
Partnership, the Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of
the Partnership as a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than
the State of Delaware shall be canceled and such other actions as may be
necessary to terminate the Partnership shall be taken.

Section 12.6 Return of Contributions.

The General Partner shall not be personally liable for, and shall have no
obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to
enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital Contributions of the
Limited Partners or Unitholders, or any portion thereof, it being expressly
understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets.

Section 12.7 Waiver of Partition.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Partner hereby waives any right
to partition of the Partnership property.

Section 12.8 Capital Account Restoration.

No Limited Partner shall have any obligation to restore any negative balance
in its Capital Account upon liquidation of the Partnership. The General
Partner shall be obligated to restore any



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of its interest in
the Partnership by the end of the taxable period of the Partnership during
which such liquidation occurs, or, if later, within 90 days after the date of
such liquidation.

to the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or "plan asset" regulations

(g) an amendment that the General Partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with the authorization of issuance of any class or
series of Partnership Securities pursuant to Section 5.6;

(h) any amendment expressly permitted in this Agreement to be made by the
General Partner acting alone;

(i) an amendment effected, necessitated or contemplated by a Merger Agreement
approved in accordance with Section 14.3;

(j) an amendment that the General Partner determines to be necessary or
appropriate to reflect and account for the formation by the Partnership of, or

7.1(a);

(k) a merger, conveyance or conversion pursuant to Section 14.3(d); or

Section 13.2 Amendment Procedures.

Except as provided in Section 13.1 and Section 13.3, all amendments to this
Agreement shall be made in accordance with the requirements contained in this
Section 13.2. Amendments to this Agreement may be proposed only by the General
Partner; provided, however, that to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
General Partner shall have no duty or obligation to propose any amendment to
this Agreement and may decline to do so free of any duty (including any
fiduciary duty) or obligation whatsoever to the Partnership, any Limited
Partner or any other Person bound by this Agreement, and, in declining to
propose an amendment, to the fullest extent permitted by law shall not be
required to act in good faith or pursuant to any other standard imposed by
this Agreement, any Group Member Agreement, any other agreement contemplated
hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation or at
equity. A proposed amendment shall be effective upon its approval by the
General Partner and the holders of a Unit Majority, unless a greater or
different percentage is required under this Agreement or by Delaware law. Each
proposed amendment that requires the approval of the holders of a specified
percentage of Outstanding Units shall be set forth in a writing that contains
the text of the proposed amendment. If such an amendment is proposed, the
General Partner shall seek the written approval of the requisite percentage of
Outstanding Units or call a meeting of the Unitholders to consider and vote on
such proposed amendment, in each case in accordance with the other provisions
of this Article XIII. The General Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon
final adoption of any such proposed amendments.



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



Section 13.3 Amendment Requirements.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.1 and Section 13.2, no
provision of this Agreement that establishes a percentage of Outstanding Units
(including Units deemed owned by the General Partner) required to take any
action shall be amended, altered, changed, repealed or rescinded in any
respect that would have the effect of reducing such voting percentage unless
such amendment is approved by the written consent or the affirmative vote of
holders of Outstanding Units whose aggregate Outstanding Units constitute not
less than the voting requirement sought to be reduced.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.1 and Section 13.2, no
amendment to this Agreement may (i) enlarge the obligations of any Limited
Partner without its consent, unless such shall be deemed to have occurred as a
result of an amendment approved pursuant to Section 13.3(c), or (ii) enlarge
the obligations of, restrict in any way any action by or rights of, or reduce
in any way the amounts distributable, reimbursable or otherwise payable to,
the General Partner or any of its Affiliates without its consent, which
consent may be given or withheld at its option.

(c) Except as provided in Section 14.3, and without limitation of the General
Partner's authority to adopt amendments to this Agreement without the approval
of any Partners or assignees as contemplated in Section 13.1, any amendment
that would have a material adverse effect on the rights or preferences of any
class of Partnership Interests in relation to other classes of Partnership
Interests must be approved by the holders of not less than a majority of the
Outstanding Partnership Interests of the class affected.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for
amendments pursuant to Section 13.1 and except as otherwise provided by
Section 14.3(b), no amendments shall become effective without the approval of
the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding Units voting as a single class
unless the Partnership obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
amendment will not affect the limited liability of any Limited Partner under
applicable partnership law of the state under whose laws the Partnership is
organized.

(e) Except as provided in Section 13.1, this Section 13.3 shall only be
amended with the approval of the holders of at least 90% of the Outstanding
Units.

Section 13.4 Special Meetings.

All acts of Limited Partners to be taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be
taken in the manner provided in this Article XIII. Special meetings of the
Limited Partners may be called by the General Partner or by Limited Partners
owning 20% or more of the Outstanding Units of the class or classes for which
a meeting is proposed. Limited Partners shall call a special meeting by
delivering to the General Partner one or more requests in writing stating that
the signing Limited Partners wish to call a special meeting and indicating the
general or specific purposes for which the special meeting is to be called.
Within 60 days after receipt of such a call from Limited Partners or within
such greater time as may be reasonably necessary for the Partnership to comply
with any statutes, rules, regulations, listing agreements or similar
requirements governing the holding of a meeting or the solicitation of proxies
for use at such a meeting, the General Partner shall send a



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



notice of the meeting to the Limited Partners either directly or indirectly
through the Transfer Agent. A meeting shall be held at a time and place
determined by the General Partner on a date not less than 10 days nor more
than 60 days after the time notice of the meeting is given as provided in
Section 16.1. Limited Partners shall not vote on matters that would cause the
Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and control
of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the Limited
Partners' limited liability under the Delaware Act or the law of any other
state in which the Partnership is qualified to do business.

Section 13.5 Notice of a Meeting.

Notice of a meeting called pursuant to Section 13.4 shall be given to the
Record Holders of the class or classes of Units for which a meeting is
proposed in writing by mail or other means of written communication in
accordance with Section 16.1. The notice shall be deemed to have been given at
the time when deposited in the mail or sent by other means of written
communication.

Section 13.6 Record Date.

For purposes of determining the Limited Partners entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to give approvals without a
meeting as provided in Section 13.11 the General Partner may set a Record
Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than 60 days before (a) the
date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts with any rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on
which the Units are listed or admitted to trading, in which case the rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of such National Securities Exchange
shall govern) or (b) in the event that approvals are sought without a meeting,
the date by which Limited Partners are requested in writing by the General
Partner to give such approvals. If the General Partner does not set a Record
Date, then (i) the Record Date for determining the Limited Partners entitled
to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners shall be the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
and (ii) the Record Date for determining the Limited Partners entitled to give
approvals without a meeting shall be the date the first written approval is
deposited with the Partnership in care of the General Partner in accordance
with Section 13.11.

Section 13.7 Adjournment.

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given
of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need not be fixed, if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken, unless such adjournment shall be for more than 45 days. At the
adjourned meeting, the Partnership may transact any business which might have
been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than
45 days or if a new Record Date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice
of the adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with this Article XIII.

Section 13.8 Waiver of Notice; Approval of Meeting; Approval of Minutes.

The transactions of any meeting of Limited Partners, however called and
noticed, and whenever held, shall be as valid as if it had occurred at a
meeting duly held after regular call and



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy. Attendance of a
Limited Partner at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of the
meeting, except when the Limited Partner attends the meeting for the express
purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of
any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened; and
except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to disapprove
the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the
meeting, but not so included, if the disapproval is expressly made at the
meeting.

Section 13.9 Quorum and Voting.

The holders of a majority of the Outstanding Units of the class or classes for
which a meeting has been called (including Outstanding Units deemed owned by
the General Partner) represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a
quorum at a meeting of Limited Partners of such class or classes unless any
such action by the Limited Partners requires approval by holders of a greater
percentage of such Units, in which case the quorum shall be such greater
percentage. At any meeting of the Limited Partners duly called and held in
accordance with this Agreement at which a quorum is present, the act of
Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent a
majority of the Outstanding Units entitled to vote and be present in person or
by proxy at such meeting shall be deemed to constitute the act of all Limited
Partners, unless a greater or different percentage is required with respect to
such action under the provisions of this Agreement, in which case the act of
the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent
at least such greater or different percentage shall be required. The Limited
Partners present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present
may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of enough Limited Partners to leave less than a quorum, if any
action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by the required percentage
of Outstanding Units specified in this Agreement (including Outstanding Units
deemed owned by the General Partner). In the absence of a quorum any meeting
of Limited Partners may be adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote
of holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Units entitled to vote at
such meeting (including Outstanding Units deemed owned by the General Partner)
represented either in person or by proxy, but no other business may be
transacted, except as provided in Section 13.7.

Section 13.10 Conduct of a Meeting.

The General Partner shall have full power and authority concerning the manner
of conducting any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals
in writing, including the determination of Persons entitled to vote, the
existence of a quorum, the satisfaction of the requirements of Section 13.4,
the conduct of voting, the validity and effect of any proxies and the
determination of any controversies, votes or challenges arising in connection
with or during the meeting or voting. The General Partner shall designate a
Person to serve as chairman of any meeting and shall further designate a
Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All minutes shall be kept with the
records of the Partnership maintained by the General Partner. The General
Partner may make such other regulations consistent with applicable law and
this Agreement as it may deem advisable concerning the conduct of any meeting
of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including
regulations in regard to the appointment of proxies, the appointment and
duties



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



of inspectors of votes and approvals, the submission and examination of
proxies and other evidence of the right to vote, and the revocation of
approvals in writing.

Section 13.11 Action Without a Meeting.

If authorized by the General Partner, any action that may be taken at a
meeting of the Limited Partners may be taken without a meeting, without a vote
and without prior notice, if an approval in writing setting forth the action
so taken is signed by Limited Partners owning not less than the minimum
percentage of the Outstanding Units (including Units deemed owned by the
General Partner) that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all the Limited Partners were present and voted (unless such
provision conflicts with any rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of any
National Securities Exchange on which the Units are listed or admitted to
trading, in which case the rule, regulation, guideline or requirement of such
National Securities Exchange shall govern). Prompt notice of the taking of
action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited Partners who have not
approved in writing. The General Partner may specify that any written ballot,
if any, submitted to Limited Partners for the purpose of taking any action
without a meeting shall be returned to the Partnership within the time period,
which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the General Partner. If a
ballot returned to the Partnership does not vote all of the Units held by the
Limited Partners, the Partnership shall be deemed to have failed to receive a
ballot for the Units that were not voted. If approval of the taking of any
action by the Limited Partners is solicited by any Person other than by or on
behalf of the General Partner, the written approvals shall have no force and
effect unless and until (a) they are deposited with the Partnership in care of
the General Partner, (b) approvals sufficient to take the action proposed are
dated as of a date not more than 90 days prior to the date sufficient
approvals are deposited with the Partnership and (c) an Opinion of Counsel is
delivered to the General Partner to the effect that the exercise of such right
and the action proposed to be taken with respect to any particular matter (i)
will not cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the
management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to
jeopardize the Limited Partners' limited liability, and (ii) is otherwise
permissible under the state statutes then governing the rights, duties and
liabilities of the Partnership and the Partners. Nothing contained in this
Section 13.11 shall be deemed to require the General Partner to solicit all
Limited Partners in connection with a matter approved by the holders of the
percentage of Units acting by written consent without a meeting.

Section 13.12 Right to Vote and Related Matters.

(a) Only those Record Holders of the Outstanding Units on the Record Date set
pursuant to Section 13.6 (and also subject to the limitations contained in the
definition of "Outstanding") shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, a
meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to matters as to which the
holders of the Outstanding Units have the right to vote or to act. All
references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be taken by,
the Outstanding Units shall be deemed to be references to the votes or acts of
the Record Holders of such Outstanding Units.

(b) With respect to Units that are held for a Person's account by another
Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation,
or an agent of any of the foregoing), in whose name such Units are registered,
such other Person shall, in exercising the voting rights in respect of such
Units on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such Persons provides



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



otherwise, vote such Units in favor of, and at the direction of, the Person
who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership shall be entitled to assume
it is so acting without further inquiry. The provisions of this Section
13.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this Agreement) are subject to
the provisions of Section 4.3.

merger, consolidation or conversion contemplated thereby, as applicable, be
submitted to a vote of Limited Partners, whether at a special meeting or by

the Partnership's assets to, another limited liability entity that shall be
newly formed and shall have no assets, liabilities or operations at the time
of such conversion, merger or conveyance other than those it receives from the
Partnership or other Group Member if (i) the General Partner has received an
Opinion of Counsel that the conversion, merger or conveyance, as the case may
be, would not result in the loss of the limited liability of any Limited
Partner or cause the Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax
purposes (to the extent not previously treated as such), (ii) the sole purpose
of such conversion, merger, or conveyance is to effect a mere change in the
legal form of the Partnership into another limited liability entity and (iii)

entity provide the Limited Partners and the General Partner with the same
rights and obligations as are herein contained.

(e) Additionally, notwithstanding anything else contained in this Article XIV
or in this Agreement, the General Partner is permitted, without Limited
Partner approval, to merge or consolidate the Partnership with or into another
entity if (i) the General Partner has received an Opinion of Counsel that the
merger or consolidation, as the case may be, would not result in the loss of

treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as
an entity for federal income tax purposes (to the extent not previously
treated as such), (ii) the merger or consolidation would not result in an
amendment to this Agreement, other than any amendments that could be adopted
pursuant to Section 13.1, (iii) the Partnership is the Surviving Business
Entity in such merger or consolidation, (iv) each Unit outstanding immediately
prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation is to be an
identical Unit of the Partnership after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, and (v) the number of Partnership Securities to be issued by
the Partnership in such merger or consolidation does not exceed 20% of the
Partnership Securities Outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of
such merger or consolidation.

(f) Pursuant to Section 17-211(g) of the Delaware Act, an agreement of merger
or consolidation approved in accordance with this Article XIV may (i) effect
any amendment to this Agreement or (ii) effect the adoption of a new
partnership agreement for the Partnership if it is the Surviving Business
Entity. Any such amendment or adoption made pursuant to this Section 14.3
shall be effective at the effective time or date of the merger or
consolidation.

Section 14.4 Certificate of Merger.

Upon the required approval by the General Partner and the Unitholders of a
Merger Agreement or the Plan of Conversion, as the case may be, a certificate
of merger or certificate of conversion, as applicable, shall be executed and
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in conformity with
the requirements of the Delaware Act.

Section 14.5 Effect of Merger, Consolidation or Conversion.

that has merged or consolidated, and all property, real, personal and mixed,
and all debts due to any of those business entities and all other things and

in the Surviving Business Entity and after the merger or consolidation shall
be the property of the Surviving Business Entity to the extent they were of

property of any of those constituent business entities shall be preserved
unimpaired; and

(iv) all debts, liabilities and duties of those constituent business entities
shall attach to the Surviving Business Entity and may be enforced against it
to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred
or contracted by it.

(b) At the effective time of the certificate of conversion, for all purposes
of the laws of the State of Delaware:

organizational form;

(ii) all rights, title, and interests to all real estate and other property
owned by the Partnership shall remain vested in the converted entity in its
new organizational form without reversion or impairment, without further act
or deed, and without any transfer or assignment having occurred, but subject
to any existing liens or other encumbrances thereon;

(iii) all liabilities and obligations of the Partnership shall continue to be
liabilities and obligations of the converted entity in its new organizational
form without impairment or diminution by reason of the conversion;

(iv) all rights of creditors or other parties with respect to or against the
prior interest holders or other owners of the Partnership in their capacities
as such in existence as of the effective time of the conversion will continue
in existence as to those liabilities and obligations and are enforceable
against the converted entity by such creditors and obligees to the same extent
as if the liabilities and obligations had originally been incurred or
contracted by the converted entity; and

(v) the Partnership Interests that are to be converted into partnership
interests, shares, evidences of ownership, or other rights or securities in
the converted entity or cash as provided in the Plan of Conversion shall be so
converted, and Partners shall be entitled only to the rights provided in the

RIGHT TO ACQUIRE LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS

Section 15.1 Right to Acquire Limited Partner Interests.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time the
General Partner and its Affiliates hold more than 80% of the total Limited
Partner Interests of any class then Outstanding, the General Partner shall
then have the right, which right it may assign and transfer in whole or in
part to the Partnership or any Affiliate of the General Partner, exercisable
at its option, to purchase all, but not less than all, of such Limited Partner
Interests of such class then Outstanding held by Persons other than the
General Partner and its Affiliates, at the greater of (x) the Current Market
Price as of the date three days prior to the date that the notice described in
Section 15.1(b) is mailed and (y) the highest price paid by the General
Partner or any of its Affiliates for any such Limited Partner Interest of such
class purchased during the 90-day period preceding the date that the notice
described in Section 15.1(b) is mailed. As used in this Agreement, (i)
"Current Market Price" as of any date of any class of Limited Partner
Interests means the average of the daily Closing Prices (as hereinafter
defined) per Limited Partner Interest of such class for the 20 consecutive
Trading Days (as hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; (ii)
"Closing Price" for any day means the last sale price on such day, regular
way, or in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the
closing bid and asked prices on such day, regular way, as reported in the
principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities
listed on the principal National Securities Exchange (other than the Nasdaq
Stock Market) on which such Limited Partner Interests are listed or admitted
to trading or, if such Limited Partner Interests of such class are not listed
or admitted to trading on any National Securities Exchange (other than the
Nasdaq Stock Market), the last quoted price on such day or, if not so quoted,
the average of the high bid and low asked prices on such day in the over-the-
counter market, as reported by the Nasdaq Stock Market or such other system
then in use, or, if on any such day such Limited Partner Interests of such
class are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid
and asked prices on such day as furnished by a professional market maker
making a market in such Limited Partner Interests of such class selected by
the General Partner, or if on any such day no market maker is making a market
in such Limited Partner Interests of such class, the fair value of such
Limited Partner Interests on such day as determined by the General Partner;
and (iii) "Trading Day" means a day on which the principal National Securities
Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests of any class are listed or
admitted for trading is open for the transaction of business or, if Limited
Partner Interests of a class are not listed or admitted for trading on any
National Securities Exchange, a day on which banking institutions in New York
City generally are open.

(b) If the General Partner, any Affiliate of the General Partner or the
Partnership elects to exercise the right to purchase Limited Partner Interests
granted pursuant to Section 15.1(a), the General Partner shall deliver to the
Transfer Agent notice of such election to purchase (the "Notice of Election to
Purchase") and shall cause the Transfer Agent to mail a copy of such Notice of
Election to Purchase to the Record Holders of Limited Partner Interests of
such class (as of a Record Date selected by the General Partner) at least 10,
but not more than 60, days prior to the Purchase Date. Such Notice of Election
to Purchase shall also be published for a period of at least three consecutive



Western Gas Partners, LP

Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership 



days in at least two daily newspapers of general circulation printed in the
English language and published in the Borough of Manhattan, New York. The
Notice of Election to Purchase shall specify the Purchase Date and the price
(determined in accordance with Section 15.1(a)) at which Limited Partner
Interests will be purchased and state that the General Partner, its Affiliate
or the Partnership, as the case may be, elects to purchase such Limited
Partner Interests, upon surrender of Certificates representing such Limited
Partner Interests, or other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Units,
in exchange for payment, at such office or offices of the Transfer Agent as
the Transfer Agent may specify, or as may be required by any National
Securities Exchange on which such Limited Partner Interests are listed. Any
such Notice of Election to Purchase mailed to a Record Holder of Limited
Partner Interests at his address as reflected in the records of the Transfer
Agent shall be conclusively presumed to have been given regardless of whether
the owner receives such notice. On or prior to the Purchase Date, the General
Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, shall deposit
with the Transfer Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
purchase price of all of such Limited Partner Interests to be purchased in
accordance with this Section 15.1. If the Notice of Election to Purchase shall
have been duly given as aforesaid at least 10 days prior to the Purchase Date,
and if on or prior to the Purchase Date the deposit described in the preceding
sentence has been made for the benefit of the holders of Limited Partner
Interests subject to purchase as provided herein, then from and after the
Purchase Date, notwithstanding that any Certificate, or other evidence of the
issuance of uncertificated Units, shall not have been surrendered for
purchase, all rights of the holders of such Limited Partner Interests
(including any rights pursuant to Article III, Article IV, Article V, Article
VI, and Article XII) shall thereupon cease, except the right to receive the
purchase price (determined in accordance with Section 15.1(a)) for Limited
Partner Interests therefor, without interest, upon surrender to the Transfer
Agent of the Certificates representing such Limited Partner Interests, or
other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Units, and such Limited
Partner Interests shall thereupon be deemed to be transferred to the General
Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, on the record
books of the Transfer Agent and the Partnership, and the General Partner or
any Affiliate of the General Partner, or the Partnership, as the case may be,
shall be deemed to be the owner of all such Limited Partner Interests from and
after the Purchase Date and shall have all rights as the owner of such Limited
Partner Interests (including all rights as owner of such Limited Partner
Interests pursuant to Article III, Article IV, Article V, Article VI and
Article XII).

(c) At any time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an Outstanding
Limited Partner Interest subject to purchase as provided in this Section 15.1
may surrender his Certificate evidencing such Limited Partner Interest, or
other evidence of the issuance of uncertificated Units, to the Transfer Agent
in exchange for payment of the amount described in Section 15.1(a), therefor,
without interest thereon.

from the date of the giving or making of such notice, payment or report to the

against any Lender Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

Conditions Precedent. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 2.1 to the
contrary, the Indemnitor shall not have any indemnification obligation under
this Agreement unless Indemnitee has exhausted all of its remedies, if any,
under the limited partnership agreement of Borrower (the "Partnership
Agreement") and under applicable law to collect from Borrower the amount of
any Lender Claim; provided, however, that Indemnitee need not exhaust any
remedies against Borrower to the extent Indemnitee reasonably determines that
the expense anticipated to be incurred by Indemnitee in pursuing such claim
against Borrower with respect to collection of the amount of the Lender Claim
would exceed the anticipated recovery from Borrower with respect to such 



2.3 Lender Claims.

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

Notice of Lender Claim. If any Lender Claimant notifies Indemnitee with
respect to any Lender Claim, then Indemnitee will promptly give written notice
to Indemnitor; provided, however, that no delay on the part of Indemnitee in
notifying Indemnitor will relieve Indemnitor from any obligation under this
Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Assumption of Defense, etc. Indemnitor will be entitled to participate in the
defense of any Lender Claim that is the subject of a notice given by
Indemnitee pursuant to Section 2.3(a). In addition, Indemnitor will have the
right to assume the defense of such Lender Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee so long as (i) Indemnitor gives written
notice to Indemnitee within fifteen (15) days after Indemnitee has given
notice of the Lender Claim that Indemnitor will indemnify Indemnitee from and
against the entirety of the Lender Claim; (ii) Indemnitor provides Indemnitee
with evidence reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee that Indemnitor will have
adequate financial resources to defend against the Lender Claim and fulfill
its indemnification obligations hereunder; (iii) Indemnitee has not been
advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between
Indemnitee and Indemnitor in connection with the defense of the Lender Claim;

and expense and participate in the defense of the Lender Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

Limitations on Indemnitor. Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to the Lender
Claim without the prior written consent of Indemnitee unless such judgment,
compromise or settlement (i) provides for the payment by Indemnitor of money
as sole relief for the Lender Claimant and (ii) involves no finding or
admission of any violation of law. 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

Indemnitee's Control. If Indemnitor does not deliver to Indemnitee the notice
contemplated by Section 2.3(b) within fifteen (15) days after Indemnitee has
given notice of the Lender Claim pursuant to Section 2.3(a), or otherwise at
any time fails to conduct the defense of the Lender Claim actively and
diligently, Indemnitee may defend the Lender Claim in a good faith and
reasonable manner, and may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into

may deem appropriate (and Indemnitee need not consult with, or obtain any
consent from, Indemnitor in connection therewith).

|

Procedure for Notification. Subject to Section 2.3, to obtain indemnification
under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to Indemnitor a written request,
including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is
reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine
whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement. The delay or omission to notify Indemnitor will not relieve
Indemnitor from any liability which it may have to Indemnitee otherwise than
under this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

2.5

|

Presumption. It shall be presumed that Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for
indemnification in accordance with Section 2.3(a), and Indemnitor shall, to
the fullest extent not prohibited by law, have the burden of proof to overcome
that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or
entity of any determination contrary to that presumption. 

| 
---|--- 

2.6

Payment and Set-Off. Indemnitor shall make any indemnification payment
required under this Agreement promptly following request therefor (or, in the
event that Indemnitor elects to participate in or assume the defense of a
Lender Claim in accordance with this Section 2, promptly after any settlement
or entry of any final judgment with respect to such Lender Claim), subject to
Indemnitor's right to rebut the presumption set forth in Section 2.5.

hereby promises to pay to WGR Asset Holding Company LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("WGRAH"), or registered assigns, the principal sum of [ ]
[B]illion Dollars ($[•]) on March [ ], 20[34] (the "Maturity Date" or such

from March [•], 2019 through repayment, quarterly on each February 1, May 1,
August 1 and November 1, at a rate per annum equal to [•] percent ([•]%).

days comprised of 12 months of 30 days each.

A."Material Adverse Change" means any change occurring since December 31,
2017, in the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole that has had the effect of

any event, condition, change, occurrence or development of a state of
circumstances which a. adversely affects the oil and gas exploration and
development, gas processing and transportation or hydrocarbon marketing
industries generally, including changes in commodity prices or markets,
general market prices and legal or regulatory changes (and in each case does
not disproportionately affect the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a
single enterprise as compared to similarly situated persons), a. arises out of
general economic or industry conditions (and in each case does not
disproportionately affect the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a
single enterprise as compared to similarly situated persons), or a. arises out
of any change in generally accepted accounting principles (which does not
disproportionately affect the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a
single enterprise as compared to similarly situated persons) shall not be
considered in determining whether a Material Adverse Change has occurred.

"Note" means this [Fixed] Rate Note Due 20[ ], dated March [ ], 2019.

"Public Indenture" means the Indenture, dated as of September 19, 2006,
between the Borrower and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee.

"Specified Business Day" means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday, and
that is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by
law or executive order to close in New York, New York. 



Payment of the principal of and any such interest on this Note will be made at
the office or agency of the Company, in such coin or currency of the United
States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of
public and private debts, against surrender of this Note at the Maturity Date
of the principal thereof or any early repayment as provided herein.

B.This Note is subject to redemption, in whole or in part, on any Specified
Business Day at the election of the Company upon not less than 30 days' nor
more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to the greater of i.
100% of the principal amount to be redeemed (the "Redemption Amount") or ii.
the amount determined by the quotation agent (the "Make Whole Price")
described below under "Make Whole Calculation," plus, in each case, accrued
but unpaid interest to the redemption date; provided that, if this Note
becomes due and payable prior to the Maturity Date as a result of an
Indemnification Demand (as defined below), this Note shall be repaid in an
amount equal to the Redemption Amount as of such date, without premium or
penalty, plus accrued but unpaid interest as of such date.

In the event of redemption of this Note in part only, a new Note or Notes of
like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the
holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof and all references to "Note" herein
shall include the plural.

Make Whole Calculation

The quotation agent will determine the Make Whole Price by determining the sum
of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of the principal of,
and interest on, the Redemption Amount, not including any portion of these
payments of interest accrued as of the date on which the Redemption Amount is
to be redeemed, discounted to the date on which the Redemption Amount is to be
redeemed on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months, at the adjusted treasury rate described below plus 50 basis
points.

The quotation agent will utilize the following procedures to calculate the
adjusted treasury rate WGRAH will appoint UBS Securities LLC ("UBS") or its
successor and two or more other primary U.S. Government securities dealers in
New York City as reference dealers and the Company will appoint UBS or its
successor to act as the Company's quotation agent. If UBS or its successor is
no longer a primary U.S. Government securities dealer, WGRAH will substitute
another primary U.S. Government securities dealer in its place as a reference
dealer.

The quotation agent will select a United States Treasury security which has a
maturity comparable to the remaining maturity of the Note and which would be
used in accordance with customary financial practice to price new issues of
corporate debt securities with a maturity comparable to the remaining maturity
of the Note. The reference dealers will provide the quotation agent with the
bid and ask prices for that comparable United States Treasury security as of
5:00 p.m. on the third Specified Business Day before the redemption date. The
calculation agent will calculate the average of the bid and ask prices
provided by each reference dealer, eliminate the highest and the lowest
average reference dealer quotations and then calculate the average of the
remaining reference dealer quotations (the "Comparable Treasury Price").
However, if the calculation agent obtains fewer than three reference dealer
quotations, it will calculate the average of all the reference dealer
quotations and not eliminate any quotations. The adjusted treasury rate 



will be the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of a security whose
price, expressed as a percentage of its principal amount, is equal to the
comparable treasury price.

Upon not less than 7 Specified Business Days' notice, this Note shall be due
and payable upon demand from WGRAH if at any point, pursuant to the terms of
the Indemnification Agreement, WGRAH is required to indemnify WES GP and
otherwise perform its obligations under the Indemnification Agreement (the
"Indemnification Demand").
