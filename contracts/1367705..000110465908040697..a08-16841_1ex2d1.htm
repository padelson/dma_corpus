prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

 _1.8._ _ __Effect on Capital Stock_.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the
holders of any shares of Company

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

Common Stock or any shares of common stock, no par value, of Merger Sub (the
" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "):

  



  

### (a) Each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant
to _Section 1.8(c)_) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to $7.00, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  

### 

  

### (b) All shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and

### 

  

### (c) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned directly or
indirectly by Parent or any Subsidiary thereof, Merger Sub, Company or any
Subsidiary thereof at the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

### 

  

### (d) Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par
value, of the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall

### 

  

 _1.9._ _ __Company Stock Options and Warrant_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Company shall take, and cause the Board of Directors of Company or any
committee administering the Company Stock Plans to adopt resolutions
approving the taking of, all actions (including, without limitation,
obtaining all necessary consents and providing all necessary notices) to
provide that:

  



  

### (a) all outstanding Company Stock Options heretofore granted under the
MEDecision, Inc. Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan, whether or not then
exercisable or vested, and all outstanding Company Stock Options under the
2006 Equity Incentive Plan, other than the Company Stock Options set forth on
_Schedule 1.9_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Remaining Unvested
Options_ "), whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall cease to
represent, upon the Effective Time, a right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock and shall be converted, in settlement and cancellation thereof,
into the right to receive, immediately after the Effective Time, a lump sum
cash payment by the Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to (i) the
excess, if any, of (A) the per share Merger Consideration over (B) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
for which such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised
(the " _Option Merger Consideration_ ");

  

### 

  

### (b) the Remaining Unvested Options shall terminate as of the Effective
Time and shall cease to represent, as of the Effective Time, a right to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock, and will otherwise be treated in the
manner set forth on _Schedule 1.9_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule;

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

### (c) Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
holder of the Warrant an irrevocable notice to exercise the Warrant
simultaneously with the consummation of the Merger such that the holder
thereof receives at the Effective Time, subject to _Section 2.8_, a lump sum
cash payment from Parent or the Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to
(i) the excess of (A) the per share Merger Consideration over (B) the
exercise price per share of the Warrant, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock for which such Warrant shall not theretofore
have been exercised (the " _Warrant Merger Consideration_ ");

  

### 

  

### (d) the Company Stock Plans shall terminate, and all rights under any
provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest with respect to the capital stock or
other equity interests of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the
Warrant, shall be canceled, effective upon the Effective Time, without any
liability on the part of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement); and

  

### 

  

### (e) no Person shall have any right under the Company Stock Plans or under
any other plan, program, agreement or arrangement with respect to equity
interests of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement) at and after the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (f) Reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later
than the time of the second general employee payroll payment made by the
Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time, except to the extent
appropriate payment instructions for particular Persons are not reasonably
accessible by such time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall pay the
holders of Company Stock Options the cash payments specified in this _Section
1.9_.  No interest shall be paid or accrue on such cash payments. To the
extent the Surviving Corporation or Parent is required or entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Stock Options with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(collectively, the " _Code_ "), or any provision of any other Tax Law, the
amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, any amounts deducted in accordance with the
terms of any benefit plan (such as 401(k) plan contributions), and any
amounts deducted in accordance with applicable Law or any Order (such as
child support payments), as the case may be, shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company
Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. Company shall
cooperate with Parent, and keep Parent fully informed, with respect to all
resolutions, actions and consents that Company intends to adopt, take and
obtain in connection with the matters described in this _Section 1.9_.
Without limitation, Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all such resolutions and consents.

  

### 

  

 _1.10._ _ __Certain Adjustments_.  If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, (a) the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number of shares or different class, in each case, by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or
exchange of shares, (b) a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other
securities of Company shall be declared with a record date within such
period, (c) any other securities of Company shall

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

be declared with a record date within such period or (d) any similar event
shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (and
Company Stock Options and the Warrant) the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

  



  

# **ARTICLE II 
 CONVERSION OF SHARES**

  

# ** **

  

 _2.1._ _ __Paying Agent_.  At the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall designate, and enter into an agreement with, such bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as paying agent in the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "), which agreement shall provide that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall deposit with the Paying Agent at the
Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_, cash sufficient to effect the
payment of the Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_.

  



  

 _2.2._ _ __Payment Procedures_.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but no later than five Business Days after the Effective
Time), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock that were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ (the " _Certificates_ ") (a) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such a form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (b)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as Parent
may appoint, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably
require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, and the
Paying Agent or such other agent or agents as Parent may appoint shall
promptly pay (subject to the provisions of this _Article II_), the Merger
Consideration in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on the Merger
Consideration. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Certificate is registered, then it shall be a condition to the payment of
such Merger Consideration that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall have (A) paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or (B) established to the
satisfaction of Parent that any such Taxes either have been paid or are not
payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each
Certificate (other than a Certificate representing shares of Company Common
Stock cancelled in accordance with _Section 1.8(c)_) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the
shares of

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_.

  



  

 _2.3._ _ __No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All
consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the
terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to any
obligation of the Surviving Corporation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may
have been authorized or made with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
which remain unpaid or unsatisfied at the Effective Time, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, the Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article II_, except as otherwise provided by applicable
Law.

  



  

 _2.4._ _ __Undistributed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the funds
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.1_ that remains
undistributed to holders of Certificates on the date that is one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or its
designee, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied
with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for the Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ and this _Article II_. Any portion of the
funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.1_ that
remains unclaimed by holders of Certificates on the date that is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of
all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

 _2.5._ _ __No Liability_.  None of Parent, Merger Sub, Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective representatives
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

  



  

 _2.6._ _ __Investment of Merger Consideration_. The Paying Agent shall
invest the funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section
2.1_ as directed by Parent on a daily basis; provided, however, that such
investments shall only be in direct obligations of, or obligations directly
guaranteed by, the United States or money market funds investing solely in
the foregoing. No such gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable
to holders of Certificates pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ and this _Article
II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
the property of, and shall promptly be paid to, the Surviving Corporation. To
the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, such that
the funds available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.1_ diminish
below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration
as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or
restore the portion of such funds lost through investments so as to ensure
that such funds are, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make
such payments.

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

 _2.7._ _ __Lost Certificates_.  If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificate.

  



  

 _2.8._ _ __Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
be entitled, and shall be entitled to direct the Paying Agent, to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock (or the Warrant)
such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of any other Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock (or the Warrant) in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent.

  



  

 _2.9._ _ __Further Assurances_.  At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, all
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, all other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
all right, title and interest in, to and under all of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

 _2.10._ _ __Stock Transfer Books_.  The stock transfer books of Company
shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
thereafter on the records of Company. At or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason shall, subject to compliance with the provisions
of this _Article II_ by the holder thereof, be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented thereby.

  



  

# **ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY**

  

# ** **

  

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
after giving effect to _Section 8.14_ (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_
"), Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

  



  

 _3.1._ _ __Organization and Qualification_.  Each of Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has
full corporate or other power and authority to own, operate and lease the
properties owned or used by it and to carry on its business as and where such
is now being conducted. Each of Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction wherein the character of the properties owned
or leased by it, or the nature of its business, makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure
to be so licensed or qualified, individually or in the aggregate, would not
or would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Attached to _Schedule 3.1_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule are correct and
complete copies of the respective Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws (or
similar organizational documents) of Company and each of its Subsidiaries,
including any amendments thereto or restatements thereof, as presently in
effect.

  



  

 _3.2._ _ __Capitalization._  As of the date of this Agreement, the

commitments, Contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is
bound (a) obligating Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued,

  



  

8

exchangeable into any capital stock of or other equity interest in, Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Voting Debt, (b) obligating Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such
option, warrant, call, right, security, unit, commitment, Contract,
arrangement or undertaking or (c) giving any Person the right to receive any
economic benefit or right similar to or derived from the economic benefits
and rights occurring to holders of capital stock of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity interests of its
Subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances and
other security interests of any nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_
"). A correct and complete list of all of CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries, together
with the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary and
the percentage of each SubsidiaryÂ’s outstanding capital stock or other equity
interests owned by Company or another of its Subsidiaries, is set forth in
_Schedule 3.2_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule. A correct and complete

in the Subsidiaries, joint venture or similar entities as set forth in
_Schedule 3.2_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule, Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock, equity membership
interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity
interest in any Person. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is

plan, program, policy, commitments or arrangements that are maintained by
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any entity within the same "controlled
group" as Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the meaning of Section

any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate is obligated to contribute,
for current or former employees or directors (or dependents or beneficiaries
thereof) of Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
(collectively, the " _Employee Benefit Plans_ "), or under which the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate has or may have any liability or funding obligation.
 Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has any
current or contingent obligation to contribute to, or current or
contingent liability under, any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
(1) sponsored by any other Person, (2) that is a "multiemployer plan" (as
that term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or any other plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA, (3) that is subject to the funding requirements of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, or (4) that is a
multiple employer plan (as that term is defined in Section 413(c) of the
Code) or a multiple employer welfare arrangement (as that term is defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA). The Company has made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of (i) each Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) the two most
recent annual reports required to be filed, or such similar reports,

(iii) the most recent summary plan description, if any, and all summary of
material modifications, prepared for each Employee Benefit Plan, (iv) each

documents with respect to all Employee Benefit Plans required to be filed
with any Governmental Entity or distributed to participants have been duly
and timely filed or distributed.

### (c) The Internal Revenue Service has issued a currently effective
favorable determination, notification or opinion letter with respect to the
form of each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan"
within the meaning of Section 401 of the Code, and each trust maintained
pursuant thereto has been determined to be exempt from federal income
taxation under Section 501 of the Code by the IRS. Each such Employee Benefit
Plan has been timely amended since the date of the latest favorable
determination, notification or opinion letter to reflect changes required by
changes in (or the remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code
has not yet expired with respect to such changes in) applicable Laws. Nothing
has occurred with respect to the operation of any such Employee Benefit Plan
that is reasonably likely to cause the loss of such qualification or
exemption or the imposition of any liability (other than liabilities for
benefit claims), penalty or excise tax under ERISA or the Code or the
assertion of claims by "participants" (as that term is defined in Section
3(7) of ERISA) other than routine benefit claims. Neither Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has utilized the Employee
Plans Compliance Resolution System for any qualification failure of any

or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could subject Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any officer or director of Company or any of its

Section 4975 or to any liability under Sections 409 or 502 of ERISA.

asserting any claims against any administrator, fiduciary or sponsor thereof.
There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened
investigations by any Governmental Entity involving any Employee Benefit
Plans. There are no "leased employees" (as such term is defined in Section

### (f) All Employee Benefit Plans have been established, maintained and
administered in accordance with their terms and with all provisions of
applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code, except for instances of

Effect on Company. All contributions or premiums required to be made to, or
benefit liabilities arising under the terms of, each Employee Benefit Plan
for all periods have been made or adequately reserved for or have been
disclosed as liabilities on CompanyÂ’s financial statements as included in the
Company SEC Documents. No Employee Benefit Plan, or any insurance contract

operated in compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2005,
based on a good faith, reasonable interpretation of (i) Section 409A of the
Code, (ii) the proposed and final regulations issued thereunder, or (iii) IRS
Notice 2005-1, as modified.  Each 409A Plan has, or may prior to January 1,
2009, be amended to fully comply with the requirements of the final
regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Code. No Employee Benefit
Plan that would be a 409A Plan but for the effective date provisions
applicable to Section 409A of the Code as set forth in Section 885(d) of the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, as amended (" _AJCA_ ") has been
"materially modified" within the meaning of Section 885(d)(2)(B) of AJCA

benefits to any employee, former employee, director, consultant or other
Person, except as required by applicable Law.

### (i) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or disclosed on
_Schedule 3.14_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions

Plan; (ii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of
any such benefits; (iii) further limit or further prohibit the ability to
amend or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan; (iv) require the funding of
any trust or other funding vehicle; or (v) renew or extend the term of any

Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Affiliates after consummation of the Merger.

  

### 

  

### (j) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have made any payment in
the fiscal year in which the Merger will occur, or have a current obligation
to make or will incur an obligation as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to make any payments that will not be
deductible because of Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code. No employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates is entitled to

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company, (i) all
employer and employee contributions to each Foreign Benefit Plan required by
Law or by the terms of such Foreign Benefit Plan have been made or, if
applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices, (ii) the
fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Foreign Benefit Plan funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign Benefit Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Effective Time, with respect
to all current and former participants in such plan according to the
actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan, and no transaction contemplated
by this Agreement will cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less
than such benefit obligations, (iii) all Foreign Benefit Plans have been
maintained in accordance with their terms and all requirements of applicable
Law, (iv) each Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered has been
registered and has been maintained in good standing with the appropriate
Governmental Entities and (v) to the extent any Foreign Benefit Plan is

Company and its Subsidiaries. Any such investigations shall not affect the
representations and warranties made by Company in this Agreement. Prior to

bona fide and written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to Company by
such Person after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time that the

Company, any of its Affiliates or any of the Representatives has violated any
of the provisions of this _Section 5.5_, (B) a majority of the members of

with a nationally recognized financial advisor, that (I) such Person is
reasonably capable of consummating a Superior Proposal taking into account
the legal,

  



        
   

  



  

#### financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and
(II) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) a

Company or have the effect of prohibiting Company from satisfying its
obligations under this Agreement, and (F) at least two (2) Business Days

Company furnishes such information to Parent (to the extent such information
has not been previously delivered or made available by Company to Parent);

violated any of the provisions of this _Section 5.5_, (B) Company provides

believes that the Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to constitute a
Superior Proposal and, therefore, plans to conduct a meeting of the Board of
Directors of Company for the purpose of considering whether the Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, which notice shall be delivered to
Parent at least five Business Days prior to the date of such meeting of the
Board of Directors of Company, (C) during the five Business Day period after
Company provides Parent with the written notice described in _clause (B)_

and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time as provided in CompanyÂ’s Amended and Restated Articles
of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (the " _Charter
Documents_ ") and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as in
effect on the date hereof or the indemnification agreements entered into with

be. Without limiting the foregoing, for six years after the Effective Time,
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (or any
successor) shall contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with
respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of the
Indemnitees thereunder. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall honor all
of its indemnification obligations existing as of the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (b) After the Effective Time, each of Parent, Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any

information and testimony, and attend

as of the Effective Time, "tail" insurance coverage (" _Tail Insurance_ ")
with an extended reporting period of claims of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, with at least the same coverage and policy limits as
contained in, and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable
to those persons who are currently (and any additional persons who prior to
the Effective Time become) covered by, the CompanyÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance coverage (including excess liability directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance coverage) in force as of the date of this
Agreement (" _Current Insurance_ "). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
(i) the Tail Insurance shall only cover claims arising out of or relating to
actual or alleged wrongful acts which occurred before or at the Effective
Time and (ii) if the Tail Insurance is not available, or if the premium
payable for the Tail Insurance would exceed 250% of the annual premiums for
the Current Insurance and the Parent, after reasonable notice from Company,
reasonably determines that Company should not purchase the Tail Insurance,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall provide policies, issued by one or
more reputable insurers, which contain substantially similar coverage for six
(6) years from the Effective Time with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time (" _Alternative Insurance_ "); provided, however, that if
the annual premiums for the Alternative Insurance in any year would exceed
125% of the annual premiums (the " _Premium Cap_ ") for the Current
Insurance, the Parent and Surviving Corporation shall obtain the most
Alternative Insurance coverage available for such year for a premium equal to
the Premium Cap. If the Tail Insurance is obtained, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain such policy in full force and effect.

  

### 

  

### (d) The provisions of this _Section 5.6_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, and shall not impair any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract, under the Company
Charter Documents, or the comparable organization documents of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, under applicable Law, or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this _Section
5.6_ shall survive the Effective Time and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby indefinitely. The obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.6_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.6_ applies unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.6_ applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.6_). Parent shall
ensure that the Surviving Corporation complies with all of its obligations

or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so

of the Exchange Act with respect to Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

the party receiving such notice.

participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation against Company or
its officers or directors relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.

the assets of Company, as described in Internal Revenue Service Notice

CompanyÂ’s "Built-In Tax" as described in component one of Notice 2008-20 that
would otherwise result from the disposition of the Sold Company Assets is
offset or avoided or not paid, then Parent shall promptly notify such person
as Company shall designate prior to Closing of such disposition(s), provided,
however, that no such notice shall be required if any Internal Revenue
Service Notice or other administrative pronouncement shall exempt or cause
the Merger to be excluded from the purview of Notice 2001-16.
