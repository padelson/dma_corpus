dispute, the Firm will have reasonable access to all documents, records, work papers, facilities and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries necessary to make its determination. Each party will be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Firm any material such party deems relevant to the determination and will have a continuing opportunity to discuss the matter and its position with the Firm, but no such presentation of materials or communication will be on an ex parte basis and
each party will be afforded access to copies of all materials presented by each other party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Firm will be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and Representative, on the other hand, in the same proportion
that the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally determined by the Firm) bears to the total amount of disputed items submitted. For example, if the Representative
submits a Notice of Disagreement for $1,000, and if Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Representative, and if the Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Representative $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
