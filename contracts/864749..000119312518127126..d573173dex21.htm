NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual

herein, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.01 _The Merger_. On and subject to the terms and conditions contained
herein, and in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company
surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer (the Company, as

herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

1.02 _Filing of Merger Certificate; Effective Time_. At the Closing, subject
to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in _ARTICLE_ __ _ VII_,

relevant provisions of the DGCL, and (ii) the Company and Merger Sub will
cause such executed Certificate of Merger to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL, and the Merger
will be effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may
be agreed in writing by Buyer and the Company and specified therein (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

1.03 _Effect of the Merger; Further Assurances_.

 

(a) The Merger will have the effects provided in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. If,
at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation determines
that any further documents or acts are necessary to vest in the Surviving
Corporation the title to any properties, rights, privileges, powers or
franchises of the Constituent Corporations acquired in the Merger or to
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation
and its officers and directors will execute and deliver all such documents and
do all such acts, and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
are fully authorized in the name of the Constituent Corporations to take any
and all such action after the Effective Time solely for the purposes set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 1.03_.

 



6 (b) Subject to compliance with _Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_, at the Effective
Time the certificate of incorporation of the Company will, by operation of
law and without any further action by any Person, be amended and restated in
its entirety to contain the provisions set forth in the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except for any references to the name, incorporator or original directors of
Merger Sub), and as so amended and restated will be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended or
repealed in accordance with the provisions thereof, and applicable Law.

(c) Subject to compliance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_, at the Effective
Time, the bylaws of the Company will, by operation of law and without any
further action by any Person, be amended and restated in their entirety to
contain the provisions set forth in the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for any references to the name
of Merger Sub), and as so amended and restated will be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended or repealed in accordance with
the provisions thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, and applicable Law.

(d) The directors of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and will hold
office from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, their earlier
resignation or removal, or as otherwise provided by applicable Law.

 

(e) The officers of the Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the
Effective Time, will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and
will hold office from the Effective Time until their successors are duly
elected and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, their earlier
resignation or removal, or as otherwise provided by applicable Law.

1.04 _Conversion of Shares; Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of any of the securities described below:

 

(a) Each share of the common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one (1)
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Capital Stock cancelled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.04(c)_ and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the
right to receive the applicable Stock Consideration, without interest, and
will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist.

(c) Each share of Capital Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each
share of Capital Stock owned or held, directly or indirectly, by the Company
or by Buyer, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries, in each case,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and retired and
will cease to exist without any conversion thereof and no payment of cash or
any other consideration will be made with respect thereto.

 



7 (d) Each share of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive the applicable
Closing Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, and will automatically be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist.

 

(e) Each unexercised Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that becomes either a Vested Option at the Closing or is deemed to be a
Vested Option following the Closing (in accordance with the terms of _Section_
__ _ 1.07(g)_) will, as of the Effective Time, be converted into the right to
receive the applicable Option Consideration (subject to reduction for any
applicable Contingent Option Allocations) and will automatically be cancelled
and retired and will cease to exist. Each Option that does not otherwise
become a Vested Option as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence
shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist effective as of the
Effective Time, with no consideration therefor. The amount of cash each
Optionholder is entitled to receive with respect to his or her Vested Options
shall be rounded down to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash
amounts for all Options held by such Optionholder.

1.05  _Pre-Closing Merger Consideration Estimate_.

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
will prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) an estimated unaudited balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Adjustment Calculation Time (for
the avoidance of doubt, taking into account any actions taken pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.01(d)_) (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii)
a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth a
calculation of (1) the estimated Closing Net Working Capital (the "
_Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (2) the estimated Closing Cash
(the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ "), (3) the estimated Closing Indebtedness
(the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), (4) the estimated Transaction
Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), (5) the Companys
calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration derived from the foregoing,
(6) the Closing Stock Payment payable at the Closing to each Stockholder in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.05(b)_, and (7) the Closing Option Payment
payable at the Closing to each Optionholder in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.05(c)_. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Closing Statement
will be prepared, and the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Estimated
Closing Cash, Estimated Closing Indebtedness, and Estimated Transaction
Expenses will be determined, in each case, in good faith, in accordance with
_Exhibit B-1_ (the " _Accounting Principles_ "). Following the delivery of the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Estimated Closing Statement, the Company
shall, upon the written request of Buyer, provide Buyer and its accountants
with reasonable supporting documentation for the calculations included therein
and make the relevant financial records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating thereto reasonably available to Buyer and its accountants in
connection therewith (subject to execution of any customary work paper access
letter required by them).

 

(b) The portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration each Stockholder will be
entitled to receive at the Closing to be set forth on the Estimated Closing
Statement (the " _Closing Stock Payment_ ") will equal, (i) with respect to
holders of Common Stock, the product of (A) Closing Common Stock Per Share
Merger Consideration _multiplied_ by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock
held by such Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time that were
converted in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.04(b)_, and (ii) with respect
to holders of Preferred Stock, the product of (A) Closing Preferred Stock Per
Share Merger Consideration _multiplied_ by (B) the number of shares of
Preferred Stock held by such Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective
Time that were converted in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.04(d)_.

(c) The portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration each Optionholder will
be entitled to receive at the Closing to be set forth on the Estimated
Closing Statement (the " _Closing Option Payment_ "), in respect of his or her
Options converted in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.04(e)_ will equal the
product of (i) Closing Option Per Share Merger Consideration _multiplied_ by
(ii) the number of shares of Common Stock corresponding to such Optionholders
Vested Options at the Effective Time, based on the Estimated
Merger Consideration.

 



8 1.06 _Closing Payments_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause Merger Sub to, deposit with the
Paying Agent the aggregate Closing Stock Payments payable to the Stockholders
as set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Paying Agent no
later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) At the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause Merger Sub to, deliver the
aggregate Closing Option Payments payable to the Optionholders as set forth
in the Estimated Closing Statement and the Merger Consideration Allocation
Schedule by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. The Company will distribute to the Optionholders, as soon as
commercially practicable but in no event later than the first scheduled
payroll of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the first full payroll cycle
following the Closing, their respective Closing Option Payments ( _provided_
, that the amounts payable to any Optionholder who has executed a Retention
Arrangement will be reduced by such Optionholders Contingent Option
Allocation and retained by the Company), subject to any applicable Tax
withholding pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.09_. After the Closing, Buyer shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to make timely payment to the appropriate
taxing authority or authorities of any amounts withheld from payment to the
Optionholders under this _Section_ __ _ 1.06_.

(c) At the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause Merger Sub to, deliver:

(i) the Adjustment Escrow Deposit Amount to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an escrow account designated by the Escrow
Agent (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ "); and

(ii) the Indemnity Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an escrow account designated by the Escrow
Agent (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ "),

 

in the case of each such account, as designated no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date and established pursuant to the terms of an
escrow agreement to be dated as of the Closing Date and substantially in the
form of _Exhibit C_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), by and among Buyer, the
Company, the Representative and the Escrow Agent.

 

(d) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to pay, to the
Representative, the Representative Holdback Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Representative at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(e) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to pay, on behalf
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all Estimated Transaction Expenses to
such Persons as they are owed by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to accounts designated by the Company at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

 

(f) At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to pay, on behalf
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all amounts required to be paid under
the Payoff Letters delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ in order to
fully discharge the Indebtedness owed to the Persons thereunder, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated in such
Payoff Letters.

 



9 (g) In accordance with the paying agent agreement to be dated as of the
Closing Date and substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ (the " _Paying
Agent Agreement_ "), the Paying Agent will act as Buyers and the
Representatives agent in delivering to each Stockholder its respective
Closing Stock Payment in return for the Certificates which, prior to the
Effective Time, represented shares of Capital Stock (other than shares of
Capital Stock cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.04(c)_ and Dissenting
Shares), as well as any amounts owed to such Stockholders pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.07_. At or after the Effective Time, upon surrender of
Certificates and delivery by a Stockholder of a duly executed letter of
transmittal substantially in the form of  _Exhibit_ __ _ E_ (the " _Letter
of Transmittal_ ") to the Paying Agent, (i) the Paying Agent will pay each
such Stockholder the Closing Stock Payment to which such Stockholder is
entitled under  _Section_ __ _ 1.05_ and (ii) each Stockholder will be
irrevocably entitled to receive the portion of any amount payable under
_Section_ __ _ 1.07(g)_ with respect to the shares of Common Stock (if any)
held by such Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Stock
Consideration payable to a Stockholder will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by such
Stockholder in the Letter of Transmittal. Each such Stockholder that makes
the deliveries to the Paying Agent required by this Agreement, the Letter of
Transmittal and the Paying Agent Agreement at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date will be paid his, her or its Closing Stock Payment
on the same Business Day as the Effective Time. Each such Stockholder that
makes the deliveries to the Paying Agent required by this Agreement, the
Letter of Transmittal and the Paying Agent Agreement thereafter will be paid
his, her or its Closing Stock Payment as soon as possible after delivery
thereof is made (but in any event no later than two (2) Business Days after
the date such delivery thereof is made).

 

(h) If any Certificate has been or is claimed to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming that a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent, the delivery of such indemnity by such Person as
is reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will deliver
to such Person in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate or
instrument representing shares of Capital Stock the proper amount of the Stock
Consideration to which they are entitled hereunder, subject to the other
deliveries required by this  _Section_ __ _ 1.06_.

(i) At any time that is more than one (1) year after the Effective Time, Buyer
may cause the Paying Agent to pay over to the Surviving Corporation any
portion of the Stock Consideration (including any earnings thereon) that had
been delivered to the Paying Agent and that has not been disbursed to
Stockholders as of such first anniversary (other than any amounts then
subject to dispute). After the Paying Agent makes such payments to the
Surviving Corporation, all former Stockholders will be entitled to look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat and other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the cash payable upon surrender of their Certificates pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Paying Agent will have no further obligation under this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.06_ in its capacity as such. None of the Surviving
Corporation, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Representative or the Paying Agent will be
liable to any Person in respect of amounts paid to a public official to the
extent required under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 



10 1.07 _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Following the Closing
Date, the Estimated Merger Consideration will be adjusted as set forth below:

(a) Buyer will prepare and deliver to the Representative within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Adjustment Calculation Time (for the avoidance of
doubt, taking into account any actions taken pursuant to _Section _ _5.01(d)_
) (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth a calculation of (1) Closing Net Working Capital,
(2) Closing Cash, (3) Closing Indebtedness, (4) the Transaction Expenses, (5)
Buyers calculation of the Final Merger Consideration derived from the
foregoing, and (6) with respect to each of the foregoing, the changes in such
amounts from the corresponding amounts on the Estimated Closing Statement.
The Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement will be prepared, and Closing
Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and Transaction
Expenses will be determined, in each case, in good faith, in accordance with
the Accounting Principles. The Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement (i)
will not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase
or other accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as
a consequence of the Transactions, and (ii) will be based on facts and
circumstances as they exist as of the Adjustment Calculation Time and will
exclude the effect of any act, decision or event occurring on or after
the Closing. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement and calculating Final Merger
Consideration is solely to (x) accurately measure the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and Transaction Expenses and (y)
measure the difference in Closing Net Working Capital from Target Net Working
Capital, and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of
different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, reserves classifications or estimation methodologies for the
purpose of calculating Final Merger Consideration than were used in the
calculation of Estimated Merger Consideration.

 

(b) On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following Buyers delivery of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, the Representative will give
Buyer a written notice stating in reasonable detail the Representatives
objections (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Statement, if any. During such 30-day period, and any period of
dispute thereafter with respect to such Closing Balance Sheet and/or Closing
Statement, subject to reasonable nondisclosure obligations, Buyer will, and
will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide the
Representative and its Advisors reasonable access during reasonable hours to
the books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents), supporting data, facilities, and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including Company personnel responsible for accounting and
finance and senior management) and, subject to execution of any customary work
paper access letters required by them, the Companys Advisors and their work
papers, and (ii) otherwise cooperate with and assist the Representative and
its Advisors in connection with such review. Any determination set forth on
the Closing Statement which is not objected to in the Notice of Disagreement
will be deemed acceptable to the Representative, and will be final and
binding upon all parties upon delivery of the Notice of Disagreement. If the
Representative does not deliver to Buyer a Notice of Disagreement within such
30-day period, then the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses will be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties
as of the expiration of such 30-day period, and the Final Merger Consideration
set forth in the Closing Statement will constitute the Final Merger
Consideration for all purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.07_.

(c) Following Buyers receipt of any Notice of Disagreement, the
Representative and Buyer will discuss in good faith to resolve the disputed
matters set forth therein, and upon any such resolution, the Closing Balance
Sheet and Closing Statement will be updated and prepared in accordance with
the agreement of Buyer and the Representative. Any written resolution
executed by Buyer and the Representative during such thirty (30) day period
following Buyers receipt of a Notice of Disagreement as to any item
identified in the Notice of Disagreement will be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties.

 



11 (d) In the event that the Representative and Buyer fail to agree on any of
the Representatives proposed adjustments set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement within thirty (30) days after Buyer receives the Notice of
Disagreement, the Representative and Buyer agree to jointly select a
nationally recognized accounting firm, and use their reasonable best efforts
to cause such accounting firm, within 45 days immediately following such first
30-day period, to make the final written determination of all matters which
remain in dispute that were included in the Notice of Disagreement. If, Buyer
and the Representative cannot agree on an accounting firm within fifteen (15)
days after such first 30-day period, each of Buyer and the Representative
will promptly select a nationally recognized accounting firm and such two
accounting firms will designate a third nationally recognized accounting firm
that neither presently is, nor in the past three years has been, engaged by
either party. The accounting firm so agreed to by Buyer and the
Representative or the third accounting firm so selected by the two accounting
firms in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Firm_ ". Buyer and the Representative will mutually
instruct the Firm to, and the Firm will, make a final determination of the
items included in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (to the
extent such amounts are in dispute) solely in accordance with this Agreement.
Buyer and the Representative will execute a customary engagement letter and
will cooperate with the Firm during the term of its engagement. Buyer and the
Representative will instruct the Firm not to, and the Firm will not, assign a
value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other hand,
or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one
hand, or the Representative, on the other hand. Buyer and the Representative
will also instruct the Firm to, and the Firm will, make its determination
based solely on written submissions by Buyer and the Representative that are
in accordance with this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent
review). The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the resulting
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and
Transaction Expenses, in each case, as determined by the Firm in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 1.07(c)_, will be final, binding and conclusive on
the parties on the date the Firm delivers its final determination in writing
to Buyer and the Representative, and, subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.15_,
_Section_ __ _ 11.16_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.17_, each of the parties hereto
will be entitled to enforce such determination in a court of
competent jurisdiction. The Firm will provide a written report to Buyer and
the Representative, if requested by either of them, which sets forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the Firms final determination. In connection
with the resolution of any dispute, the Firm will have reasonable access to
all documents, records, work papers, facilities and personnel of the Company
and its Subsidiaries necessary to make its determination. Each party will be
afforded the opportunity to present to the Firm any material such party deems
relevant to the determination and will have a continuing opportunity to
discuss the matter and its position with the Firm, but no such presentation of
materials or communication will be on an ex parte basis and each party will
be afforded access to copies of all materials presented by each other party.
The fees, costs and expenses of the Firm will be allocated between Buyer, on
the one hand, and Representative, on the other hand, in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to
the Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally determined
by the Firm) bears to the total amount of disputed items submitted. For
example, if the Representative submits a Notice of Disagreement for $1,000,
and if Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Representative,
and if the Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Representative
$300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Firm will be
allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the
Representative.

(e) The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the resulting
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and
Transaction Expenses (as revised to reflect the resolution of any disputed
matters in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 1.07_) will be deemed to be
final, binding and conclusive, upon the earliest of (i) the failure of the
Representative to provide a Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30) days
after the Representative receives the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.07(b)_, (ii) the resolution in writing
of all disputes set forth in the Notice of Disagreement pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 1.07(c)_ by Buyer and the Representative, or (iii) the
resolution of all disputes set forth in the Notice of Disagreement by the Firm
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.07(d)_.

 



12 (f) Within two (2) Business Days following the final determination of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 1.07(e) _(such date, the " _Settlement Date_ ") _:_

 

(i) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration (such excess, the " _Excess Amount_ "), Buyer and the
Representative will deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
cause the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer (or its designee), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the Excess Amount from the Adjustment
Escrow Funds. In the event that at such time the Excess Amount is less than
the Adjustment Escrow Funds (such shortfall, the " _Remaining Adjustment
Escrow Funds_ "), Buyer and the Representative will simultaneously with
delivery of the instructions in the immediately foregoing sentence deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to
pay the Remaining Adjustment Escrow Funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account
to the Representative (or its designee). The Adjustment Escrow Account is
Buyers and Merger Subs sole and exclusive source of recovery for any Excess
Amount owing to Buyer, Merger Sub or, following the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation hereunder.

 

(ii) If the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration (such excess, the " _Adjustment Amount_ "), then (i) Buyer will
make payment of the Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to the Representative (or its designee), and (ii) Buyer and
the Representative will deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to make payment of the Adjustment
Escrow Funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account to the Representative (or its
designee). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Adjustment
Amount exceed an amount equal to $10,000,000.

(g) When the Final Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.07(e)_, the Representative will in good faith compute or
re-compute, as the case may be, (i) the number of Vested Options, (ii) the
Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares, (iii) the Aggregate Option
Exercise Price, (iv) the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration, (v) the Final
Common Stock Merger Consideration, (vi) the Final Common Stock Per Share
Merger Consideration, (vii) the Final Option Per Share Merger Consideration,
and (viii) the appropriate amount payable to each Stockholder and
Optionholder based on the foregoing from the Remaining Adjustment Escrow
Funds, the Adjustment Amount and the Representative Holdback Amount, taking
into account amounts previously received by such Stockholders and
Optionholders as Closing Stock Payments or Closing Option Payments, in each
case, in accordance with this Agreement and the terms of the Option Plan (and,
for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.07(g)_, making such calculation as
though all Closing Option Payments had been made without regard to reductions
under any Retention Arrangement). Promptly thereafter, the Representative will
notify the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent, as applicable, of such
calculations and the amount that should be distributed by them to each
Stockholder and to the Surviving Corporation on behalf of each Optionholder
based upon the calculations and re-calculations contemplated by the
immediately preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, each Stockholder
and Optionholder will receive the difference between (x) the amounts payable
to such Stockholder or Optionholder based upon the calculations and re-
calculations contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.07(g)_ and (y) the Closing
Stock Payment or Closing Option Payment received by such Stockholder or
Optionholder, as applicable (for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 1.07(g)_,
making such calculation as though all Closing Option Payments had been made
without regard to reductions under any Retention Arrangement). The
Representative, the Escrow Agent, and the Paying Agent, as applicable, will
distribute such amounts, as applicable, in accordance with the written
instructions so received from the Representative. If, at the time of
the calculation of Final Adjusted Merger Consideration, the Representative
determines to retain funds in the Representative Holdback Amount under
_Section_ __ _ 11.18(b)_, and at any time and from time to time thereafter
determines a portion of such funds should be distributed to the Stockholders
and Optionholders, then at each such time, the Representative will in good
faith determine the appropriate amounts to be paid to the Stockholders and
Optionholders from the Representative Holdback Amount and will cause such
amounts to be paid from the Representative Holdback Amount to the Stockholders
and to the Surviving Corporation on behalf of the Optionholders. As promptly
as practicable following the receipt of funds for the Optionholders and, in
any event, no later than the next scheduled payroll of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Company will distribute to the Optionholders any payments
received on their behalf under this  _Section_ __ _ 1.07(g)_. None of the
Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Buyer will have
any liability or obligation to any Stockholder or Optionholder or the
Representative for any distribution made in accordance with the instructions
of the Representative pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.07(g)_.

 



13 (h) The parties hereto agree that any payment made pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.07_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the aggregate
consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

1.08 _Appraisal Rights_. Each share of Capital Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a Person
who, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, (i) has not voted in favor of
the Merger or consented thereto in writing or executed an enforceable waiver
of appraisal rights (whether before or after the date of this Agreement) and
(ii) has properly demanded appraisal of such share of Capital Stock, and not
effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to perfect their rights to appraisal,
will not, at the Effective Time, be converted into the right to receive
any portion of the Stock Consideration and instead will be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist and shall represent only the right to receive
payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto as provided by the
DGCL, unless and until the holder of any such share has failed to perfect or
has effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, in which case such share will thereupon be deemed, as
of the Effective Time, to have been cancelled and retired and to have ceased
to exist and been converted into the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with _ARTICLE_ __ _ I_, without interest, in
accordance with this Agreement, the Stock Consideration. From and after the
Effective Time, no Stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be
entitled to vote his, her or its shares of Capital Stock for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on his, her or its shares
(except dividends or other distributions payable to Stockholders of record at
a date prior to the Effective Time or dividends that accrued thereon prior to
the Effective Time). Any shares of Capital Stock for which appraisal
rights have been properly exercised, and not subsequently withdrawn, lost or
failed to be perfected, in each case, in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
1.08_ and the DGCL, are referred to in this Agreement as "
_Dissenting Shares_." The Company will give Buyer prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, including any Stockholders
notice of their intent to demand payment pursuant to the DGCL that the Company
receives, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company.

1.09 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Merger Consideration, and any other amount otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld by any
applicable Tax Law. Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company,
or the Paying Agent, as applicable, will remit any withheld amounts to the
applicable Tax authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
timely remitted in full to the applicable Tax authority, such withheld amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. In
the event that Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or
the Paying Agent determines that withholding from the Merger Consideration is
required under applicable Tax Law and permitted under this Agreement (other
than withholding with respect to Options), Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or
the Paying Agent will so notify the recipient of such payment at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date or any subsequent date that the
applicable payment is to be made to provide such recipient with opportunity
to provide any form or documentation or take such other steps in order to
avoid such withholding. If Buyer, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or the Paying Agent withholds any amount from the Merger
Consideration, or any other amount otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, paid to any Stockholder or Optionholder which it was not required
to withhold, it will promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days
after demand therefor (including wire transfer information as applicable),
remit to the Stockholder or Optionholder thereof such amount wrongly withheld.

 



14 1.10 _Merger Consideration Allocation Schedule_. No later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company will deliver to Buyer a
spreadsheet setting forth (A) the name of each Stockholder and Optionholder as
of the Closing Date, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock and
Preferred Stock (as applicable) and stock certificate numbers of Common Stock
and Preferred Stock (as applicable) held by such Stockholder as of the
Effective Time and/or the number of Options held by such Optionholder as of
the Effective Time, and (C) the portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration
payable to such Stockholder and Optionholder in accordance with the provisions
hereof including, without limitation, _Sections 1.05(b)_ and _1.05(c)_ as of
the Closing Date (such spreadsheet, the " _Merger Consideration Allocation
Schedule_ "). Buyer and Merger Sub may rely on the Merger Consideration
Allocation Schedule, and in no event will Buyer or Merger Sub have any
liability to any holder of Capital Stock or Options or other Person on
account of payments made in accordance with the Merger Consideration
Allocation Schedule.

3.11_, except, in each case, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,

any Governmental Body to Buyer or Merger Sub related to or in connection with
the Transactions; and (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge threatened in writing against,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting Buyer, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.04_ or that
relate to the consummation of the Transactions.

6.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_), Buyer and
Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective Affiliates and Advisors to,
(i) use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Transactions to be
consummated as promptly as practicable and (ii) not take any action intended
to, or that would reasonably be expected to, prevent, impede or delay the
Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, the "reasonable best efforts" of
Buyer and Merger Sub will not require Buyer, Merger Sub or any of its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Advisors to pay any fee, penalty or other
consideration to obtain any license, permit, consent,
approval, authorization, qualification or waiver of a third party (other than
a Governmental Body) required under any contract to which Buyer, Merger Sub or
its Subsidiaries is a party or is bound for the consummation of the
Transactions.

 

6.05 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
other agreement, from the Closing Date through the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Closing Date, Buyer will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) and former officer, director,
employee, manager, managing member, member, partner (general or limited),
fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "
_Indemnified Person_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the Indemnified Person is or was an officer, director, employee, manager,
managing member, partner (general or limited), fiduciary or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Closing (including this Agreement and the Transactions),
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such action,
suit, claim, investigation or proceeding, (x) each Indemnified Person will be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any action,
suit, claim, investigation or proceeding from Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Person of a request
therefor; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or other
applicable Law and by the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited
liability company agreement or operating agreement (or equivalent
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof, (y) neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates will
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding
or threatened action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding in
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Person hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such
action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding (including all attorneys
fees and expenses) or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents and (z) the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates will reasonably cooperate in the
defense of any such matter.

 



44 (b) For a period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date, Buyer will
procure that the Surviving Corporation will not, and will not permit any of
the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in such Persons certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited
liability company agreement or operating agreement (or equivalent
organizational documents), or in any agreement, relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of, or advancement of expenses to, any Indemnified Person as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time in any manner adverse to
any Indemnified Person, and the Surviving Corporation will cause all such
provisions to be observed by their Subsidiaries, it being the intent of the
parties that any Indemnified Person will continue to be entitled to
such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law.

(c) At or prior to the Closing, the Surviving Corporation will obtain,
maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming the
Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least
six (6) years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors liability and employment practices insurance in an
amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys and its Subsidiaries
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or before
the Closing Date; _provided_ that, in the event that any claim is brought
under any such policy before the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date,
such insurance policies will be maintained until final disposition thereof.
the Surviving Corporation will not, and will cause their Subsidiaries to not,
cancel or change such insurance policies in any respect. One half of the cost
of such "tail" insurance policies will be treated as a Transaction Expense
hereunder, with the other half to be paid by Buyer.

 

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of the respective successors or assigns of the foregoing (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties, rights or assets to any Person, then, in each case, the
successors and assigns of such Persons or properties, rights or assets, as
the case may be, must expressly assume in writing and be bound by the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ as a condition of
succession of assignment.

 

(e) This _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ is intended to be for the benefit of each of
the Indemnified Persons and may be enforced by any such Indemnified Person as
if such Indemnified Person were a party to this Agreement. The obligations of
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ will not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person
to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ applies without the consent of such
affected Person.

(f) Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, on behalf of themselves and their
Subsidiaries, knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and
agree, that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ and
the indemnification contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ require
performance after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law and will survive the Closing for twenty (20) years (or if earlier, when
no obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ remain) and will not be
subject to any of the survival or exclusive remedy provisions of _Section_ __
_ 11.01_.

 

6.06 _Contact with Business Relations_. Without limiting the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 5.02_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.03,_ Buyer and Merger Sub
acknowledge that they are not authorized to, and agree that they will not, and
they will not permit any member of the Buyer Group to, contact any officer,
director, employee, customer, supplier, service provider, lessee, lessor,
Stockholder, Optionholder, lender, noteholder or other material business
relation of the Company or its Subsidiaries before the Closing with respect to
the Company, its Subsidiaries, their businesses and the Transactions, in each
case, without receiving the prior written consent of the Company before each
such contact, which will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

 



45 6.07 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when due
thereafter, all gross receipts, transfer, gains, property, sales, use,
documentary, registration, excise, stamp, and any other similar Taxes and all
applicable conveyance fees, recording charges and other similar fees and
charges applicable to, arising out of or imposed upon the Transactions,
whether imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries or imposed on any holder
of Capital Stock or Options resulting from the Transactions (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") will be paid by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation. Buyer
will prepare any Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes, and the
Representative will cooperate with Buyer in the preparation and filing of such
Tax Returns.

 

(b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other party hereto, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns, any Tax audits, Tax proceedings or other Tax-related claims. Such
cooperation will include providing records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such matters, making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explaining any
materials provided pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.07(b)_.

(c) None of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their Affiliates will
make any election under Sections 338 or 336(e) of the Code (or any similar
provision under state, local or foreign Law) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d) _Responsibility for pre-Closing Tax Returns._

 

(i) Buyer will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to timely prepare and
file all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries due or required to
be prepared and filed after the Closing Date in respect of periods ending on
or before, or which include the Closing Date. Not less than twenty (20) days
in the case of such income Tax Returns or ten (10) days in the case of such
other Tax Returns prior to the due date of any such Tax Return, Buyer will
provide the Representative with a substantially final draft of the Tax Return
(the " _Draft Return_ "). The Representative and its accountants have
the right to review the Draft Return and any working papers relating to its
preparation. Within fifteen (15) days after the date that the Representative
receives the Draft Return, but in no event less than five (5) days prior to
the due date of any such Tax Return, the Representative will advise Buyer in
writing that it either agrees with the Draft Return or does not agree with the
Draft Return, in which case the Representative will set out, in reasonable
detail, the basis for such disagreement. In the event that the Representative
and Buyer fail to agree to the Draft Return, the Representative and Buyer will
attempt to resolve such disagreement; _provided,_ _however_ , that if they
fail to reach agreement, the Representative and Buyer agree to jointly select
a nationally recognized accounting firm, and use their reasonable best efforts
to cause such accounting firm, to make the final written determination of all
matters which remain in dispute in respect of the Draft Return. If, Buyer and
the Representative cannot agree on an accounting firm within five (5) days
after such first 15-day period, each of Buyer and the Representative will
promptly select a nationally recognized accounting firm and such two
accounting firms will designate a third nationally recognized accounting firm
that neither presently is, nor in the past three years has been, engaged by
either party. The accounting firm so agreed to by Buyer and the
Representative, or the third accounting firm so selected by the two accounting
firms in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Accounting Firm_ _"_. Buyer and the Representative will
mutually instruct the Accounting Firm to, and the Accounting Firm will, make a
final written determination of all matters which remain in dispute in respect
of the Draft Return. Buyer and the Representative will execute a customary
engagement letter and will cooperate with the Accounting Firm during the term
of its engagement. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in making any
such determination will be borne 50% by the Equityholders and 50% by
Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions in this
Agreement, Buyer has the right to timely file any Tax Return that it is
required to prepare and file pursuant to this Agreement and such Tax Return
may be amended, if necessary, after the final resolution of the disputed
items by the Accounting Firm.

 



46 (ii) Buyer will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to timely pay or cause
to be paid all Taxes shown as due on the Tax Returns prepared in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 6.07(d)(i)_.

(e) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), (i) in the case of real and personal
property Taxes and any other similar Taxes which are imposed on a periodic
basis, the amount of any Taxes for the portion of such Straddle Period
through the end of the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period
Portion_") will be determined by multiplying the amount of such Taxes for
that entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the Pre Closing Straddle Period Portion and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in that Straddle Period,
and (ii) in the case of income or other Taxes, the amount of any such Taxes
for the portion of such Straddle Period through the end of the Closing Date
will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity or any non-U.S. entity in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest will be deemed
to terminate at such time).

(f) Any income Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against income Tax
to which Buyer or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries become
entitled, that relate to income Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or
before the Closing Date will be for the account of the Equityholders, 
_provided_ , _however_ , Buyer will not be required to pay over to the
Equityholders any such refund or the amount of any such credit up to the
amount of any Tax asset specifically accrued for that purpose in the final
determination of Closing Net Working Capital and taken into account in
determining the Merger Consideration.

6.08 _Waiver of Required Financial Information of Waterfall_. Buyer will use
reasonable best efforts to cause its providers of debt and/or equity financing
to waive any requirement for the Company to provide the Required Financial
Information of Waterfall prior to Closing, and from and after the time the
Required Financial Information of Waterfall is no longer required to be
delivered prior to Closing (the " _RFI Removal_ "), the Company will
automatically and without further action cease to have any obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 5.09(d)_ with respect to the delivery of the Required
Financial Information of Waterfall and the last sentence of such covenant
shall have no force or effect for purposes of this Agreement.

50 9.02 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) _Compensation and Benefits_. Effective as of the Closing and continuing
through December 31, 2018, Buyer will, or will cause its Affiliates, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide to all employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately following the Closing (the "
_Retained Employees_ ") compensation (other than equity compensation) and
benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements and policies that, in the
aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided to the Retained Employees
immediately before the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, for a
period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing through December 31,
2018, Buyer will or will cause its Affiliates, the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries to provide to each Retained Employee who remains in the
employment of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries): (i) a base salary or wage rate and
annual cash bonus opportunity at least equal to the base salary or wage rate
and bonus opportunity in effect for such Retained Employee immediately before
the Closing, and (ii) termination and severance benefits that are no less
favorable on an individual basis than the termination and severance benefits
that would have been applicable to such Retained Employee immediately before
the Closing, taking into account each such Company Employees additional
period of service and rate of base pay or wages and bonus target at Buyer or
its Affiliates following the Closing. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _
9.02(a)_ will obligate Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to continue (and will not prevent Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from modifying or terminating)
the employment of any such Retained Employee or impact the at-will employment
nature of the Company and its Subsidiaries employees who are providing
services in the United States. Buyer will be solely responsible for complying
with the requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section
4980B of the Code for any individual who is an "MandA qualified beneficiary" as
defined in Treas. Reg. Sec. 54.4980B-9e.

(b) _Employee Service Credit_. Buyer (i) will give, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to give, each Retained Employee credit under any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, arrangement or policy of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including retirement, vacation, sick leave and
severance policies but excluding equity), for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and entitlement to amount of vacation, sick leave and severance
benefits for the Retained Employees service with the Company and its
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date to the same extent such service was
recognized under a similar Plan or Foreign Benefit Plan, except in each case,
to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative benefits, (ii) will
allow such Retained Employees to participate in each plan providing
welfare benefits without regard to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting
periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or limitations not
imposed on the Retained Employee by the corresponding Plans or Foreign Benefit
Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) if any of the Plans
that provide welfare benefits are terminated prior to the end of the plan year
that includes the Closing Date, Buyer will cause each Retained Employee to be
credited with any expenses that were covered by the Plans during such plan
year for purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays and other applicable
limits under any replacement plans.

 

(c) _Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays_. Buyer will cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue to credit to each Retained Employee all vacation and
personal holiday pay that the Retained Employee is entitled to use but has not
used as of the Closing Date, including any earned vacation or personal holiday
pay to be used in future years, and will assume all liability for the
payment of such amounts.

(d) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions contained in this _Section_
__ _ 9.02_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ will (i) confer any rights or
remedies upon any employee or former employee of the Company, any Retained
Employee or upon any other Person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, (ii) be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
or (iii) subject to compliance with the other provisions of this _Section_ __
_ 9.02_, alter or limit Buyers or the Surviving Corporations or any of its
Subsidiaries ability to amend, modify or terminate any specific benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time.

later than five (5) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, file
with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United
States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ "), any notification form required
pursuant to the HSR Act for the Transactions, which form will specifically
request early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act.
Each of the Company and the Buyer Parties will furnish to each others counsel
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request
in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is
necessary under the HSR Act and will provide any supplemental information
requested by any Governmental Body as promptly as reasonably practicable. The
Company and the Buyer Parties will use all reasonable best efforts to comply
as promptly as reasonably practicable with any requests made for any
additional information in connection with such filings. Buyer will be
responsible for payment of the applicable filing fee required in connection
with such filings.

(b) Subject to the immediately following sentence, the Company and the Buyer
Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain any HSR
Approval for the consummation of the Transactions and will keep each other
apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, any Governmental Body and will
comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. The Buyer Parties will take,
and will cause their Affiliates to take, any and all steps required to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Body or any other Person so as to enable the parties to
expeditiously close the Transactions, including (i) opposing any motion or
action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction or order against
or preventing or delaying the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) entering
into a consent decree, consent agreement or other agreement or arrangement
containing Buyers or the Surviving Corporations agreement to hold separate,
license, sell and/or divest (pursuant to such terms as may be required by any
Governmental Body) such assets or businesses of Buyer and its Affiliates after
the Closing(including entering into customary ancillary agreements relating to
any such sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such assets or
businesses), and (iii) agreeing to such limitations on conduct or actions of
members of Buyer and its Affiliates after the Closing as may be required in
order to obtain satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 7.01(a)_ before the End Date; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Buyer Parties will not be required to take or
agree to take or commit to take any action (including the actions described
in clauses (i) - (iii) above) or to limit or agree to limit its freedom of
action or that of the Company or any Subsidiary, division or Affiliate of
either in any respect to the extent such action, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect that is
material, to the business of Buyer or to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(c) The parties hereto commit to instruct their respective counsel to
cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate and
expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR
Act at the earliest practicable dates. Such reasonable best efforts and
cooperation include counsels undertaking (i) to keep each other
appropriately informed of material communications from and to personnel of
the reviewing Governmental Bodies and (ii) to confer with each other regarding
appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of such Governmental
Bodies and the content of any such contacts or presentations. Neither the
Company nor the Buyer Parties will participate in any meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Body with respect of any such filings, applications,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of
the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by the relevant
Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting
or discussion (which, at the request of either Buyer or the Company, will be
limited to outside antitrust counsel only). The Company will have the right to
review (subject to appropriate redactions for confidentiality and attorney-
client privilege concerns) and consent to (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) the content of any presentations, white papers or
other written materials to be submitted to any Governmental Body in advance of
any such submission.

 



52 (d) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, the Buyer Parties will
not take any action, or refrain from taking any action, the effect of which
could reasonably be expected to delay or impede the ability of the parties to
consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Buyer Parties will not, and will not permit any member of the Buyer Group
or their respective Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire (by merging or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or
equity in, or by any other manner), any Person or portion thereof, or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into a
definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition,
merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay
in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any permits,
orders or other approvals of any Governmental Body necessary to consummate the
Transactions or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Body entering an
order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions or (iii) delay the
consummation of the Transactions.

 

9.04 _Written Consents; Section_ __ _ 262 Notices_.

 

(a) Promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) following the

Necessary Stockholder Approval, evidencing the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the Transactions.

 

(b) The Company will, in accordance with applicable Law and its organizational

Agreement, deliver to any Stockholder that has not theretofore executed a
written consent adopting this Agreement (each a " _Remaining Stockholder_ ")
(i) an information statement, (ii) the form of written consent adopting this
Agreement, approving the Transactions and waiving any appraisal rights under

Merger, including, to the extent applicable, adequate notice of the Merger and
information concerning dissenters rights under the DGCL to all
Stockholders entitled to receive such under the DGCL, (iv) notice to the
Remaining Stockholders advising them of the action taken pursuant to the
Necessary Stockholder Approval, which notice will be given pursuant to and in

Consent approving the Merger as provided in Section 228 of the DGCL, and (z)
waive any appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Stockholder Materials_ "). The Stockholder Materials will include the
recommendation of the board of directors of the Company to its Stockholders
that they approve the Merger and adopt this Agreement, and the determination
of the board of directors of the Company that the terms and conditions of the
Merger are fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, the
Stockholders. Approval of this Agreement by the Stockholders of the Company
will not restrict the ability of the Companys board of directors thereafter
to terminate or amend this Agreement to the extent permitted by this Agreement
and not prohibited under Section 251(d) of the DGCL. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company will deliver to
Buyer, for review and comment, the Stockholder Materials to be delivered to
the Remaining Stockholders, and will incorporate therein any reasonable
comments of Buyer and its legal counsel delivered to the Company within two
(2) Business Days after receiving the Stockholder Materials. The Stockholder
Materials will be mailed by the Company to the Remaining Stockholders not
later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement.

indemnified, solely from the Indemnity Escrow Funds, from, against and in
respect of any and all Losses arising out of: 

(i) any breach, or the failure to be true and correct, of any representation
or warranty made by the Company in  _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_;

group of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was a member on or
prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations section
1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar State, local or non-U.S. law or
regulation, (y) of any Person (other than the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing, or (z) arising by reason of Section 965 of the Code to the extent
such Taxes are attributable to earnings and profits of the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to a period ending on or before the Closing
Date;

 

(iv) any unpaid Transaction Expenses or Closing Indebtedness as of the
Effective Time, in each case to the extent not paid or taken into account in
the determination of the Closing Statement pursuant to _ARTICLE_ __ _ I_.

(b) The Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties described in this _Section_
__ _ 10.01_ as to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification are collectively referred to as " _Buyer Losses_ ".
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, for
purposes of determining a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty
set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_ or the amount of any Buyer Losses resulting
therefrom, except as set forth in clause (ii) of the first sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 3.07_, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers
or words of similar import contained in such representation or warranty giving
rise to the claim of indemnification hereunder will in each case be
disregarded and without effect (as if such standard or qualification were
deleted from such representation or warranty).

 

10.02 _Indemnification Obligations of Buyer_. Buyer will indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Equityholder Indemnified Parties from, against and in
respect of any and all Losses arising out of:

(a) any breach, or the failure to be true and correct, of any representation
or warranty made by Buyer and Merger Sub in _ARTICLE_ __ _ IV_; and

 



54 (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made by Buyer in this
Agreement.

 

The Losses of the Equityholder Indemnified Parties described in this _Section_
__ _ 10.02_ as to which the Equityholder Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification are collectively referred to as " _Equityholder Losses_ ".
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, for
purposes of determining a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ IV_ or the amount of any Equityholder
Losses resulting therefrom, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect
qualifiers or words of similar import contained in such representation or
warranty giving rise to the claim of indemnification hereunder will in each
case be disregarded and without effect (as if such standard or qualification
were deleted from such representation or warranty).

 

10.03 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice from a third
party of a threatened or filed complaint or the threatened or
actual commencement of any audit, investigation, action or proceeding (a "
_Third Party Claim_ ") with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be
entitled to indemnification hereunder, such Indemnified Party will provide
written notification (which shall state in reasonable detail the nature and
basis of such Third Party Claim, the basis of the claim for indemnification
with respect thereto and (to the extent known or reasonably ascertainable) the
amount of Losses related thereto) to Buyer or the Representative (on behalf
of the Equityholders), whichever is the appropriate indemnifying Party
hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party from liability under this Agreement with respect to such Third Party
Claim except to the extent, and only to the extent that, such failure to
notify the Indemnifying Party results in (i) the forfeiture by the
Indemnifying Party of material rights and defenses otherwise available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim or (ii) material
prejudice to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.
Subject to the consent rights of any insurer or other limitations in the RandW
Policy, the Indemnifying Party will have the right, upon written notice
delivered to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days thereafter (or
sooner if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires), to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, including the employment of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of the fees
and disbursements of such counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Representative will not have the right to
defend a Third Party Claim if (x) a Buyer Indemnified Party or any insurer is
required to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim pursuant to the RandW
Insurance Policy, or (y) such Third Party Claim (A) includes a claim relating
to (I) ownership of any Intellectual Property owned by or purported to be
owned by the Company or any Subsidiary, or (II) that any Intellectual
Property owned by, or exclusively licensed to, Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary, infringes or violates, or constitutes or results from a
misappropriation of, any such Intellectual Property, (B) involves potential
criminal liability of Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary, (C) includes a
claim relating to Tax matters, or (D) seeks injunctive relief that would
reasonably be expected to result in a material restriction on the continuing
business interests of such Person against Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary, in each of which cases, Buyer may elect to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim and be entitled to settle or compromise such Third
Party Claim with the consent of the Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (with the reasonable expenses
and any settled or compromise amounts constituting Buyer Losses hereunder) and
the Representative will have the right to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense, but Buyer will control the
investigation and defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party declines, fails
or is not permitted by the terms of this Agreement to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim within such twenty (20) day period, however, the
Indemnified Party may employ counsel to represent or defend it in any such
Third Party Claim and, if the Indemnifying Party agrees that such Third Party
Claim is a matter with respect to which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive payment from the Indemnifying Party for the Loss in question, the
Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such
counsel as incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
will not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in any single Third
Party Claim. In any Third Party Claim with respect to which indemnification
is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party,
whichever is not assuming the defense of such action, will have the right to
participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at such Partys own
expense; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Indemnifying Party agrees that such
Third Party Claim is a matter with respect to which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive payment from the Indemnifying Party for the Loss in
question, the Indemnifying Party will pay the out of pocket expenses of such
Indemnified Partys counsel if the named parties to any such action (including
any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party will have been advised by its
counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Party which are not available to such Indemnifying Party, or if
available to such Indemnifying Party, the assertion of which would be adverse
to or in conflict with the interests of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, will at all
times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of
any matter the defense of which they are maintaining and to cooperate in good
faith with each other with respect to the defense of any such matter. 

 



55 (b) Neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor the Representative, on the other, may
consent to the entry of any judgment, settle or compromise any claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is
being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party
(which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_
, _however_ , the Indemnifying Party may enter into a judgment or settlement
without the consent of the Indemnified Party if (i) such judgment or
settlement provides solely for the payment of money and does not result in
any financial or other obligation of the Indemnified Party, (ii) Indemnifying
Party makes such payment in full pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the
applicable Indemnified Parties receive an unconditional full and final
release related to such Third Party Claim.

(c) If an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this
_ARTICLE_ __ _ X_ __ not involving a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_
"), such Indemnified Party will send written notice of such claim to the
appropriate Indemnifying Party, and, if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer
Indemnified Party, to the Escrow Agent. Such notice will specify in reasonable
detail the nature and basis for such claim, the basis of the claim for
indemnification with respect thereto and (to the extent known or
reasonably ascertainable) the amount of Losses related thereto (a " _Claim
Notice_ _"_ ). As promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has given
such notice, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party
will work together in good faith to establish the merits and amount of such
claim (by mutual agreement, arbitration, litigation or otherwise) and no later
than 30 days after its receipt of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party may
(i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive payment for all
of the Losses at issue in the Claim Notice, or (ii) object to any Direct Claim
set forth in such Claim Notice by delivering written notice to the Indemnified
Party, and, if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party, copying
the Escrow Agent, of the Indemnifying Partys objection (an " _Objection
Notice_ "), which shall set forth in reasonable detail each disputed item and
the basis for each such disputed item. If (i) a Claim Notice was delivered to
the Indemnifying Party and, as applicable, the Escrow Agent, on or prior to
the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the " _Claim
Expiration Date_ _"_ ) and no Objection Notice was delivered to the
Indemnified Party and, as applicable, the Escrow Agent, within 30 days after
the receipt of the Claim Notice by the Indemnifying Party (or if such day is
not a Business Day, then the next Business Day), or (ii) an Objection Notice
was timely delivered to the Indemnified Party and, as applicable, the Escrow
Agent, but such Objection Notice was only with respect to a portion of the
Losses claimed in the Claim Notice, then (A) if the Indemnified Party is a
Buyer Indemnified Party, each of Buyer and the Representative will execute and
deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction signed by Buyer and
the Representative instructing the Escrow Agent to release within five (5)
Business Days after such time, such amount of the undisputed Buyer Losses
specified in the Claim Notice to the Buyer (either on its own behalf or on
behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Party) from the Indemnity Escrow Funds, or (B)
if the Indemnified Party is an Equityholder Indemnified Party, Buyer will
promptly pay all undisputed amounts due and owing to the Representative (on
behalf of the Equityholders) by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated by the Representative. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the amount of the Buyer Losses set forth in the Claim Notice
for which no timely objection is made (or portion thereof) is an estimate or
the amount of Buyer Losses was not provided at the time that the Claim Notice
was delivered, Buyer (on behalf of itself or any other Buyer Indemnified
Party) will not be so entitled to receive, and the Escrow Agent will not
deliver, funds in respect of Buyer Losses (or portions thereof) unless and
until it receives joint written notice from Buyer and the Representative
setting forth an agreement with respect to the amount of such Buyer Losses.
The Escrow Agent will distribute cash from the Indemnity Escrow Funds in
accordance with such instructions within five (5) Business Days after its
receipt thereof.

 



56 (d) If an Objection Notice is timely received, then the amount disputed in
such Objection Notice shall be treated as a disputed claim (a " _Disputed
Direct Claim_ ") and, if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party,
the amount of such Disputed Direct Claim as set forth in the Objection Notice
shall be held by the Escrow Agent as a reserved portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Funds. The Escrow Agent will distribute cash from the Indemnity Escrow
Funds in respect of any such Disputed Direct Claim in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any resolution of a Disputed
Direct Claim under this _Section_ __ _ 10.03(d)_ adjudicated by litigation
among the parties will be in accordance with _Sections 11.16_ and _11.17_.

 

10.04 _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Claims Period_. All
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement and any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing, and
the corresponding right to make claims thereunder will survive the Closing, in
each case, for a period of time equal to the applicable Claims Period. The
Claims Period hereunder will begin on the date hereof and terminate as
follows:

(a) with respect to Buyer Losses arising under  _Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)(i)_,
_Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)(ii)_, _10.01(a)(iii)_ and _10.01(a)(iv)_ , the Claims
Period will terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date; 

(b) with respect to Equityholder Losses arising under _Section_ __ _
10.02(a)_, the Claims Period will terminate on the date that is twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date; and

(c) with respect to Equityholder Losses arising under  _Section_ __ _
10.02(b)_, the Claims Period will survive the Closing for the time period set
forth in the applicable covenant (or, if no time period is set forth therein,
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations).

No claim for indemnification can be made after the expiration of the Claims
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , if prior to the close of business on the
last day of the Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party will have been properly
notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim will not have been
finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim will continue to
survive and will remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is
finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

10.05 _Liability Limits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, the obligation to indemnify, defend and hold the Buyer
Indemnified Parties harmless will be limited as follows:

 



57 (a) no amounts of indemnity will be payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.01_ unless and until the Buyer Indemnified Parties will have suffered
Buyer Losses in excess of $3,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") in the aggregate,
in which case, indemnification shall, subject to the other limitations set
forth in this Agreement (including _Section_ __ _ 10.05(b)_ below), be
available for Buyer Losses in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts of indemnity for Buyer Losses (i)
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.01(a)(i)_ with respect to the Fundamental
Representations, or (ii) pursuant to _Section_ _ 10.01(a)(ii)_,
_10.01(a)(iii)_ and _10.01(a)(iv)_ , in each case, will not be subject to
the Deductible;

(b) no amounts of indemnity will be payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01_
unless and until the Buyer Indemnified Parties will have suffered Buyer
Losses in excess of $1,500,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ ") in the aggregate
in excess of the Deductible, in which case the Buyer Indemnified Parties will
be entitled to recover the full amount of Buyer Losses in excess of the
Deductible from the first dollar; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, amounts of indemnity for Buyer Losses (i) pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 10.01(a)(i)_ with respect to the Fundamental Representations, or (ii)
pursuant to Section _ 10.01(a)(ii)_, _10.01(a)(iii)_ and _10.01(a)(iv)_ , in
each case, will not be subject to the Threshold Amount;

 

(c) in no event will the aggregate amount of indemnity required to be paid to
the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement exceed the Indemnity
Escrow Amount;

(d) notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, (i) any
indemnification obligation of the Equityholders under this Agreement will be
satisfied solely from the Indemnity Escrow Funds and (ii) if the Indemnity
Escrow Funds are insufficient to satisfy the Buyer Losses and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties do not have recourse therefor under the RandW Insurance
Policy, then the Buyer Losses in question will remain unsatisfied;

(e) for purposes of computing the aggregate amount of indemnifiable claims
(i) the amount of each claim for Buyer Losses by a Buyer Indemnified Party
will be deemed to be an amount equal to, and any payments from the Indemnity
Escrow Funds pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ will be limited to, the
amount of such Buyer Losses and (ii) against Buyer, the amount of each claim
for Equityholder Losses by an Equityholder Indemnified Party will be deemed to
be an amount equal to, and any payments by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.02_ will be limited to, the amount of such Equityholder Losses, in each of
clause (i) and (ii), that remain after deducting therefrom (x) any third party
insurance proceeds actually received (net of any deductible or related
expenses in pursuing such insurance proceeds), and any indemnity,
contributions or other similar payment actually received from any third party
with respect thereto, and (y) any net cash Tax benefit actually realized in
the taxable year of the indemnification payment or any prior taxable year by a
Buyer Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof with respect to the Buyer
Losses or items giving rise to such claim for indemnification;

(f) the amount of indemnity payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ with
respect to any Buyer Loss will be reduced to the extent such Buyer Loss is
included in the calculation of Closing Merger Consideration;

(g) in any claim for indemnification under this Agreement, no party will be
required to indemnify any Person for punitive, special, or exemplary damages,
except to the extent for amounts paid to a third party where any of the
foregoing are awarded pursuant to a Third Party Claim that is subject to
indemnification hereunder;

 



58 (h) any Indemnified Party that becomes aware of a Loss for which it seeks
indemnification under this _ARTICLE_ __ _ X_ will be required to use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such Loss including taking any
actions reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party and an Indemnifying
Party will not be liable for any Loss to the extent that it is attributable
to the Indemnified Partys failure to mitigate; _provided_ , that an
Indemnified Partys obligation to mitigate any Loss will not include any
obligation or requirement that (i) such Indemnified Party or any of his or
its Affiliates assume or incur any material liability or (ii) would reasonably
be expected to materially disrupt, or otherwise materially affect the business
or operations of such Indemnified Party or any of his or its Affiliates;

(i) in any case where a Buyer Indemnified Party recovers from any third party
any net amount (or receives any net cash Tax benefit as described in
_Section_ __ _ 10.05(e)(y)_) in respect of a matter with respect to which the
Equityholders have indemnified Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, such Buyer
Indemnified Party will promptly pay over to the Representative (on behalf of
the Equityholders) the amount so recovered (or the amount of such net cash Tax
benefit received, as applicable);

 

(j) in no event shall any Buyer Indemnified Party have any right to
indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 10.05_ to the extent that the
applicable Losses are attributable to Taxes (i) arising in any taxable period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (" _Post-Closing Tax
Period_ "), (ii) incurred as a result of any transaction outside the ordinary
course of business occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing (and for
this purpose, the time of Closing shall be determined without regard to the
final sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.01_), (iii) arising due to the
unavailability in any Post-Closing Tax Period of any net operating losses,
credits or other Tax attributes from a taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date, (iv) that were included in the
calculation of Closing Merger Consideration or (v) that are attributable to
the manner in which Buyer finances the Transactions; and

(k) any indemnity payment under this Agreement pursuant to this _ARTICLE_ __
_ X_ will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

 

Nothing in this Agreement will limit the liability of a party to another party
for fraud.

 

10.06 _Exclusive Remedies_. Other than in the event of fraud, from and after
the Closing, the provisions of this  _ARTICLE_ __ _ X_ and _Section_ __ _
11.15_ hereof set forth the exclusive rights and remedies of the parties to
seek or obtain damages or any other remedy or relief whatsoever from any party
with respect to matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section_ __ _ 10.06_ will not operate to interfere with or impede the
operation of the provisions of _ARTICLE_ __ _ I_ providing for the (i)
resolution of certain disputes relating to the Merger Consideration between
the parties and/or by the Firm and (ii) limit the rights of the parties to
seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief
under _Section_ __ _ 11.15_).

10.07 _R andW Insurance Policy_. Buyer will cause the RandW Insurance Policy and
coverage thereunder to be in effect as of the Effective Time. The
Representative, for itself and on behalf of the Equityholders, acknowledges
that Buyer is entering into the RandW Insurance Policy and that, in connection
therewith, a Buyer Indemnified Party may make claims for the same Loss or
series of related Losses under both this _ARTICLE_ __ _ X_, subject to the
limitations set forth in this  _ARTICLE_ __ _ X_, and under the RandW
Insurance Policy. The Representative, for itself and on behalf of the
Equityholders, further acknowledges and agrees that the denial of any claim by
any Buyer Indemnified Party under the RandW Insurance Policy will not be
construed as, or used as evidence that, such Buyer Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification under this _ARTICLE_ __ _ X_, subject to the
limitations set forth in this  _ARTICLE_ __ _ X_.

(a) Except as expressly provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.04_, each of
the representations and warranties and the covenants and agreements (to the
extent such covenant or agreement contemplates or requires performance by such
party prior to the Closing) of the parties set forth in this Agreement or any
other document contemplated hereby, or in any certificate delivered hereunder
or thereunder, will terminate effective immediately as of the Closing. Each
covenant and agreement requiring performance at or after the Closing, will, in
each case, expressly survive Closing in accordance with its terms, and if no
term is specified, then for twenty (20) years following the Effective Time,
and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_ will be deemed to limit any
rights or remedies of any Person for breach of any such surviving covenant or
agreement (with it being understood that Buyer and Merger Sub will also be
liable for breach of any covenant or agreement requiring performance by the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing, and that
nothing herein will limit or affect Buyers or Merger Subs or any of their
respective Affiliates liability for the failure to pay the Merger
Consideration (in whole or in part) or pay any other amounts payable by them
(in whole or in part) as and when required by this Agreement).

(b) Except (i) as set forth in ARTICLE X with regard to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties rights against the Indemnity Escrow Funds, and (ii) for any action or
proceeding for fraud, from and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the Company and the Buyer Parties waive, on
their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action any of them may have against any Seller Party (excluding
any Person who continues to be an officer or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, but only in such Persons
capacity as such) relating to the operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or their respective businesses, or relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement or any other document contemplated hereby, or the Transactions, in
each case, whether or not arising under, or based upon, any Law (including any
right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification,
contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other recourse or remedy) (other
than, and solely with respect to any of the covenants that survive the Closing
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_). Furthermore, except as
expressly provided in the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_,
from and after the Effective Time, without limiting the generality of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.01_, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, (i) no action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding will be brought,
encouraged, supported or maintained by, or on behalf of, any member of the
Buyer Group (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) or the Seller Group against any of the Seller Parties
or Buyer Parties (excluding any Person who continues to be an officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time,
but only in such Persons capacity as such), as the case may be, and (ii) no
recourse will be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, or based
upon, any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company or any
other Person set forth or contained in this Agreement or any other document
contemplated hereby or any certificate, instrument, opinion, agreement or
other document of the Company or any other Person delivered hereunder or in
connection with the Transactions (other than, and solely with respect to, any
of the covenants that survive the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _
10.04_, and _ Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_), the subject matter of this Agreement
or any other document contemplated hereby, the Transactions, the business, the
ownership, operation, management, use or control of the business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their assets, or any actions or
omissions at, or prior to, the Closing or the Effective Time.

 



60 (c) The Buyer Parties and the Seller Parties acknowledge and agree, on their
own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group or the Seller Group, as the case
maybe, that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ (i)
require performance after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law and will survive the Closing for twenty (20) years and will
not be subject to any of the survival or exclusive remedy provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 10.04_ and this _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, and (ii) are an
integral part of the Transactions and that, without the agreements set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, neither party would enter into this Agreement
and the Company would not recommend approval of this Agreement to the
Stockholders. 

11.02 _Acknowledgment by the Buyer Parties_.

 

(a) The Buyer Parties acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on behalf
of the Buyer Group, that they have conducted to their satisfaction an
independent investigation and verification of the business, financial
condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties, contracts,
and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, in making their
determination to proceed with the Transactions, except for the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly and specifically set
forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_, in each case, as qualified by the Disclosure
Schedules, the terms and conditions (including limitations and exclusions) of
this Agreement, and as set forth in the certificate delivered by the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02_, the Buyer Parties have relied solely on the
results of their own independent investigation and verification and have not
relied on, are not relying on, and will not rely on, any of (i) the Company,
(ii) its Subsidiaries, (iii) any Stockholder or Optionholder of the Company,
(iv) that certain datasite administered by Merrill Corporation (the "
_Dataroom_ "), (v) the Projections, or (vi) any other information, statements,
disclosures, or materials, in each case whether written or oral, provided by,
or as part of, any of the foregoing or any other Seller Party, or any failure
of any of the foregoing to disclose or contain any information. The Buyer
Parties acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer
Group, that: (i) the representations and warranties of the Company expressly
and specifically set forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_, in each case, as qualified
by the Disclosure Schedules and in accordance with the express terms and
conditions (including limitations and exclusions) of this Agreement and under
the certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.02_,
are the sole and exclusive representations, warranties, and statements of any
kind made to the Buyer Parties and on which the Buyer Parties may rely in
connection with the Transactions; and (ii) all other representation,
warranties and statements of any kind or nature expressed or implied, are, in
each case, specifically disclaimed by the Company, on its behalf and on
behalf of the Seller Parties. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Buyer Parties acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on
behalf of the Buyer Group, that neither the Company, nor any other Person
(including the Seller Parties), has made, is making or is authorized to make,
and the Buyer Parties, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group,
hereby waive, any warranty or representation (whether in written, electronic
or oral form), express or implied, as to the quality, merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, or condition of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries business, operations, assets, liabilities, prospects or any
portion thereof, except solely to the extent expressly set forth in _ARTICLE_
__ _ III_, in each case, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules, the terms
and conditions (including limitations and exclusions) of this Agreement, or as
set forth in the certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.02_. The Buyer Parties acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and
on behalf of the Buyer Group, that they will not assert, institute or
maintain, and will cause the Buyer Parties not to assert, institute or
maintain, any action, suit, claim, investigation, or proceeding contrary to
the agreements set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.02_.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with the
investigation by the Buyer Parties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the
Buyer Parties and their Affiliates, and the representatives of each of the
foregoing, have received or may receive, from or on behalf of the Company,
certain projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts (whether
in written, electronic or oral form, and including in the Information
Presentation, Dataroom, management meetings, etc.) (collectively, "
_Projections_ "). The Buyer Parties acknowledge and agree, on their own
behalf, and on behalf of the Buyer Group, that (i) such Projections are being
provided solely for the convenience of the Buyer Parties to facilitate their
own independent investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such Projections, (iii) the
Buyer Parties are familiar with such uncertainties, and (iv) the Buyer Parties
are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy
and accuracy of all Projections (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such Projections).

 



61 (c) The Buyer Parties acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on behalf
of the Buyer Group, that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _
11.02_ (i) require performance after the Closing to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law and will survive the Closing for twenty (20) years
and will not be subject to any of the survival or exclusive remedy provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 11.01_; and (ii) are an integral part of the Transactions
and that, without these agreements set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.02_,
the Company would not enter into this Agreement or recommend approval of this
Agreement to the Stockholders.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __
_ 11.02_, will not in any manner be deemed to be a waiver of claims for a
partys fraud.

11.03 _Provision Respecting Representation of Company_. Each of the parties
to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, managers, members, officers, employees and
Affiliates, (a) that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has been retained by, and may serve
as counsel to, each and any of the Representative, Stockholders and
Optionholders and their respective Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) (individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), on the
one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, and the consummation of the Transactions, (b)
that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has not acted as counsel for any other party hereto
in connection with the Transactions and that none of the other parties hereto
has the status of a client of Kirkland and Ellis LLP for conflict of interest or
any other purposes as a result thereof, and (c) that, following consummation
of the Transactions, Kirkland and Ellis LLP (or any of its successors) may serve
as counsel to the Seller Group or any director, member, partner, manager,
officer, employee or Affiliate of any member of the Seller Group, in
connection with any litigation, action, suit, claim, investigation, proceeding
or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions. Notwithstanding such representation or any continued
representation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each of the parties
hereto (on their own behalf and on behalf of their Affiliates) hereby consents
thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of
such parties will cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any
conflict of interest arising from such representation. Buyer, the Company and
the Seller Group hereby agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after
the Closing between Buyer, the Company, and/or its Subsidiaries on the one
hand, and the Seller Group or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand,
Kirkland and Ellis LLP may represent the Seller Group, and/or such Affiliates in
such dispute even though the interests of the Seller Group, and/or such
Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries,
and even though Kirkland and Ellis LLP may have represented the Company or its
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may
be handling ongoing matters for Buyer, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries. In addition, Buyer agrees that (x) all communications prior to
the Effective Time among any member of the Seller Group, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees or Advisors, and Kirkland and Ellis LLP that relate to the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute arising in connection with, this Agreement, or otherwise relating to
any potential sale of the Company or the Transactions (the " _Protected Seller
Communications_ "), will be deemed to be privileged and confidential
communications, (y) all rights to such Protected Seller Communications, the
expectation of client confidentiality, and the control of the confidentiality
and privilege applicable thereto, belong to and will be retained by the Seller
Group, and (z) to the extent Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing) should discover in its
possession after the Closing any Protected Seller Communications, it will take
reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality thereof and will not by
reason thereof assert any loss of confidentiality or privilege protection. As
to any such Protected Seller Communications prior to the Closing Date, Buyer,
the Company, and each of its Subsidiaries together with any of their
respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, further agree
that none of the foregoing may use or rely on any of the Protected Seller
Communications in any action against or involving any of the Seller Group or
Kirkland and Ellis LLP after the Closing. The Protected Seller Communications
may be used by the Seller Group and/or any of their respective Affiliates in
connection with any dispute that relates in any way to this Agreement or the
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and a third party other than the Seller Group (solely in their capacity as
equityholders of the Company or the Representative), on the other hand, the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates may assert the attorney-client
privilege with respect to Protected Seller Communications to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications to such third party. The Buyer
Parties and the Seller Parties acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and
on behalf of the Buyer Group and the Seller Group, respectively, that the
agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 11.03_ (i) require performance
after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law and will
survive the Closing for twenty (20) years and will not be subject to any of
the survival or exclusive remedy provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.01_, and
(ii) are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without the
agreements set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.03_, neither party would enter
into this Agreement and the Company would not recommend approval of this
Agreement to the Stockholders.

 



62 11.04 _Press Releases and Communications_. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement or the Transactions (including any
press release or other public announcement disclosing the transaction
consideration (or any other amounts related thereto)) will be issued or made
by any party to this Agreement or any of its Affiliates or Advisors without
the joint approval of Buyer and the Representative, unless required by Law or
the rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange, in which case
Buyer and the Representative, as applicable, will have the right to review
and comment on such press release or announcement in advance of such
publication; _provided_ that each Seller Party will be entitled to communicate
regarding the Transaction with its and its Affiliates investors and proposed
investors in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
subject to reasonable confidentiality obligations.

 

11.05 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Closing takes place, except as expressly
provided herein, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions will, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 11.18_, be paid by the party incurring or required to incur
such expenses, except that Buyer will pay all fees and expenses of the Paying
Agent and the Escrow Agent.

11.06 _Notices_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices,
demands and other communications to be given or delivered under or by reason
of the provisions of this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to
have been given (a) when personally delivered, (b) when transmitted
via facsimile device or by electronic mail, (c) the day following the day on
which the same has been delivered prepaid to a reputable national overnight
air courier service or (d) the third Business Day following the day on which

11.07 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated without the prior written consent of (a) prior to the Closing, the
Company and Buyer and (b) from and after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation and the Representative; _provided_ , that Buyer and Merger Sub may
assign this Agreement to any of their respective Subsidiaries, provided that
no such assignment shall relieve Buyer or Merger Sub of their respective
obligations under this Agreement.

 



64 11.08 _Amendment and Waiver_. Except as provided herein, any provision of
this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits hereto may be amended
or waived (a) only in a writing signed by Buyer, the Company, the
Representative and, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub, and (b) subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 7.04_, with respect to the waiver of conditions to
Closing as of the Effective Time, any waiver of any provision of this
Agreement will be effective against Buyer, the Company, the Representative or,
prior to the Closing, Merger Sub, only as set forth in a writing executed by
such Person. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any breach or default
thereof will extend to or affect in any way any other provision or prior or
subsequent breach or default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the proviso to the first sentence of _Section_ __
_ 11.09_, _Sections 11.16(b),_ _11.17_ and _11.21_ and this sentence (and any
provision of this Agreement to the extent that any amendment, waiver or other
modification of such provision would modify the substance of any such
Sections) may not be amended, waived or otherwise modified in any manner that
is adverse in any material respect to any Debt Financing Source or any of its
Debt Financing Source Related Parties without the prior written consent of
such Debt Financing Source.

 

11.09 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, including _Sections 6.05_ , _11.01(a),_   _11.02_ , and _11.03_ ,
nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give
any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable
right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement, _provided_ that the Debt Financing Sources and
the Debt Financing Source Related Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries
of, and shall be entitled to rely on, the second sentence of  _Section_ __ _
11.08_, _Sections 11.16(b),_ _11.17_ and _11.21_ and this sentence. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with this Agreement
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances,
the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

11.10 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

11.11 _Construction_. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to
be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent,
and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person. The
headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted
for convenience of reference only and will in no way restrict or otherwise
modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.

 



65 11.12 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged
for purposes of convenience in separately numbered sections corresponding to
the sections of this Agreement; _however_ , each section of the Disclosure
Schedules will be deemed to incorporate by reference all information disclosed
in any other section of the Disclosure Schedules to the extent the relevance
of such information to such other section of the Disclosure Schedules is
reasonably apparent. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and
not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in this
Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedules, or the attached exhibits is not intended to imply that
the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other
items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts
or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are
within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and no party will use
the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any
item in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, or exhibits in any dispute
or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not set forth or included in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules,
or exhibits is or is not required to be disclosed (including whether the
amount or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or
are within or outside of the ordinary course of business. In addition, matters
reflected in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. No information set
forth in the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to broaden in any way the
scope of the parties representations and warranties. Any description of any
agreement, document, instrument, plan, arrangement or other item set forth on
any Disclosure Schedule is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by
the terms of such agreement, document, instrument, plan, arrangement or item.
The information contained in this Agreement, in the Disclosure Schedules and
exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein will be deemed to be an admission by
any party hereto to any Person of any matter whatsoever, including any
violation of Law or breach of contract.

 

11.13 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, Paying Agent Agreement, Escrow Agreement and any other agreements
expressly referred to herein or therein (collectively, " _Transaction
Documents_ "), contain the entire agreement of the parties regarding the
subject matter of this Agreement and the Transactions and supersedes all
prior agreements among the parties respecting the merger or other sale and
purchase of the Company. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises with respect to this Agreement, the terms and provisions
of the execution version of this Agreement will control and prior drafts of
this Agreement and the documents referenced herein will not be considered or
analyzed for any purpose (including in support of parol evidence proffered by
any Person in connection with this Agreement), will be deemed not to provide
any evidence as to the meaning of the provisions hereof or the intent of the
parties with respect hereto and will be deemed joint work product of the
parties.

 

11.14 _Conflict Between Transaction Documents_. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument among the parties
hereto and contemplated by this Agreement, this Agreement will govern and
control.

 



66 11.15 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement
is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise
breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of
them hereunder to consummate the Transactions. It is accordingly agreed that
(a) the parties hereto will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in _Section_ __ _ 11.16_ without proof of damages or
otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the right of specific performance and
other equitable relief is an integral part of the Transactions and without
that right, neither the Company nor Buyer would have entered into this
Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
performance or other equitable relief is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have
an adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
party pursuing an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such Order. The
remedies available to the Company pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 11.15_
will be in addition to any other remedy to which they were entitled at law or
in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance
will not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from seeking to
collect or collecting damages related to Buyers or Merger Subs willful
breach of this Agreement. If, before the End Date, any party hereto brings any
action, in each case in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 11.16_, to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, the End Date will automatically be extended (y) for the period during
which such action is pending,  _plus_ ten (10) Business Days or (z) by such
other time period established by the court presiding over such action, as the
case may be.

 

11.16 _Jurisdiction and Exclusive Venue_.

 

(a) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any action, suit, claim,
investigation or proceeding of any kind whatsoever, including a counterclaim,
cross-claim, or defense, regardless of the legal theory under which such
liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in
contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise under any legal
or equitable theory, that may be based upon, arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
or the Transactions brought by any other party or its successors or assigns
will be brought and determined only in the Delaware Chancery Court and any
state court sitting in the State of Delaware to which an appeal from the
Delaware Chancery Court may be validly taken (or, if the Delaware Chancery
Court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware and any federal appellate court
therefrom), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect
to its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such
action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and the Transactions. Each of the parties agrees not to
commence any action, suit, claim or proceeding relating thereto except in the
courts described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by
any such court in Delaware as described herein, and no party will file a
motion to dismiss any action filed in a state or federal court in the State of
Delaware, on any jurisdictional or venue-related grounds, including the
doctrine of forum non-conveniens. Each party hereby irrevocably consents to
the service of any and all process in any such action, suit, claim or
proceeding by delivery of such process in the manner provided in _Section_ __
_ 11.06_ and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise) in any action, suit, claim or proceeding any claim that service of
process made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.06_ does not constitute
good and valid service of process.

 



67 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto (in the case of the Representative, on behalf of itself
and each of the Stockholders and Optionholders) irrevocably agrees that any
action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding of any kind whatsoever
against the Debt Financing Sources or any of the Debt Financing Source
Related Parties, including a counterclaim, cross-claim, or defense, regardless
of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to
be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in
equity, or otherwise under any legal or equitable theory, that may be based
upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or the Transactions, including
any dispute relating to the Debt Financing, brought by any party hereto, any
Stockholder or any Optionholder or any of their respective successors or
assigns against the Debt Financing Sources or any of the Debt Financing Source
Related Parties will be brought and determined only in the United States
federal court located in, or if that court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, in any New York state court located in, the Borough of Manhattan
in the City of New York, New York, and each of the parties hereto (in the
case of the Representative, on behalf of itself and each of the Stockholders
and Optionholders) hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, with regard to any such action, suit, claim,
investigation or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and

12.03  _Interpretation._ In addition to the definitions referred to or set
forth in this Agreement:

(a) As used herein, "fraud" means a partys fraud in the making of the
express representations and warranties in _ARTICLE_ __ _ III_ or _ARTICLE_ __
_ IV_ (as applicable) or in any certificate delivered hereunder, in each
case, as modified by the Disclosure Schedules.

(b) Accounting terms which are not otherwise defined in this Agreement have
the meanings given to them under GAAP. To the extent that the definition of
an accounting term defined in this Agreement is inconsistent with the meaning
of such term under GAAP, the definition set forth in this Agreement will
control.

 

(c) The terms "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and terms of similar import
are references to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. Section, clause, schedule and exhibit references
contained in this Agreement are references to sections, clauses, schedules and
exhibits in or to this Agreement, unless otherwise specified.

(d) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Where the context permits, the use of the term "or" will be
equivalent to the use of the term "and/or."

 

(e) Words denoting any gender will include all genders, including the neutral
gender. Where a word is defined herein, references to the singular will
include references to the plural and vice versa.

 



86 (f) All references to "$" and dollars will be deemed to refer to United States
currency unless otherwise specifically provided.

(g) All references to a day or days will be deemed to refer to a calendar day
or calendar days, as applicable, unless otherwise specifically provided.

(h) Any document or item will be deemed "delivered", "provided" or "made
available" by the Company or the Representative, as applicable, within the
meaning of this Agreement if such document or item (i) is included in the
electronic Dataroom but only to the extent such information or documents
were accessible to Buyer or its Affiliates and Advisors or (ii) actually
delivered or provided to Buyer or any of Buyers Advisors, including at the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries offices, in each case of clauses (i)
and (ii) prior to the date of this Agreement.

(i) Any reference to any particular Code section or any Law will be
interpreted to include any revision of or successor to that section
regardless of how it is numbered or classified.

(j) Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise
defined therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement.

(k) Whenever this Agreement requires Buyer to take any action or contains a
representation with respect to Buyer, where applicable or necessary to give
effect to the Transactions, such requirement or representation shall be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of its Subsidiaries formed in
connection with the Transactions to take such action and shall be deemed to
include a reference to such Subsidiaries, as applicable, and whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Buyer to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Buyer to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action.
