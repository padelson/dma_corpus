8 ARTICLE 2 __



_THE MERGER_



2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with Indiana Law, Purchaser shall at the
Effective Time be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). As a result
of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease and
the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"). From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.



2.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. The closing (the "Closing") shall be held at
the offices of Morrison and Foerster LLP, 19900 MacArthur Boulevard, Irvine,
California 92612, or such other place as the parties shall agree, at 10:00 am
Pacific Time, on the third business day following the satisfaction or waiver,
as the case may be, of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ or at such
other date, time and place as the parties shall agree in writing. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date." On the Closing
Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing
articles of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the
"Articles of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana, in
such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of Indiana Law. The Merger shall become effective at the time of
such filing or at such subsequent date or time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Articles of Merger (the date and time the Merger
becomes effective being the "Effective Time").



2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the Business Corporation
Law of the State of Indiana ("Indiana Law"). Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and
Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



2.4  _Articles of Incorporation; By-laws_.



(a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company shall
be amended to read as set forth in _Exhibit "A_ " until thereafter amended as
provided by Indiana Law and such Articles of Incorporation and shall be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the By-
laws of Purchaser as set forth in _Exhibit "B"_ shall, effective as of the
Effective Time, be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended as provided by Law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and such By-laws.



 

9 2.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall as of the Effective Time become the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles
of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal. 



2.6 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities (the aggregate of (a), (d) and
(e), is the "Merger Consideration"): 



(a) Each Share (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section
2.6(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive 2.341 shares ("Exchange Ratio") of
common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Stock") and cash
in lieu of fractional shares as set forth in _Section 2.10_ , payable, without
interest, to the holder of such Share, upon surrender, in the manner provided
in _Section 2.9_ , of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share.
Parent shall have the right to increase the Exchange Ratio as provided in
_Section 8.1( _i_ )_. If, prior to the Effective Time, Parent should split or
combine the shares of Parent Stock, or pay a stock dividend or other stock
distribution in, or in exchange for, shares of Parent Stock, or engage in any
similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio will be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such split, combination, dividend, exchange or other distribution or
similar transaction. Each Dissenting Share shall not be converted into the
right to receive any shares of Parent Stock and shall only have the rights
described in _Section 2.8_.



(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Purchaser, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and retired without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and
no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.



(c) Each share of common stock, no par value, of Purchaser issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one (1) duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, no par value, of the Surviving
Corporation.



(d) Each holder of a Company Stock Option shall be given the election (i) to
receive the cash payment described in _Section 2.7(a)_ , or (ii) to have such
Company Stock Option cancelled and converted into the Parent options described
in _Section 2.7(a)_.



(e) Each right to acquire a share of Company Common Stock upon conversion of
those certain 8.5% Convertible Subordinated Promissory Notes (the "Notes"),
due July 1, 2009, in aggregate principal amount of $15,000,000 issued by the
Company shall be converted in accordance with the terms of such Notes into the
right to receive that number of shares of Parent  



 

10  Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock into which they
are convertible immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio.



2.7 _Employee Stock Options_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have adopted such
resolutions, taken such actions and obtained any necessary consents (including
the consent of individual option holders or awardees, if necessary) as may be
required to provide that (i) (A) every option to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time (the "Company Stock Options")
shall be assumed by Parent as of the Effective Time and shall thereafter be
deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the number (rounded to the nearest whole number) of shares of
Parent Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Exchange Ratio, at a price per share (rounded to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by the
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any Company
Stock Option that is an incentive stock option within the meaning of the Code,
such substitution shall be effected in accordance with Section 424(a) of the
Code; or (B) the holder of such Company Stock Option shall have agreed to
surrender and cancel such Company Stock Option in full in exchange for a
payment (to be made at the Effective Time by Parent) equal to the difference,
if any, between $15.61 per share of Company Common Stock and the applicable
per-share exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and then vested and exercisable;
and (ii) each holder of an outstanding interest in the Companys directors
share plan effective as of July 3, 1995 (the "Directors Share Plan") shall
have agreed to surrender and cancel such interest in exchange for a payment
(to be made at the Effective Time by Parent) equal to $15.61 per share of
Company Common Stock represented by such interest.



(b) The Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to approve the
disposition of the Company Stock Options in connection with the Transactions
so as to exempt such dispositions under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. To the
extent any option holder becomes a director or executive officer of Parent at
or before the Effective Time, Parent shall take all action reasonably
necessary to approve the issuance of any replacement option so as to exempt
such award under Section 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.



2.8 _Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are
held by shareholders who shall have not voted such Shares in favor of the
Merger and who shall have properly asserted dissenters rights for such Shares
in accordance with Chapter 44 of the Indiana Business Corporation
Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive any shares of Parent Stock. Such shareholders
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the provisions of
such Chapter 44, except that all Dissenting Shares held by shareholders who
shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost
 



 

11  their rights to demand payment for such Shares under such Chapter 44 shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive Parent Stock
under _Section 2.6(a)_ , without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the
manner provided in _Section 2.9_ , of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Shares.



(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
payment or notices of intent to demand payment received by the Company, under
such Chapter 44 withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to Indiana Law and received by the Company; and (ii) the opportunity
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any shareholders
asserting dissenters rights under such Chapter 44. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for payment or offer to settle or settle any such
demands made under such Chapter 44.



2.9 _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the holders of
Shares to receive Parent Stock to which holders of Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_. Within three (3) business days after
the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit with the Exchange Agent
certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Stock and cash
in lieu of fractional shares into which such Shares are converted in the
Merger. Such funds shall be invested by the Exchange Agent or other person
engaged for that purpose by the Exchange Agent.



(b) As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within 10 business
days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each
person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled
to receive shares of Parent Stock pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ a form of
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the
"Certificates") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor such shares of Parent Stock, and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article 2_ , and such Certificate shall then be canceled.
No interest shall accrue or be paid on amounts payable upon the surrender of
any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If
delivery of Parent Stock is to be made to a person other than the person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock transfer
books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such transfer shall have paid all
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the delivery of Parent Stock to
a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such taxes either
have been paid or are not applicable.



 

12 (c) At any time following the date that is six (6) months after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it
any shares of Parent Stock and any funds which had been made available to the
Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of Shares (including, without
limitation, all interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders
shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Surviving Corporation, Parent, nor the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Law.



(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Law.



(e) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent will issue
or cause to be issued in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the number of whole shares of Parent Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which the Shares are converted in the Merger in
accordance with this _Article 2_. When authorizing such issuance in exchange
therefor, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to give Parent a bond in such reasonable sum as it may direct as
indemnity, or such other form of indemnity, as Parent shall reasonably direct,
against any claim that may be made against Parent with respect to the
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. Subject to the
preceding sentence, no dividends that are declared on shares of Parent Stock
after the Effective Time will be paid to persons entitled to receive
certificates representing shares of Parent Stock until such persons surrender
their Certificates. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid to the person in
whose name the certificates representing such shares of Parent Stock shall be
issued, any dividends which shall have become payable with respect to such
shares of Parent Stock between the Effective Time and the time of such
surrender.



(f) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser and Parent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, the Company Stock Options,
or the Notes such taxes and other amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and pursuant to the
applicable provisions of state, local and foreign Tax laws. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted, withheld and paid to the applicable taxing authority
by the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be, such
deducted, withheld and paid amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, the Company Stock
Options, or the Notes, as the case may be, in respect of which such
deduction, withholding and payment was made by the Surviving Corporation,
Purchaser or Parent.



 

13 2.10 _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall
be issued pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share of Parent Stock pursuant to _Section 2.6_ , cash adjustment
will be paid to each holder in respect of any fractional share of Parent Stock
that would otherwise be issuable to such holder (after taking into account
all the certificates representing Shares delivered by such holder). The amount
of such adjustment shall be the product of such fraction of a share of Parent
Stock multiplied by the closing sales price per share of Parent Stock on the
Nasdaq National Market on the business day preceding the Closing Date.



2.11 _Supplementary Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any
further assignments or assurances in Law or any other things are necessary or
desirable to vest or to perfect or confirm of record in the Surviving
Corporation the title to any property or rights of either Purchaser or the
Company, or otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are hereby authorized
and empowered, in the name of and on behalf of either or both of Purchaser or
the Company, as appropriate, to execute and deliver any and all things
necessary or proper to vest or to perfect or confirm title to such property
or rights in the Surviving Corporation, and otherwise to carry out the
purposes and provisions of this Agreement.



2.12 _Plan of Merger_. The Plan of Merger to be filed with the Articles of
Merger shall consist of the text of this _Article 2_ , omitting _Section 2.2_
and this _Section 2.12_ , provided, that (i) the final Exchange Ratio shall be
specified in the text of _Section 2.6(a)_ , (ii) the words "as set forth in
_Exhibit "B"_ in _Section 2.4(b)_ shall be omitted, and (iii) the second
sentence of _Section 2.6(a)_ shall be omitted. The Plan of Merger shall also
include necessary definitions of terms provided for in this Agreement and
shall be in such customary and legally sufficient form appropriate for filing
with the Articles of Merger as Company and Parent reasonably approve.



ARTICLE 3



_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_



Except as set forth in the disclosure letter (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule") delivered to Parent, with section references in the Company
Disclosure Schedule that correspond to the applicable sections of this
Agreement, or in the Company SEC Reports on file with (or furnished to) the
SEC, in each case at or prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser that:



3.1  _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.



(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and, to the extent applicable, in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power and authority
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign entity to do business and is in good  



 

14  standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.



(b) _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the names and
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of all the Subsidiaries of the
Company, whether consolidated or unconsolidated. The outstanding securities of
the Subsidiaries of the Company consist of (i) shares of capital stock or
other equity interests that are owned, directly or indirectly, by
the Company; and (ii) such securities as are set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. All outstanding shares of capital stock of,
or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary (A) have been duly
authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; (B) are
owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all Liens
except as set forth on _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
and (C) are free of all other restrictions (including restrictions on the
right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other
ownership interests) that would prevent the operation by the Surviving
Corporation of such Subsidiarys business as presently conducted. Except as
set forth above or in _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of or other
equity or voting interests in any person. __



(c) The Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other business association or entity other than the interests
in Subsidiaries set forth in _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.



3.2 _Articles of Incorporation and By-laws_. The Company has heretofore made
available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Articles of
Incorporation and the By-laws or equivalent organizational documents of the
Company, each as amended to date, and each of its Subsidiaries. All such
Articles of Incorporation, By-laws or equivalent organizational documents are
in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in violation of any of the provisions of its Articles of Incorporation,
Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents. The minute books of the
Company contain complete and correct records of all meetings and accurately
reflect all consents, resolutions and other material actions taken by the
shareholders, the Company Board and all committees of the Company Board since
October 1, 1999.



 

3.3 _Capitalization_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 20,000,000 shares
of common stock, no par value, and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no
par value ("Company Preferred Stock"). As of the date hereof: (i) 8,968,691
Shares are issued and outstanding, all of which are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable; (ii) no shares of Company Preferred
Stock were issued and outstanding; (iii) no Shares are held in the treasury of
the Company; (iv) no Shares are held by any of the Companys Subsidiaries; (v)
833,401 shares of Company Common Stock are subject to outstanding options,
814,030 of which  



 

15  are vested and exercisable in accordance with their terms and 19,371 of
which remain unvested; (vi) 833,401 shares of Company Common Stock are
reserved for future issuance pursuant to outstanding employee stock options
or stock incentive rights granted pursuant to stock option plans of the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries; and (vii) rights to receive
28,074 shares of Company Common Stock as deferred compensation are vested
under the Directors Share Plan. Since June 27, 2004 to the date of this
Agreement, no Shares or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares
of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company have been issued
other than the Notes and Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of employee
stock options or stock incentive rights granted pursuant to stock option plans
of the Company and outstanding as of June 27, 2004.



(b) Except as set forth in this _Section 3.3_ and except for (i) the Voting
Agreements; (ii) the rights (the "Rights") issued pursuant to the Rights
Agreement dated as of August 12, 1997, between the Company and Harris Trust and
Savings Bank, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"); and (iii) the Notes,
there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries
having the right to vote on any matters on which the shareholders of the
Company may vote are issued or outstanding.



(c) All Shares subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms
and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are

otherwise) in, any of its Subsidiaries or any other person.

and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject,
in the case of the Merger, to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the

this Agreement by the Company and the  



 

16  consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on its part, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company under the Indiana Business

Transactions other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption
of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Shares
(the "Company Shareholder Approval") and the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by Indiana Law. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser, constitutes
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except (i) that such enforcement may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
generally; and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and
to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
brought.



(b) The restrictions on business combinations contained in Chapter 43 of
Indiana Law have been satisfied with respect to, or are not applicable to,
the Transactions.



(c) The Company Shareholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of the Companys capital stock required by applicable Law and
the Companys organizational instruments to duly effect the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions. Pursuant to meetings duly
noticed and convened in accordance with all applicable Laws and the Companys
Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, and at each of which a quorum was

and the Transactions are fair to, advisable and in the best interest of the
Companys shareholders; (ii) resolved to unanimously recommend to the
Companys shareholders that they approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Transactions; and (iii) directed that the Merger be submitted for
consideration by the holders of Company Common Stock at the Company
Shareholders Meeting for such purpose.



3.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.



(a) The execution and the delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not,
and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict
with or violate the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws or equivalent
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii)
subject, in the case of the Merger, to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Law by which any property or asset of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected; or (iii) result in any breach of
or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound.



 

17 (b) The execution and the delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not,
and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) for applicable requirements, if
any, of the Exchange Act, state securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky
Laws"), state takeover laws, the pre-merger notification requirements of the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), Nasdaq, the requirements in the countries where a merger filing may be
necessary or advisable, and filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by Indiana Law; and (ii) where the failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, authorizations or Permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions and would not have a Material Adverse Effect.



3.6 _Permits; Compliance_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in
possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders
of any Governmental Authority necessary for each of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted (the "Permits" or, individually,
"Permit"), except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation
of, any of the Permits would not prevent or materially delay consummation of
the Merger and would not have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date
hereof, no suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits is pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened, except where the failure to have,
or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Permits would not prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger and would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in conflict with, or in default, breach or violation of any Law applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected, or any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, Permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound,
except for any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that would not
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger and would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.



3.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.  



(a) The Company has timely filed or furnished all forms, reports and
documents it is required to file or furnish with or to the SEC since January
1, 2003 (the "Company SEC Reports"). The Company SEC Reports (i) complied as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (ii) did not, at the time
they were filed or furnished, or, if amended, as of the date of
such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is
required to file or furnish any form, report or other document with the SEC.



 

18 (b) Each of (i) the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports, (ii) the
Companys preliminary annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal
year ending October 3, 2004 provided to Parent (the "Preliminary 2004

financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of June 27,
2004 including the notes thereto (the "Company Balance Sheet"), neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for
liabilities and obligations, incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since June 27, 2004 that would not prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Merger and would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. Crowe Chizek and Company LLC, who has expressed its opinion
with respect to the financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
included in the SEC Reports is an independent public or certified public
accountant firm as required under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.



(d) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent complete and correct
copies of all amendments and modifications that have not been filed by the
Company with the SEC to all agreements, documents and other instruments that
previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC as exhibits to the
Company SEC Reports and that are currently in effect.



(e) The Company is in compliance with the provisions of S/OX applicable to it
as of the date hereof and has implemented such programs and has taken
reasonable steps, upon the advice of the Companys independent auditors and
outside counsel, respectively, to ensure the Companys future compliance (not
later than the relevant statutory and regulatory deadlines therefor) with all
provisions of S/OX which shall become applicable to the Company after the date
hereof.



3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since October 3, 2004, except as
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course and in a manner
consistent with past practice and, since October 3, 2004, there has not been:

Company or any of its Subsidiaries having, or reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;



 

19 (b) any damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) with
respect to any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and having, or reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect;



(c) any change by the Company in its financial or tax accounting methods,
principles or practices; 



(d) any revaluation by the Company of any asset (including, without
limitation, any writing down of the value of inventory or writing off of notes
or accounts receivable), other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice;



(e) any entry by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries into any commitment
or transaction material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;



(f) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or distribution
in respect of any capital stock of the Company or any redemption, purchase or
other acquisition of any of its securities; or



(g) any increase in or establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance,
deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock option
(including, without limitation, the granting of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, performance awards, or restricted stock awards), stock
purchase or other employee benefit plan, or any other increase in the
compensation payable or to become payable to any officers or key employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.



3.9 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no litigation, suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation (an "Action") pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, before any
Governmental Authority that could have a Material Adverse Effect or is
reasonably likely to result in liability of the Company in excess of $300,000
(including all related claims); or seeks to materially delay or prevent the
consummation of any Transaction. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree, settlement
agreement or similar written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority, or any
order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any
Governmental Authority, except as would not prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Merger or not would have a Material Adverse Effect.



3.10  _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all
material employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and

20  employment, termination, severance or other contracts or agreements to which

(b) The Company has delivered to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies
of all documents creating or evidencing any Plan listed in  _Section 3.10(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule including (without limitation) (i) all
amendments thereto and all related trust documents, administrative service
agreements, group annuity contracts, group insurance contracts, and
policies pertaining to fiduciary liability insurance covering the fiduciaries
for each Plan; (ii) all Internal Revenue Service determination, opinion,
notification and advisory letters, and any pending applications and
correspondence to or from the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of
Labor with respect to any such application or letter; (iii) all written
communications to any employee or employees relating to any Plan and any
proposed Plans, in each case, relating to any amendments, terminations,
establishments, increases or decreases in benefits, acceleration of payments

liability to the Company received by employees in the last two (2) years;

documents required to be filed with any Governmental Authority in the last
three (3) years (including, without limitation, summary plan descriptions,
Forms 5500 and summary annual reports for all plans subject to ERISA).
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any express or implied
commitment (x) to create, incur liability with respect to or cause to exist
any other material employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, (y)
to enter into any contract or agreement to provide compensation or benefits
to any individual other than in the ordinary course of business, or (z) to
modify, change or terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a
modification, change or termination required by ERISA, the Code or other
applicable law.



(c) None of the Plans is a (i) defined benefit plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(35) of ERISA); (ii) a plan subject to Section 412 of the Code; (iii)
a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37)(A) or 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan"); or (iv) a pension plan for which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of
ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code (a "Multiple Employer Plan"). None of the
Plans (x) provides for the payment of separation, severance, termination or
similar-type benefits to any person, (y) obligates the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to pay separation, severance, termination or similar-type
benefits solely or partially as a result of any Transaction, or (z) obligates
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payment or provide any
benefit as a result of a "change in control," within the meaning of such term
under Section 280G of the Code. None of the Plans provides for or promises
retiree  



 

21  medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any current or former
employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except
as may otherwise be required by applicable Law. Each of the Plans is subject
only to the laws of the United States or a political subdivision thereof.



(d) Each Plan is and has been operated in all material respects in accordance
with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws including, without
limitation, ERISA and the Code. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
performed all material obligations required to be performed by them under, and
are not in any material respect in default under or in violation of, and
the Company has no knowledge of any material default or violation by any
party to, any Plan. No Action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course) and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event
exists that could give rise to any such Action.



(e) All reports, forms and other documents required to be filed with any
Governmental Authority or furnished to employees with respect to any Plan
(including without limitation, summary plan descriptions, Forms 5500 and
summary annual reports) have been timely filed or furnished and are materially
accurate.



(f) All expenses and liabilities relating to the Plans have been, and will on
the Closing be, fully and properly accrued on the Companys books and records
and disclosed in accordance with GAAP and in Plan financial statements.



(g) Each of the Plans that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code has been timely amended to incorporate the applicable provisions of the
Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994, the Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, the Small Business Job Protection Act of
1996, the Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act
of 1998, the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000, the Economic Growth and
Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, and subsequent legislation enacted
through the date hereof and is the subject of a favorable determination,
notification, or opinion letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service after
January 1, 1997 approving each such Plan as so amended. Each trust maintained
pursuant to any such Plan has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service
to be exempt from taxation under Section 501 of the Code. Nothing has
occurred since the date of the Internal Revenue Services favorable
determination letter that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualification of the Plan and its related trust.

 



(h) There has not been any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Sections 406 or 407 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any
Plan.



(i) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All such
contributions are or were fully deductible for federal income tax purposes and
no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental
Authority and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists which
could give rise to any such challenge or disallowance.



 

22 (j) All of the Plans, to the extent applicable, are in compliance with the
continuation of group health coverage provisions contained in Section 4980B
of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA, the requirements of the
Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended, the requirements of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (including the
regulations set forth in Parts 160, 162, and 164 of Title 45 of the Code of
Federal Regulations), the requirements of the Womens Health and Cancer Rights
Act of 1998, the requirements of the Newborns and Mothers Health Protection
Act of 1996, and any amendment to each such act, or any similar state law
requirements.



(k) Each of the Plans can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued
after the Closing Date in accordance with its terms, without any liability to
the Company, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates other than with respect to
accrued obligations and medical and welfare claims incurred prior to such
amendment or termination.



(l) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates currently maintains
or has maintained in the six (6) years preceding the Closing Date any material
employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement that is not subject to United
States law or that covers individuals who are not employed in the
United States.



3.11 _Labor and Employment Matters_.



(a) There are no controversies pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective employees which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any collective bargaining agreement, work council agreement, work force
agreement or any other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company,
are there any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any
such employees. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has breached
or otherwise failed to comply with any provision of any such agreement
or contract, and there are no grievances outstanding against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries under any such agreement or contract. There are no
unfair labor practice complaints pending against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board or any other court or
tribunal or any current union representation questions involving employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no strike, slowdown, work
stoppage or lockout, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threat thereof, by
or with respect to any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
The consent of any labor union is not required to consummate the Transactions.
There is no obligation to inform, consult or obtain consent whether in
advance or otherwise of any works council, employee representatives or other
representative bodies in order to consummate the Transactions.



(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable
Laws relating to the employment of labor, including those related to wages,
hours, collective bargaining, individual and collective consultation, notice
of termination, redundancy and the payment and withholding of taxes and other
sums as required by the appropriate Governmental Authority and have
withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority or are holding
for payment not yet due to such Governmental Authority all amounts required to
be withheld  



 

23  from employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and are not liable
for any arrears of wages, taxes, penalties or other sums for failure to
comply with any of the foregoing. To the knowledge of the Company, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have paid in full to all employees or adequately
accrued for in accordance with GAAP consistently applied all wages, salaries,
commissions, bonuses, benefits and other compensation due to or on behalf of
such employees and there is no claim with respect to payment of wages, salary
or overtime pay that has been asserted or is now pending or threatened before
any Governmental Authority with respect to any persons currently or formerly
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent
decree with, or citation by, any Governmental Authority relating to employees
or employment practices. There is no charge or proceeding with respect to a
violation of any occupational safety or health standards that has been
asserted and is now pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened with
respect to the Company. There is no charge of discrimination in employment or
employment practices, for any reason, including, without limitation, age,
gender, race, religion or other legally protected category, which has
been asserted and is now pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened
before the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any other
Governmental Authority in any jurisdiction in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have employed or employ any person. No inquiry or investigation
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been made and is now
pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened by the Commission for
Racial Equality, the Equal Opportunities Commission or any similar body.



(c) The employment of each of the employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is terminable at will, without cause or prior notice. Neither the
consummation of the Transactions nor any termination of employment of any
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will result in or give
rise to (i) any liability to make any severance, retention, termination,
change of control, "golden parachute," or any other payment to present or
former employees; or (ii) the acceleration of any other rights or benefits to
any present or former employee, whether pursuant to a Plan, Law, contract or
otherwise. There are no customs, established practices or discretionary
arrangements of the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries in relation to the termination of employment of any of its
employees (whether voluntary or involuntary). Neither the Company nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries has any
outstanding liability to pay compensation for loss of office or employment or
a redundancy payment to any present or former employee. There is no term of
employment of any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
shall entitle that employee to treat the consummation of the Transactions as
amounting to a breach of his contract of employment or entitling him to any
payment or benefit whatsoever or entitling him to treat himself as redundant
or otherwise dismissed or released from any obligation.



3.12 _Information in Registration Statement and Proxy Statement_. The

to the Registration Statement, contain any untrue statement of material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not false or misleading. The Proxy Statement and the

the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as applicable,
and the rules and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information
supplied by Parent or Purchaser or any of their representatives for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement.

not prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger and would not have
a Material Adverse Effect.



(c) The current use of the facilities located on the Owned Property and the
Leased Property does not violate any applicable local zoning or similar land
use or government regulations of any Governmental Authority in any material
respect.



(d) The Owned Property is not subject to any outstanding purchase options nor
has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries entered into any outstanding
contracts, agreements, commitments, letters of intent or similar written
understandings as of the date hereof with others for the sale, mortgage,
pledge, hypothecation, assignment, sublease, lease or other transfer of all or
any part of the Owned Property, and no person has any right or option to
acquire, or right of first refusal with respect to, the Companys interest in
the Owned Property or any part thereof.



(e) Neither the Owned Property nor the Leased Property violates any material
provisions of any applicable building code, fire, health or safety
regulations, or other governmental ordinances, orders or regulations, of any

Laws relating to the Owned Property or the Leased Property or any part
thereof. 



(f) The Company has delivered to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies

other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
generally; and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
brought. The Company and its Subsidiaries have performed all material
obligations required to be performed by them to date under each such Lease,
and there has been no material breach or default under any such leases by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any
other party thereto, nor any such breach or default by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto
which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute an event of
default thereunder.

its Subsidiaries used in the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted, whether either owned by or registered in the name of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or owned by third parties and licensed to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, specifying as to each, as applicable:
(i) the owner of such Intellectual Property; and (ii) the jurisdictions by or
in which such Trademarks have been issued or registered or in which an
application for such issuance or registration has been filed, including the
respective registration or application numbers and dates of
issuance, registration or filing.



(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have all requisite right, title and
interest in, or valid and enforceable rights under IP Contracts, to use all
Intellectual Property necessary to the conduct of their business as presently
conducted. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has knowledge
that, nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries received any oral,
written, or other communication claiming or alleging that, the conduct of the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted
infringes upon or misappropriates the Intellectual Property rights, rights of
publicity or privacy, or any other rights of, or libels or defames, any third
party or person or constitutes unfair competition or trade practices (the
Company and its Subsidiaries are not aware of any basis therefore and have
not received any oral, written, or other communication claiming or alleging
any of the foregoing).



 

26 (c) Each item of Intellectual Property currently used by each of the Company
or its Subsidiaries and material to the conduct of its business as currently
conducted is either (i) exclusively owned by it and was created solely by its
employees acting within the scope of their employment or by third parties, all
of which employees and third parties have written agreements by which they
validly assigned all of their rights, title and interest, including
Intellectual Property rights therein, in and to such item of Intellectual
Property to the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable; or (ii) duly and
validly licensed to the Company or its Subsidiaries for use in the manner
currently used by the Company or its Subsidiaries under an IP Contract.



(d) Each item of Intellectual Property currently owned by or registered in the
name of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Company Owned
Intellectual Property") (i) is subsisting and in full force and effect; (ii)
has not been abandoned or passed into the public domain; (iii) is free and
clear of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens and the rights of Kelly L. Rose
to acquire certain Company Owned Intellectual Property in connection with the
Merger); (iv) to the knowledge of the Company, has not been, and is not
currently, infringed upon or misappropriated by any third parties or persons;
(v) is not subject to any outstanding judgment, order, decree, stipulation or
injunction; (vi) to the knowledge of the Company and its Subsidiaries, is not
the subject of any charge, complaint, action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, claim or demand, pending or threatened, which
challenges the legality, validity, enforceability, use or ownership thereof;
and (vii) any applications, registrations and other filings for which will not
be required to be renewed for at least ninety (90) days after the Closing.
The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps sufficient to
safeguard and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of and their
proprietary rights in all of the Company Owned Intellectual Property not
otherwise protected by patents, patent applications, or copyright or trademark
law.



(e) The Company has delivered or will deliver to Parent within ten (10) days
after the execution of this Agreement copies of all United States, non-United
States and international (i) patents, patent applications, all letters patent
or equivalent rights and applications, including any reissue, extension,
division, continuation, or continuation-in-part applications of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries; and (ii) all registrations of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries of, and applications to register, other Intellectual
Property rights, including, without limitation, with respect to trademarks,
service marks, trade dress, logos, trade names, corporate names, Internet
domain names and addresses, copyrightable works, copyrights and mask works
(collectively, under both _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , "Registered Intellectual
Property"). Except to the extent that there is not a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company and its Subsidiaries, all necessary registration, maintenance
and renewal fees in connection with each item of Registered Intellectual
Property have been paid and all necessary documents and certificates in
connection with such Registered Intellectual Property have been filed with the
relevant patent, copyright, trademark or other Governmental Authority or
domain name registrar(s) in the United States or non-United States
jurisdictions, as the case may be (including, without limitation, the United
States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or
their respective counterparts in any relevant non-United States
jurisdiction), for the purposes of maintaining the Companys and its
Subsidiaries rights in such Registered Intellectual Property.



 

27 (f) The Company has no knowledge of any facts, circumstances or information
that (i) would render any Registered Intellectual Property invalid or
unenforceable; (ii) would adversely affect any pending application for any
Registered Intellectual Property; or (iii) would adversely affect, impede or
otherwise limit the ability of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries to use,
commercialize, license or exploit any Intellectual Property in the manner
currently used by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their
business.



(g) Upon the Closing, all the Company Owned Intellectual Property (other than
Company Owned Intellectual Property required to be assigned to Kelly L. Rose)
will be owned by the Company or will be immediately available for use by the
Company on terms and conditions substantially identical to those under which
Company or its Subsidiaries presently use such Company Owned Intellectual
Property, without any affirmative act by the Company or any other person.



(h) All directors, officers, management employees, and technical and
professional employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are under written
obligation to the Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain in confidence all
confidential or proprietary information acquired by them in the course of
their employment and to assign to the Company and its Subsidiaries all
inventions made by them within the scope of their employment during such
employment and for a reasonable period thereafter.



3.15 _Taxes_.



(a) _Returns Filed and Taxes Paid_. All material Tax Returns required to be
filed by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Company
Group") have been duly filed on a timely basis and such Tax Returns are true,
complete and correct in all material respects. All Taxes shown to be payable
on the Tax Returns or on subsequent assessments with respect thereto have
been paid in full on a timely basis, and no other Taxes are payable by the
Company Group with respect to items or periods covered by such Tax Returns
(whether or not shown on or reportable on such Tax Returns) or with respect to
any period prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company Group has
withheld and paid over all material Taxes required to have been withheld and
paid over, and complied with all information reporting and backup withholding
requirements, including maintenance of required records with respect thereto,
in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor,
independent contractor, or other third party. There are no Liens on any of the
assets of the Company Group with respect to Taxes, other than Liens for Taxes
not yet due and payable or for Taxes that are being contesting in good faith
through appropriate proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been
established.



(b) _Tax Reserves_. The amount of the Company Groups liability for unpaid
Taxes for all periods ending on or before October 3, 2004 does not, in the
aggregate, exceed the amount of the current liability accruals for Taxes
(excluding reserves for deferred Taxes), reflected on the balance sheet
contained in the Preliminary 2004 Financial Statements, and the amount of the
Company Groups liability for unpaid Taxes for all periods ending on or before
the Closing Date shall not, in the aggregate, exceed the amount of the
current liability accruals for Taxes (excluding reserves for deferred Taxes),
as such accruals are reflected on the balance sheet  



 

28  contained in the Preliminary 2004 Financial Statements, as adjusted for
operations and transactions in the ordinary course of business since October
3, 2004 in accordance with past custom and practice.



(c) _Returns Furnished_. The Company has made available to Parent true and
complete copies of (i) relevant portions of federal and any other material
income tax audit reports, statements of deficiencies, closing or other
agreements received by or on behalf of the Company Group relating to Taxes;
and (ii) all federal and state income or franchise tax returns for the Company
Group for all periods ending on and after October 31, 2001. No member of the
Company Group has ever been a member of an affiliated group filing
consolidated returns other than a group of which the Company was the common
parent corporation. No member of the Company Group does business in or derives
income from any state, local, territorial or foreign taxing jurisdiction
other than those for which all Tax Returns have been made available to Parent.



(d) _Tax Deficiencies; Audits; Statutes of Limitations_. The Tax Returns of
the Company Group have never been audited by a government or taxing
authority, nor is any such audit in process, pending or threatened (either in
writing or, to the Companys knowledge, orally, formally or informally). No
deficiencies exist or have been asserted (either in writing or, to
the Companys knowledge, orally, formally or informally) or are expected to
be asserted with respect to Taxes of the Company Group, and no member of the
Company Group has received notice (either in writing or orally, formally or
informally) or, to the Companys knowledge, expects to receive notice that it
has not filed a Tax Return or paid Taxes required to be filed or paid by it.
No member of the Company Group is a party to any action or proceeding for
assessment or collection of Taxes, nor has such event been asserted or
threatened (either in writing or, to the Companys knowledge, orally, formally
or informally) against the Company Group or any of its assets. No waiver or
extension of any statute of limitations is in effect with respect to Taxes or
Tax Returns of the Company Group. Each member of the Company Group has
disclosed on its federal income tax returns all positions taken therein that
could give rise to a substantial understatement penalty within the meaning of
Code Section 6662. No member of the Company Group has participated in a listed
transaction within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4T(b)(2)
("Listed Transaction") (determined without regard to whether such transaction
is a reportable transaction under that regulation ("Reportable Transaction")).



(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Company Group is not (nor has it ever been)
a party to any tax sharing agreement or tax indemnity agreement and has not
assumed the Tax liability of any other person under contract.



(f) _Tax Elections and Special Tax Status_. No member of the Company Group is
a party to any safe harbor lease within the meaning of Section 168(f)(8) of
the Code, as in effect prior to amendment by the Tax Equity and Fiscal
Responsibility Act of 1982. None of the assets of the Company Group is tax
exempt use property within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code
("Tax Exempt Use Property"). No member of the Company Group has entered into
any compensatory agreements with respect to the performance of services which
payment thereunder would result in a nondeductible expense to the Company
Group pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code. The Company Group has not
agreed, nor is it required, to make any  



 

29  adjustment under Code Section 481(a) by reason of a change in accounting
method or otherwise. No member of the Company Group has a permanent
establishment in any foreign country, as defined in any applicable Tax treaty
or convention between the United States of America and such foreign country.



3.16 _Environmental Matters_. Except insofar as the failure of any of the
following statements in this _Section 3.16_ to be accurate would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company:

times been, in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.



(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have obtained and are in compliance in
all material respects with all Permits required under any Environmental Law

Closing solely as a result of the Merger and the other Transactions.



(c) Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any property currently or
formerly owned, leased, controlled or operated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries is subject to any Order or, to the Companys knowledge, proposed
Order under any Environmental Law. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written or, to the Companys knowledge, oral
notice from any person or Governmental Authority regarding or alleging, and no
condition or circumstance exists that is reasonably likely to result in (with
or without notice or lapse of time or both), a violation or failure to comply
with any term or requirement of any Environmental Law or Environmental Permit.



(d) There are no Proceedings (whether adjudicatory, rulemaking, licensing or
otherwise) pending or to the Companys knowledge threatened in law or in
equity, or under any administrative or regulatory authority before any
Governmental Authority, by against or affecting the Company,
its Subsidiaries, the business conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or any property currently or formerly owned, leased, controlled or operated by
the Company or its Subsidiaries involving any actual or alleged Environmental
Claim or any potential suspension, revocation, revision, limitation,
restriction, termination or invalidation of any Environmental Permit. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice or other
communication (whether written or to the Companys knowledge oral) from any
person or Governmental Authority, and no condition or circumstance exists,
that (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) is likely to directly
or indirectly give rise to, or serve as a basis for, the commencement of any
such Proceeding;



(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has Released or
threatened to Release, or arranged for any other person to Release, any
Hazardous Substance at, on, under, from or to any property currently or
formerly owned, leased, controlled or operated by the Company or any of its

Law; (ii) in a manner that would not give rise to any Environmental Claim; and
(iii) at a location that is (A) fully permitted for such Release; (B) has not
been listed or proposed

(f) No Release or threatened Release of any Hazardous Substance has occurred,
or is occurring, at, on, under, from or to (i) any property currently or
formerly owned, leased, controlled or operated by the Company or its
Subsidiaries; or (ii) to the Companys knowledge any other location at which
any Hazardous Substance generated, transported, stored, treated or disposed by
the Company or its Subsidiaries has come to be located, and to the Companys
knowledge no Hazardous Substance is present in, on, under or about, or
migrating to or from any such property that could give rise to any
Environmental Claim.

 



(g) There are no Liens, declarations or deed restrictions that have arisen or
been imposed pursuant to any Environmental Law on any property owned, leased,
controlled or operated the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no action
of any Governmental Authority or other person has been taken or, to
the knowledge of the Company, is in process which could subject any of such
properties to such Liens, declarations or deed restrictions.



(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions will, pursuant to any applicable Environmental Law
(including any so-called "transaction-triggered" or "responsible property
transfer" Environmental Laws) or Environmental Permits, result in any
obligations for site investigation, remediation or other action with respect
to any Hazardous Substance, or any notice to, or consent of, any Governmental
Authorities or other person.



(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any agreement
pursuant to which the Company or its Subsidiaries has agreed to defend,
indemnify or hold harmless any other person for any Environmental Claim or
other liability or loss arising under or related to Environmental Law.



(j) The Company has provided to Parent complete and correct copies of all
studies, reports, surveys, assessments, audits,
correspondence, investigations, analysis, tests, and other documents (whether
in hard copy or electronic form) in the Companys, its Subsidiaries or the
Companys or its Subsidiaries counsels possession or control or to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has access relating to the presence or
alleged presence of Hazardous Substances at, on or affecting any real property
currently or formerly owned, leased, controlled or operated by the Company or
its Subsidiaries, or regarding the Companys or its Subsidiaries compliance
with any applicable Environmental Law.



(k) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any of the statements in this
_Section 3.16_ apply to property other than Owned Property or the Leased
Property, each such representation is made and shall be deemed made only to
the Companys knowledge.



 

31 3.17 _Amendment to Rights Agreement_.



(a) The Company Board has taken all necessary action so that none of the
execution or delivery of this Agreement, nor performance by the respective
parties hereto of their obligations hereunder, nor any of the Transactions
will cause (i) the Rights to become exercisable under the Rights Agreement;
(ii) Parent or Purchaser or any of their affiliates to be deemed an
"Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Rights Agreement); or (iii) the "Share
Acquisition Date" (as defined in the Rights Agreement) to occur upon any such

(b) The "Distribution Date" (as defined in the Rights Agreement) has not
occurred.



3.18  _Material Contracts_.



(a) _Clauses (i)_ through _(viii)_ of _Section 3.18_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contain a list of the following types of contracts and agreements to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (such contracts,
agreements and arrangements as are required to be set forth in _Section
3.18(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule or as required to be filed with
any Company SEC Report and the IP Contracts being "Material Contracts," or a
"Material Contract"):



(i) each contract and agreement that (A) is likely to involve consideration of
more than $500,000, in the aggregate, during the fiscal year ended October 3,
2004, or (B) is likely to involve consideration of more than $500,000, in the

penalty or further payment and without more than ninety (90) days notice; 



(ii) all material broker, distributor, dealer, manufacturers representative,
franchise, agency, sales promotion, market research, marketing, consulting and

Company or any of its Subsidiaries without penalty or further payment and
without more than ninety (90) days notice;



(iii) all management contracts (excluding contracts for employment) and
contracts with other consultants involving payments in excess of $300,000,
including any contracts involving the payment of royalties or other amounts
calculated based upon the revenues or income of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or income or revenues related to any product of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a

or with any person or entity or in any geographic area or during any period of
time;



(vii) all material contracts or arrangements that result in any person or
entity holding a power of attorney from the Company or, to the knowledge of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries that relates to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses; and



(viii) all other contracts and agreements, whether or not made in the ordinary
course of business, the absence or breach of which would have a Material
Adverse Effect.



(b) Each Material Contract is a legal, valid and binding agreement of the
Company, the Company is not in default under any Material Contract and none of
the Material Contracts has been canceled by the other party. To the Companys
knowledge, no other party is in breach of, violation of or default under any
Material Contract. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not in receipt of any
claim of default under any such Material Contract. Neither the execution of
this Agreement nor the consummation of any Transaction shall constitute a
default, give rise to cancellation rights, or otherwise adversely affect any
of the Companys rights under any Material Contract. The Company has furnished
or made available to Parent true and complete copies of all Material
Contracts, including any amendments thereto.



3.19 _Insurance_.



(a) As of the date hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries are, and
continually since the later of October 1, 2001 or the date of acquisition by
or merger with the Company or an affiliate of Company have been, insured by
insurers, reasonably believed by the Company to be of recognized financial
responsibility and solvency, against such losses and risks and in such amounts
as are customary in the businesses in which they are engaged.



(b) With respect to each such insurance policy, (i) the policy is legal,
valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms and, except for
policies that have expired under their terms in the ordinary course, is in
full force and effect, except (A) that such enforcement may be subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
generally; and (B) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefore may be brought;
(ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach or
default (including any such breach or default with respect to the payment of
premiums or the giving of notice), and no event has occurred which, with
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default, or
permit termination or modification, under the policy; and (iii) to the
knowledge of the Company, no insurer on the policy has been declared insolvent
or placed in receivership, conservatorship or liquidation.



 

33 (c) At no time subsequent to October 1, 2001 has the Company or, to the
knowledge of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries (i) been denied any
insurance or indemnity bond coverage which it has requested; (ii) made any
material reduction in the scope or amount of its insurance coverage; or (iii)
received notice from any of its insurance carriers that any insurance
premiums will be subject to increase in an amount materially disproportionate
to the amount of the increases in the amount of coverage with respect thereto
(or with respect to similar insurance) in prior years (except for increases
in insurance premium for such coverages such as are consistent with premium
increases in the insurance industry as a whole for coverages for businesses
such as the Companys business) or that any current insurance coverage will
not be available in the future, other than as a result of the Transactions,
substantially on the same terms as are now in effect.



3.20 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker other than Starshak
Welnhofer and Co. is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has
heretofore furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy of all agreements
between the Company and Starshak Welnhofer and Co. pursuant to which such firm
would be entitled to any payment relating to the Transactions.



3.21 _Takeover Laws_. The Company Board has taken all action, if any,
necessary to ensure that no provision of the Companys Articles of
Incorporation or By-laws or Indiana Law or any other law of the State of
Indiana will impose any additional procedural, voting, approval, fairness or
other restrictions on the timely consummation of the Transactions
or restrict, impair or delay the ability of Parent or Purchaser to engage in
any Transaction or to vote or otherwise exercise all rights as a shareholder
of the Company. Other than the HSR Act and similar anti-trust laws, no other
"fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other anti-
takeover statute or regulation of any Governmental Authority is applicable to
the Company or the Transactions.



3.22 _Customers and Suppliers_. There has not been any material adverse
change in the business relationship of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with any customer who accounted for more than ten percent (10%) of the
Companys sales (on a consolidated basis) during the period from June
27, 2004 to the date hereof, or any supplier from whom the Company and its
Subsidiaries purchased more than ten percent (10%) of the goods or services
(on a consolidated basis) which it purchased during the same period. The
Company has no reason to believe that the benefits of any relationship with
any of such customers or suppliers will not continue after the Effective Time
in substantially the same manner as prior to the date hereof assuming the
Company and its Subsidiaries continue to be operated substantially as before
the Closing.



3.23  _Certain Business Practices_. Neither the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,

3.24 _Affiliate Transactions_. There are no existing contracts, transactions,
indebtedness or other arrangements, or any related series thereof, between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of the
directors, officers or other affiliates of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
on the other hand.



3.25 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the opinion of
Starshak Welnhofer and Co. to the effect that, as of the date hereof, the
Exchange Ratio is fair to the holders of Company Common Stock from a financial
point of view.

Board determines in good faith, after having received advice from outside
legal counsel, that such action is required by its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; (B) Parent Board determines in good faith that the Parent

from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the Merger and the
Transactions taking into account at the time of determination any changes to
the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been proposed by the
Company; and (y) that the person or entity making such Parent Superior
Proposal is capable of consummating such Parent Acquisition Proposal (based

51  in the Merger or approve or recommend, or proposed publicly to approve or
recommend, such Parent Acquisition Proposal.

their obligations under that certain Registration Rights Agreement dated July
12, 2004.

_TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_



8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions may
be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
any approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions by the
shareholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent:



(a) By mutual written consent of each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company.



(b) By either Parent, Purchaser or the Company if (i) the Effective Time
shall not have occurred on or before May 31, 2005 (the "Outside Date");
_provided_ , however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date; or (ii) any
Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
entered any injunction, order, decree or ruling which has become final and
nonappealable and has the effect of making consummation of the Merger illegal
or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger.



(c) By the Company if there shall have been a breach of a representation and
warranty or obligation of Parent or Purchaser hereunder that would give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ and, if such
breach (other than a breach of _Section 6.6_ ) is curable, such default shall
have not been remedied within ten (10) days after receipt by Parent of notice
in writing from the Company specifying in reasonable detail such breach and
requesting that it be remedied; _provided_ , that such ten (10)-day period
shall be extended for so long as Parent or Purchaser shall be making all
reasonable efforts to cure such breach, unless the breach is not susceptible
of a cure.



(d) By Parent if there shall have been a breach of a representation and
warranty or obligation of the Company hereunder that would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ and, if such breach
(other than a breach of _Section 6.5_ ) is curable, such default shall have
not been remedied within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of notice
in writing from Parent or Purchaser specifying in reasonable detail such
breach and requesting that it be remedied; _provided_ , that such ten (10)-day
period shall be extended for so long as the Company shall be making all
reasonable efforts to cure all such breaches, unless the breach is not
susceptible of a cure.



(e) By Parent or Purchaser if (i) the Company Board shall have withdrawn or
modified in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser its approval or
recommendation (or failed to make such recommendation) of this Agreement or
the Transactions, or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing, in each
case whether or not permitted by the terms of this Agreement; (ii) the Company
Board shall have approved or recommended a Company Acquisition Proposal other
than the Merger or proposed publicly to do so, in each case whether or not
permitted by the terms of this Agreement; or (iii) the Registration Statement
is effective, and for any reason (other  



 

59  than the inability to provide adequate notice under Indiana Law subsequent
to such effectiveness) the Company fails to call and hold a duly convened
meeting of the shareholders of the Company for purposes of obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval by the Outside Date.



(f) By the Company if (i) Parent Board shall have withdrawn or modified in a
manner adverse to the Company its approval or recommendation (or failed to
make such recommendation) of the issuance of Parent Stock in the Merger, or
shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing, in each case whether or not
permitted by the terms of this Agreement; (ii) Parent Board shall have
approved or recommended a Parent Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger
or proposed publicly to do so, in each case whether or not permitted by the
terms of this Agreement; or (iii) the Registration Statement is effective, and
for any reason (other than the inability to provide adequate notice under
Delaware law subsequent to such effectiveness) Parent fails to call and hold a
duly convened meeting of the stockholders of Parent for purposes of obtaining
Parent Stockholder Approval by the Outside Date. 



(g) By Parent or the Company if the Company Shareholder Approval is not
obtained at a duly held meeting of shareholders or at any adjournment thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(g)_ shall not be available to the Company where the failure to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval shall have been caused by or related
to the Companys willful breach of this Agreement.



(h) By Parent or the Company if Parent Stockholder Approval is not obtained at
a duly held meeting of stockholders or at any adjournment thereof; _provided_
, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(h)_ shall not be available to Parent where the failure to obtain Parent
Stockholder Approval shall have been caused by or related to Parents willful
breach of this Agreement.



(i) By the Company in the event that:



(i) the Daily Volume Weighted Average Price of Parent Stock over a period of
ten (10) trading days (the "Measurement Value") ending on the business day
following the Company Shareholders Meeting (the "Measurement Date") is less
than $5.00 per share; _and_



(ii) the Company notifies Parent orally and in writing by 5:00 p.m. Pacific
Time on the day following the Measurement Date that the Company desires to
exercise its rights under this _Section 8.1( _i_ )_; _and_



(iii) Parent does not notify the Company orally and in writing on or before
5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the date two (2) business after the Companys
notification under subsection (ii), above (during which two (2) business days
the Closing shall not occur unless Parent has increased the Exchange Ratio as
provided in this _Section 8.1( _i_ )(iii)_), that Parent exercises its right
to increase the Exchange Ratio in a manner calculated to cause the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Stock issuable on the Merger under _Section 2.6(a)_
to equal the quotient of $121,500,000 divided by the Measurement  



 

60  Value determined as of the date of Parents notice pursuant to this _Section
8.1( _i_ )(iii)_. Parent shall have no obligation to increase the Exchange
Ratio;



For purposes of this  _Section 8.1( _i_ )_, the fifth business day following
the Measurement Date is referred to as a "Renewal Date" and the fifth business
day following such Renewal Date and any subsequent Renewal Date shall likewise
be a "Renewal Date." If Parent has exercised its right to increase the
Exchange Ratio, but the Closing does not occur on or before the following
Renewal Date, the Company shall again have the right to recalculate the
Measurement Value as of the business day following that Renewal Date (or any
subsequent Renewal Date until the Closing occurs or this Agreement is
terminated) in the manner provided in Section 8.1(i)(i) above and, if the
Measurement Value as so calculated is less than $5.00 per share, the Company
shall again be entitled to exercise its termination rights under this Section
8.1(i) upon notice to Parent as provided in 8.1(i)(ii), subject to Parents
right to increase the Exchange Ratio as provided in Section 8.1(i)(iii),
which shall in turn be subject to the Closing occurring on or before the
following Renewal Date as provided herein. Parent shall have no obligation to
increase the Exchange Ratio.



(j) By the Company upon acceptance of a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_
, that the Company is not in breach of _Section 6.5_ and complies with
_Section 8.3(a)_.



(k) By Parent upon acceptance of a Parent Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that
Parent is not in breach of _Section 6.6_ and complies with _Section 8.3(a)_.



8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become
void, and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto, except
as set forth in this _Section 8.2_ , _Section 8.3_ and  _Article 9_ and
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any fraud or willful
breach hereof prior to the date of such termination; _provided_ , however,
that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.



8.3 _Fees_.

been absolutely and unconditionally withdrawn or abandoned by such third party
(unless the Company Board publicly announces that it unconditionally rejects
the Company Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) days after the announcement
thereof by the third party); or (B) notwithstanding the withdrawal of such
Company Acquisition Proposal as provided in the foregoing _clause (A)_ , an
agreement for such Company Acquisition Proposal (or substantially similar

unconditionally withdrawn or abandoned by such third party (unless Parent

Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) days after the announcement thereof by
the third party); or (B) notwithstanding the withdrawal of such Parent
Acquisition Proposal as provided in the foregoing _clause (A)_ , an agreement
for such Parent Acquisition Proposal (or substantially similar transaction
with the same party or one or more of its affiliates) is entered into, or

policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal

to any affiliate of Parent; _provided_ , that no such assignment shall relieve

any Indiana state or federal court thereof. The parties hereto hereby



(a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting

65 (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to

named courts.



9.7 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial
by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of,

parties hereto certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver;
and acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into
this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things,
the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 9.7_.



9.8 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are
included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
