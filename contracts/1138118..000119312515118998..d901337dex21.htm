Indemnifying Party&#146;s making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification obligation with respect to such Covered Loss, such proceeds (net of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of securing the same) shall be
promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the indemnification payment made), and the Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance and
indemnity, contribution or similar provisions covering such Loss to the same extent as it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder and shall be permitted to offset against any recovery the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of
