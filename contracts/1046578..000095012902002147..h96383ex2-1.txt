                            (i) Seller shall deliver, or cause to be delivered,

              Payment and satisfaction of the Company Indebtedness:

                  2.4 Purchase Price Adjustment.

                  (a) An adjustment in the Purchase Price paid by Buyer for the
Shares shall be made as described below. Such adjustment shall provide for (i)
an increase in the Purchase Price for the amount of any Company Net Income (or a
decrease in the Purchase Price in the event of a



                                       9
<PAGE>



loss), (ii) a decrease in the Purchase Price for the value of all dividends and
distributions paid by the Company to its stockholders from January 1, 2002
through the Closing Date (including, without limitation, the Corporate Dividend,
but excluding the distribution of those certain deferred tax assets in the
approximate amount of $6.6 million), and (iii) for purposes of calculating the
Final Adjustment Amount, an increase in the Purchase Price for the amount by
which the estimated Taxes for the period January 1, 2002 through the Closing
Date set forth as an intercompany payable on Schedule 2.2 and used in the
calculation of the Estimated Adjustment Amount and the Intercompany Payable, is
less than the amount for Taxes for such period used in the calculation of the
Final Adjustment Amount (or a decrease in the Purchase Price in the event the
amount of Taxes for such period used in the Final Adjustment Amount is less than
the amount used in calculating the Estimated Adjustment Amount and the
Intercompany Payable). The net adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be the
"Adjustment Amount" and shall be calculated and paid by the owing party as set
forth in this Section 2.4. The calculation of the initial estimate of the
Adjustment Amount, including (A) an estimate of the components of the Company
Net Income and (B) the value of each distribution and dividend, is set forth on
Schedule 2.4(a) hereto (the "Estimated Adjustment Amount"). As set forth in this
Section 2.4, after the Closing the final Adjustment Amount shall be calculated,
consistent with the principles used in calculating the Estimated Adjustment
Amount (the "Final Adjustment Amount"). The difference between the Final
Adjustment Amount less the Estimated Adjustment Amount shall be paid by the
owing party hereto to the other party entitled thereto (which shall be Seller if
such amount is positive and Buyer if such amount is negative). The parties agree
that all amounts considered in the determination of the Adjustment Amount shall
be rounded to the nearest $1,000.

                  (b) Within 90 days following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Seller its calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount. Within 30
days following Buyer's notification to Seller of its calculation of the Final
Adjustment Amount, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a notice of objection (an
"Objection Notice") or a notice of acceptance (an "Acceptance Notice") with
respect to the calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount. Buyer shall provide
Seller and its accountants and other representatives, upon reasonable advance
notice, access to such books and records of the Acquired Companies relating to
the calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount as may be reasonably requested by
Seller. Buyer's Calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount shall be final and
binding on the parties if an Acceptance Notice is delivered to Buyer or if no
Objection Notice is delivered to Buyer within such 30 day period. Any Objection
Notice shall specify the items disputed, shall describe the reasons for the
objection thereof, shall state the amount in dispute and shall state Seller's
calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount. If an Objection Notice is given,
Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other with respect to the objection. If
the parties are unable to reach agreement within 15 days after an Objection
Notice has been given, any unresolved disputed items shall be promptly referred
to Deloitte & Touche LLP, provided however, if either of the parties has used
the services of Deloitte & Touche LLP at any time in the six month period prior
to such selection of an accounting firm, then the unresolved items shall be
promptly referred to such other accounting firm mutually agreed to by the
parties (the "Unrelated Accounting Firm"). The Unrelated Accounting Firm shall
be directed to render a written report on the unresolved disputed issues as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 45 days following submission
of the matter to the Unrelated Accounting Firm) and to resolve only those issues
of dispute set forth in the Objection Notice. The resolution of the dispute by
the Unrelated



                                       10
<PAGE>



Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties. The fees and expenses
of the Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be borne equally between Seller and
Buyer; provided, however, that if the Final Adjustment Amount calculated by one
of the parties (the "Differing Party") pursuant to this subsection differs from
the final determination of the Unrelated Accounting Firm by more than twenty
percent to the detriment of such Differing Party, then such Differing Party
shall be responsible for the payment of all of the fees and expenses of the
Unrelated Accounting Firm.

                  (c) If Seller delivers to Buyer the Acceptance Notice referred
to in Section 2.4(c) or fails to deliver an Objection Notice within the 30 day
period required by Section 2.4(c), either Buyer or Seller, as the case may be,
shall pay to the other party any amounts which Buyer's calculation shall
indicate to be owed to the other party within five Business Days after the
delivery of such Acceptance Notice or the expiration of such 30 day period, as
the case may be. Alternatively, if Seller delivers to Buyer the Objection Notice
referred to in Section 2.4(b), within five Business Days after such delivery,
the owing party shall pay the undisputed portion, if any, of the amount owed
and, within five Business Days after the resolution of any dispute by the
parties or the Unrelated Accounting Firm relating to the Objection Notice, the
owing party shall pay the remainder owed, if any. Any payment pursuant to this
Section 2.4 shall be considered an adjustment to the Purchase Price, and shall
be made in immediately available funds. Any payment pursuant to this Section
2.4(c), if not paid within the time set forth herein shall be accompanied by
payment of interest thereon at the rate of ten percent per annum calculated
beginning on the date such amount became payable pursuant to this Section 2.4
and ending on the day prior to the date of payment.

         condition, restriction, easement, encumbrance or other Contract
         pertaining to the property involved in any Current Project. All
         subdivision improvement bonds and other sureties or assurances relating
         in any way to any such property and required by any applicable
         Governmental Entity or pursuant to any Entitlements have been posted
         and are being maintained in accordance with the requirements of such
         applicable Governmental Entitles and/or Entitlements and no claim has

         Acquired Companies is not the fee owner) has made any oral or, except
         for the Entitlements, written commitments or representations to, or
         understandings or Contracts with, any Person or any adjoining property
         owner which would in any way be binding on any of the Acquired
         Companies and would interfere with any Acquired Company's ability to
         develop and improve any of the properties involved in the Current
         Projects with residential developments in accordance with the
         Entitlements, and none of the Acquired Companies, nor the fee owner,
         shall make or enter into any such commitment, representations,
         understandings or Contracts without Buyer's written consent.

                           (vi) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.16(e)(vi) of
         the Company Disclosure Schedule, no property involved in any Current
         Project or, to the knowledge of Seller and the Acquired Companies, any
         Project that is not a Current Project, is located in an area that is
         designated, or in the process of being designated, as a wetland by the
         Army Corps of Engineers, as a critical habitat for any threatened or
         endangered species under the endangered Species Act of 1973, as
         amended, or designated under any other law for



                                       30

         the preservation of fish, wildlife, plants, insects, forests or
         wetlands, or for the preservation of any historical or archeological
         site under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1979, as amended,
         or designated under any other law, that would limit, impair, delay or
         prohibit the construction and development of the Project in accordance
         with the existing or currently proposed plans therefor.

                           (vii) None of the Acquired Companies has received any
         notice from any of their insurance carriers of any defects or
         inadequacies in any of the properties involved in the Current Projects,
         or any portion thereof, which have or would reasonably be expected to
         adversely affect the insurability of any properties or the cost of any
         such insurance. There are no pending insurance claims with respect to
         any portion of any such properties.

                           (viii) To the knowledge of Seller and the Acquired
         Companies, there are no soil conditions that would require construction
         of foundations different than those customarily built in residential
         projects in the areas in which the Current Projects are located, nor,
         any seismic safety problems relating to any of the properties involved
         in the Projects, any recent seismic activity affecting any such
         properties or any active fault bisecting, underlying or adjacent to any
         such properties. Each of the Acquired Companies or their contractors
         have installed foundations appropriate and customary for the applicable
         soil conditions.

                           (ix) All work performed with respect to the Current
         Projects has been approved by holders of security interests in the
         Current Projects to the extent required by the applicable Contracts.

                           (x) Other than in connection with its sales of homes
         to buyers in the ordinary course of business, none of the Acquired
         Companies has assigned to any third party any of its respective
         development or other rights with respect to the properties involved in
         the Current Projects.

                           (xi) Other than in connection with its sales to home
         buyers in the ordinary course of business, none of the Acquired
         Companies has entered into any Contact to sell any of the properties
         involved in the Current Projects to any third party that was not
         consummated or terminated on or before December 31, 2001.

                  (g) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.16(g) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 2001 no real property owned by the
Acquired Companies has become subject to repurchase by any Person, whether as a

to complete construction thereon within the time period required or otherwise.

                  (h) The backlog of home sales of each of the Current Projects
as of March 31, 2002 is set forth in Schedule 4.16(h). All of the home purchase
Contracts representing the backlog of home sales set forth on Schedule 4.16(h)
have been incurred in the ordinary course of business. Seller is not aware of
any reason that the cancellation rates for such backlog could



                                       31

exceed those experienced by the Acquired Companies during the period covered by
the Financial Statements.

                  4.17 Intellectual Property.

                  (a) Schedule 4.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a true and complete list of all patents, trademarks, trade names, service
marks, internet domain names and copyrights and applications for registration of

(collectively, "Intellectual Property"), owned, used, filed by or licensed to
any of the Acquired Companies, in each case which are, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the financial condition, operating results, assets or
operations of the Company or any of the other Acquired Companies. Except as set
forth in Schedule 4.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each of the Acquired
Companies own, free and clear of any and all Liens, or is licensed or otherwise
possess legally enforceable rights to use, without payment to any other Person
(other than payments to third parties pursuant to the Contracts listed in
Schedule 4.5(a)(xv) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), all Intellectual
Property that is used in the business of such Acquired Company as currently
conducted, except where the failure to own, be licensed or to possess such
rights has not and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not conflict with, alter or impair any
such rights.

                  (b) To the knowledge of Seller and the Acquired Companies, the
conduct of the business of the Acquired Companies does not conflict with the
valid Intellectual Property rights of others and there are no conflicts with or
infringements of any of the Intellectual Property of the Acquired Companies by
any other Person. To the knowledge of Seller and the Acquired Companies, no
other Person has any rights in or right to use any of the Intellectual Property

affect or relate to the ownership, use or operation of any of the assets (both
past and present) of any of the Acquired Companies, whether issued to one of the
Acquired Companies or to any other Person for the benefit of one of the Acquired
Companies (the "Insurance Policies"); provided, however, that the term
"Insurance Policies" shall not include insurance policies maintained in
connection with any Company Benefit Plan (other than workers' compensation
insurance policies). For each Insurance Policy, Schedule 4.18(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule lists (i) the names and addresses of the insurers, (ii) the

<PAGE>



(vii) any self insured retention or deductible, (viii) the aggregate limit of
the policy and the claims paid to date, and (ix) a brief description of the
interests insured thereby. Seller has provided Buyer with true, accurate and
complete copies of each Insurance Policy, provided that general liability,
umbrella and excess policies are the best available copies in the possession of
Seller and the Acquired Companies.

                  (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.18(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (i) the Insurance Policies, in light of the respective
business, operations and assets of the Acquired Companies and the other insureds
under the policies, are or were in amounts and have or had coverages that are
reasonable and customary for Persons engaged in such businesses and operations
and having such assets; (ii) none of the Acquired Companies, nor the Person to
whom such policy has been issued has received notice that any insurer under any
Insurance Policy is denying liability with respect to a claim there under or
defending under a reservation of rights clause, or, to the knowledge of Seller
and the Acquired Companies, indicated any intent to do so or not to renew any
such policy; (iii) the Insurance Policies do not provide for any retrospective
premium adjustment or other experienced-based liability that would be an
obligation of any Acquired Company, (iv) no side agreements or other Contracts
exist that alter the terms of the Insurance Policies, and (v) none of the
liability Insurance Policies contain any mold or soils exclusions from coverage.

                  (c) Each current Insurance Policy is valid and binding and in
full force and effect, no premiums due there under have not been paid and none
of the Acquired Companies nor the Person to whom such policy has been issued has
received any notice of cancellation or termination in respect of any such policy
or is in default thereunder. Schedule 4.18(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
contains a listing of all material open claims made or otherwise asserted by any
of the Acquired Companies against any Insurance Policy. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.18(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any
Acquired Company has received any notice of cancellation or any other indication
that any insurance policy is no longer in full force or effect or will not be
renewed or that the issuer of any policy is not willing or able to perform its
obligations thereunder.

                  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any representations or
warranties made in the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.18 with respect to
general liability policies (including umbrella and excess policies) in effect at
any time during the period from March 31, 1998 through and including December
31, 2000 are made solely to the knowledge of Seller and the Acquired Companies.

assets reflected on the 2001 Balance Sheet, or thereafter acquired, except those

         payable or which may thereafter be paid without penalty or which are
         being contested in good faith;

                           (v) other Liens or other imperfections of title, if
         any, which, do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair
         the assets or the intended use thereof.

herein as the "Permitted Liens".

                  (b) All the material tangible personal property of the

be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer. Buyer has all requisite

on its business as now conducted. Buyer is not in violation of any order or

of this Agreement, nor the consummation by Buyer of the transactions
contemplated herein in accordance with the terms hereof, will:

any Person, or taken any other action, which may result in the obligation of any
other party to this Agreement to pay any finder's fees, brokerage or agent's
commissions or other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading
to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  5.5 Funds. Buyer has the funds necessary to consummate the

         and/or adopting employers under the Company Benefit Plans that are not
         sponsored or maintained solely by the Acquired Companies; provided
         however, that after the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall
         contribute such amounts to, or with respect to, the Company 401(k) Plan
         as are necessary to satisfy their obligations with respect to benefits
         accrued under such plan prior to the Closing Date; and

                           (ii) each individual who is employed by any Acquired
         Company as of the Closing (a "Continuing Employee") to have a fully
         vested and nonforfeitable interest in his or her entire account balance
         under any Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Code Section 401(a),
         including any plan subject to Code Section 401(k) (the "Company 401(k)
         Plan").

                  (b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause each
Continuing Employee to be provided with compensation and benefits on a basis
substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer
and its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Section 6.6 or this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Continuing Employee
any right to continued employment or any right to wages or benefits at any time
after the Closing Date.

                  (c) Buyer shall cause each Continuing Employee and his or her
eligible dependents, as determined under the terms of Buyer's benefit plans
(including all such Continuing Employee's dependents covered immediately prior
to the Closing Date by a Company Benefit Plan that is a group health plan,
provided that such dependent is not a qualified beneficiary receiving
continuation coverage under such plan pursuant to Code section 4980B(f) (COBRA)
or similar state law) to be covered under a group health plan maintained by
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer that provides medical and dental benefits to the
Continuing Employee and such eligible dependents effective as of the Closing
Date.

                  (d) Buyer shall cause the employee benefit plans and programs
maintained after the Closing by Buyer, the Acquired Companies and the other
Affiliates of Buyer to recognize each Continuing Employee's years of service
prior to the Closing Date with the Acquired Companies, Seller and the Affiliates
of Seller for purposes of terms of employment, eligibility and vesting
determinations under such plans and programs, and determining the level of
benefits to be provided under applicable severance and vacation plans and
policies.

                  (e) Seller shall (i) take such actions, if any, as may be
necessary to provide for the distribution to the Continuing Employees of their
vested account balances under the Company 401(k) Plan, (ii) permit each
Continuing Employee to elect on the Closing Date (or as soon thereafter as
reasonably practicable) a direct rollover of his or her rolloverable account
balance (including any outstanding loans) under the Company 401(k) Plan to a
defined contribution plan designated by Buyer and maintained by Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer (the


                                       42
<PAGE>


"Buyer 401(k) Plan"), and (iii) cause the Company 401(k) Plan to deliver to the
Buyer 401(k) Plan as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date the
promissory notes and other loan documentation, if any, of the Continuing
Employees who have elected such a direct rollover in accordance with the
procedures established by Seller. Seller shall also take such actions, if any,
as are necessary to permit the continuation of loan repayments to the Company
401(k) Plan by Continuing Employees (which loan repayments shall be made by
payroll deduction by Buyer or one of its Affiliates) during the period beginning
on the Closing Date and ending 90 calendar days after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that if a Continuing Employee makes a direct rollover
election as described in this paragraph within such 90-day period, then the
Company 401(k) Plan shall continue to accept such loan repayments from such
Continuing Employee until the date of such direct rollover. Buyer shall cause
the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept the direct rollover of electing Continuing
Employees' benefits in cash and, if applicable, promissory notes from the
Company 401(k) Plan. Buyer represents, covenants and agrees with respect to the
Buyer 401(k) Plan that, as of the date of each rollover described in this
paragraph, such plan (1) is intended to satisfy the requirements of Code
Sections 401(a), (k), and (m) and (2) has received a favorable determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service regarding such qualified status.

                  (f) Buyer expressly agrees that it assumes all obligations to
provide any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, as amended, with respect to the termination of any employee of
an Acquired Company that occurs after the Closing Date.

                  (g) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the
Acquired Companies to honor their respective obligations under the employment
Contracts set forth on Schedule 4.5(a)(vi) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

                  (h) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume all
liability for workers' compensation claims relating to any Continuing Employee,
provided that the Acquired Companies continue to be named insureds under
Seller's or its Affiliate's, as applicable, workers' compensation insurance
policy covering such Continuing Employee for services performed on or before the
Closing Date.

                  (i) Seller expressly agrees that it retains liability for all
claims arising under any Company Benefit Plan, including without limitation, any
Company Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in
ERISA Section 3(1), provided such claim arises out of an event occurring, or
with respect to a Company Benefit Plan that is a group health plan, a service or
supply provided, prior to the Closing Date. Buyer expressly agrees that Buyer
and the Acquired Companies shall have all liability for all claims arising under
any "employee benefit plan" as defined in ERISA Section 3(3) providing coverage
to Continuing Employees and their dependents to the extent that such claim
arises out of an event occurring, or, with respect to any such plan that is a
group health plan, a service or supply provided, on or after the Closing Date.

<PAGE>



         Company, provided that nothing contained in this subsection (ii) shall
         prohibit or restrict Seller or its Affiliates from hiring any such
         employee who responds to a general advertisement by Seller or its
         Affiliates or approaches Seller or its Affiliates without any
         solicitation by Seller or its Affiliates.

                           (b) (i) For a period of two years from the Closing,
         Buyer shall not, and Buyer shall cause each of its Affiliates not to,
         directly or indirectly perform any action, activity or course of
         conduct consisting of or encouraging the following: (A) soliciting,
         recruiting or hiring any Key Employees of Seller or its Affiliates

         Employees"); or (B) soliciting or encouraging any Seller Key Employee
         to leave the employment of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
         Acquired Companies).

                                    (ii) For a period of one year from the
         Closing, Buyer shall not, and Buyer shall cause each of its Affiliates
         not to, directly or indirectly perform any action, activity or course

that James Carr shall not provide any services to Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies).

the contrary, the parties hereto recognize and agree that in the event of a
breach of the covenants set forth in this Section 6.8 by any party, money
damages would not be an adequate remedy to the injured party for such breach
and, even if money damages were adequate, it would be impossible to ascertain or
measure with any degree of accuracy the damages sustained by such injured party
therefrom. Accordingly, if there should be a breach or threatened breach by any
party of any provisions of this Section 6.8, the injured party shall be
entitled, either with or without pursuing any potential damage remedies, to
immediately obtain an injunction prohibiting the breaching party from violating
this section without showing or proving actual damage sustained by the injured
party. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall limit or otherwise affect any
remedies that a party may otherwise have under applicable law.

                  (e) If any covenant in this Section 6.8 is held to be
unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public policy, such covenant will be
considered to be divisible with respect to scope, time, and geographic area, and
such lesser scope, time, or geographic area, or all of them, as a court of
competent jurisdiction may determine to be reasonable, not arbitrary, and not
against



                                       45
<PAGE>



public policy, will be effective, binding, and enforceable against Seller or
Buyer, as applicable. Any violation of the provisions of this Section 6.8 shall

respect to such property, including those certain notes dated March 15, 2001 in
the original principal amount of $606,103 (the "Corporate Dividend"), and Seller

and in each case the pre-tax net income of the Company will be decreased by such
amounts for purposes of calculating the Company Net Income.

                  (c) Prior to or at the Closing, Seller shall cause the
Acquired Companies to provide adequate accruals in the financial statements of
the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date for any amounts payable to James
Carr pursuant to that certain Employment Agreement between Communities and James
Carr, dated December 15, 1999, and to David Webber pursuant to that certain
Employment Agreement between Communities and David Webber dated November 1,
1999, with respect to operations of the Acquired Companies through the Closing
Date, and the pre-tax net income of the Company will be decreased by the amount
of any such accruals not reflected on the Financial Statements for purposes of
calculating the Company Net Income.

                  6.11 Insurance.

                  (a) On or before the Closing, Buyer shall secure general
liability insurance policies covering the Acquired Companies, which in light of
the respective business, operations and assets of the Acquired Companies are in
amounts that are reasonable and customary for Persons engaged in such businesses
and operations and having such assets.

                  (b) Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has or will take
any action for the purpose of canceling, eliminating or otherwise diminishing
the insurance coverage provided to the Acquired Companies under the Insurance
Policies with respect to the pre-Closing operations



                                       46

of the Acquired Companies, provided however Seller may notify the carriers and
remove the Acquired Companies as named insureds under such policies for periods
after the Closing.

         6.12 Release of Credit Enhancements or Indemnification.

         (a) Seller has executed certain credit enhancements for the purpose of
guarantying the payment by the Acquired Companies of certain amounts owed by the
Acquired Companies (the "Credit Enhancements"). Set forth in Schedule 6.12 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, with respect to each Credit Enhancement, is the
other party thereto, the Acquired Company that is the beneficiary of the Credit
Enhancement, the amount guaranteed, and, in the case of letters of credit, the
beneficiary thereto.

         (b) Buyer shall use all reasonable efforts to cause Seller to be
released, as of the Closing Date, from any and all obligations under the Credit
Enhancements (which will include Buyer presenting letters of credit to the
issuers of the letters of credit of the Acquired Companies guaranteed by Seller
to guarantee the outstanding letters of credit). In the event that Buyer is
unable to obtain a full and complete release of Seller from any Credit

severally, indemnify Seller from any Damages Seller suffers or incurs to the

reasonably requested by Seller to properly evidence such indemnification
obligation.

         6.13 Mortgage Services.

Preferred Mortgage has committed as of the Closing Date to buyers of homes from
the Acquired Companies to be handled in the normal course of business.

         6.14 Park/Walnut Creek Investors. At the Closing, the parties shall

members, in their capacity as members of Walnut Creek Investors.


                                   ARTICLE VII

             (a) Seller shall indemnify Buyer, its Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing) and each of their respective

and hold them harmless from any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense

breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement,
or contained in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto; (ii) any breach of
any covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement; (iii) any actions taken by
or on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired

or its Subsidiaries; (iv) any existing bodily injury litigation listed on
Schedule 7.2(a)(iv) hereto; (v) a lack of coverage under any Insurance Policy
issued by Reliance Insurance Company, to the extent such Damages would have been
covered by such Insurance Policy if Reliance Insurance Company had been
financially sound (subject however to any applicable self insured retentions and
aggregate limits on such Insurance Policy, and only after reduction for all
other third party sources of recovery, including any State insurance fund); (vi)
any Damages relating to the Maple Ridge Matter or the Hearthstone Matter which
in the aggregate exceed the Reserve Balance (provided that Buyer and the

Contracts made or alleged to be made between such Person and Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

             (b) Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and each of

contained in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto; (ii) any breach of any
covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement, or (iii) any claim by any Person

contemplated hereby.

         7.3 Time Limitations. Neither Buyer nor Seller will have any liability
(for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to:

             (i) any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement,
    other than those in Sections 3.1, 3.4, 4.2, 4.3, 4.9, 4.10, 4.12 and 4.13,
    unless on or before eighteen months following the Closing Date the party
    seeking indemnification notifies the party or parties from which it is
    seeking indemnification in writing of a claim for Damages;


                                       48
<PAGE>


             (ii) any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.10
    unless on or before three years following the Closing Date, the party
    seeking indemnification notifies the party or parties from which it is
    seeking indemnification in writing of a claim for Damages; or

             (iii) any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.13
    unless on or before four years following the Closing Date the party seeking
    indemnification notifies the party or parties from which it is seeking
    indemnification in writing of a claim for Damages;

    in each case, specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable
    detail. A claim with respect to Section 3.1, 3.4, 4.2, 4.3, 4.9 or 4.12 may
    be made at any time prior to 30 days after the expiration of the applicable
    statute of limitations period.

         7.4 Other Limitations.

         (a) Seller will have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise)
with respect to the matters described in Section 7.2(a)(i) (other than a breach
of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in Section 4.14(d),
which shall not be subject to such threshold for Damages) or a breach of the
covenants contained in Article VI (other than the covenants contained in
Sections 6.5, 6.6, 6.9, 6.10 and 6.14, which shall not be subject to such
threshold for Damages) until the total of all Damages with respect to such
matters exceeds the sum of $300,000 and the Excess Reserves, and then only for
the amount by which such Damages exceed the sum of $300,000 and the Excess
Reserves.

                  (b) Buyer will have no liability (for indemnification or
otherwise) with respect to the matters described in Section 7.2(b) until the
total of all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds $300,000, and then
only for the amount by which such Damages exceed $300,000.

         (c) Any amounts otherwise payable to an indemnified party with respect
to indemnification for Damages or Taxes incurred by such indemnified party shall
be reduced by any Tax Benefit received by such indemnified party. The
indemnified party shall use its reasonable best efforts (provided that this
shall not be deemed to require the commencement of legal proceedings) to take
such action as is necessary (including, without limitation, the filing of an
amended Federal and state income tax return or a claim for refund) in order to
obtain any Tax Benefit that may be available as a result of any Damages or Taxes
indemnified hereunder, unless in the opinion of counsel to such indemnified
party there is not substantial authority for claiming a loss, deduction or
credit for such Damages or Taxes. A "Tax Benefit" shall arise if, after taking
into account the tax consequences of the payment or incurrence by such
indemnified party of the Damages or Taxes and any income tax arising out of such
indemnified party's receipt of indemnification pursuant to this Article VII or
Article VIII in respect of such Damages or Taxes, such indemnified party
realizes an actual savings in its liability for Taxes as a result thereof. For
this purpose, an indemnified party shall be deemed to realize an actual savings
in its liability for Taxes upon the filing of its Tax Return claiming actual Tax
savings attributable to such indemnification; provided, however, that if and to
the extent that any such Tax Benefit is ultimately denied by a taxing authority,
the indemnifying party shall pay to such indemnified


                                       49
<PAGE>


party the amount of such denied Tax Benefit plus interest at the rate applied by
such taxing authority to underpayments of Tax from the date that interest begins
to accrue on the underpayment of Tax as a result of the denial of such Tax
Benefit until the date that the amount of such denied Tax Benefit (plus
interest) is paid to such indemnified party by the indemnifying party. In the
event such indemnified party has a net operating loss for Federal income tax
purposes for (or a net operating loss carryover or investment tax credit
carryover to) the year in which a Tax Benefit would otherwise be realized, the
Tax Benefit shall be deemed to be realized, if ever, only in the year or years
in which there is an actual reduction in or refund of the amount of Taxes paid
over what would have been paid in the absence of such Tax Benefit (after giving
effect to such net operating loss or net operating loss carryover or investment
tax credit carryover).

         (d) In no event will Seller's liability (for indemnification or
otherwise) with respect to the matters in Section 7.2(a)(i) or a breach of the
covenants contained in Article VI (other than the covenants contained in
Sections 6.5, 6.9, 6.10 and 6.14, which shall not be subject to such cap) exceed
$32,000,000 in the aggregate.

         (e) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER
SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO BUYER OR ANY BUYER INDEMNITEES NOR BUYER TO SELLER OR ANY
SELLER INDEMNITEES FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EXCEPT
TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE INCLUDED IN AN ACTION BY A THIRD PARTY
AGAINST A BUYER INDEMNITEE OR SELLER INDEMNITEE FOR WHICH SUCH BUYER INDEMNITEE
OR SELLER INDEMNITEE IS ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT;
PROVIDED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, ANY CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION BY
BUYER AGAINST SELLER INVOLVING A LAND CONTRACT BREACH MAY INCLUDE A CLAIM FOR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES PROVIDED THAT THE AMOUNT OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
RECOVERABLE WITH RESPECT TO EACH CURRENT PROJECT WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A LAND
CONTRACT BREACH SHALL BE LIMITED TO $1,500,000.

         7.5 Procedures Relating to Indemnification Involving Third Party
Claims.

         (a) In order for a party to be entitled to any indemnification provided
for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or
demand made by any Person against the indemnified party (a "Third Party Claim"),
such indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of the Third Party Claim within 10 Business Days after
receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party
shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the
period in which the indemnified party failed to give such notice). Any notice of
an indemnification claim involving a Third Party Claim shall specify the nature
of the claim in reasonable detail, the Persons making the claim and the
estimated amount, if practicable, and shall be accompanied by any correspondence
from the third party relating to the Third Party Claim. Thereafter, the
indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, within five Business
Days after the indemnified party's receipt thereof,


                                       50
<PAGE>


copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim. In the event the provisions
of Section 8.4 are inconsistent with any provision of this Article VII, the
provisions of Section 8.4 shall control with respect to the contest of tax
matters.

         (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and,
if it promptly so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected
by the indemnifying party; provided that such counsel has been consented to by
the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
parties acknowledge that, except where the claim reasonably requires an earlier
action be taken for the indemnified party to avoid liability or prejudice, a
response by the indemnified party within 30 days following receipt of notice of
a claim from the indemnified party shall be deemed to be a prompt response.
Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party for
legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with
the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the
indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and
to employ counsel (not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it
being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense.

         (c) In connection with any Third Party Claim, the indemnified parties
and the indemnifying party shall cooperate with each other in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
indemnified or indemnifying party's request) the provision to such party of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim,
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

         (d) If the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, provided however no consent of the indemnified party shall be required
if such settlement, compromise or discharge by its terms releases the
indemnified party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim and would
not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party
shall not have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party
may settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim in good faith
without the indemnifying party's prior consent.

         (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines
in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of a Third
Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Affiliates, other than as a result of
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party,
assume the right to defend, compromise or settle such Third Party Claim, but the
indemnifying party shall not be bound by any compromise, settlement or discharge
effected without its consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.
Seller shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any such claim and to
employ counsel of its choosing (not


                                       51
<PAGE>


reasonably objected to by Buyer), at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by Buyer.

         (f) In the event than an indemnified party is required to incur legal
fees and expenses as a result of an indemnifying party's failure, upon a request
for indemnification, to promptly respond under subsection (b) above as to
whether or not the indemnifying party is assuming the defense of the Third Party
Claim, then such legal fees and expenses may be included in any indemnification
claim made by the indemnified party, provided that such actions were reasonably
required in order for the indemnified party to avoid liability with respect to
such matter.

         7.6 Other Claims. In the event any indemnified party should have a
claim for Damages against any indemnifying party under Section 7.2(a) that does
not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall deliver notice of such
claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. The failure by any
indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the
indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to such indemnified
party under Section 7.2(a), except to the extent that the indemnifying party
demonstrates that it has been prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying
party has disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the indemnifying
party and the indemnified party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to Section 12.11 below.

         7.7 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Should the Closing occur, except as set
forth in Section 6.8 and Article IX hereto, and the Confidentiality Agreement,
(i) Buyer's sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the representations,
warranties or covenants of Seller under this Agreement and any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other than claims of or causes of action
arising from fraud), shall be the remedies provided in this Article VII and
Article VIII, and Buyer hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all
other remedies (other than claims of or causes of actions arising from fraud)
which may be available at law or equity for any breach or alleged breach of any
representations, warranties or covenants of Seller hereunder, and (ii) Seller's
sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the representations, warranties or
covenants of Buyer under this Agreement and any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement (other than claims of or causes of action arising from fraud),
shall be the remedies provided in this Article VII, and Seller hereby waives,
from and after the Closing, any and all other remedies (other than claims of or
causes of actions arising from fraud) which may be available at law or equity
for any breach or alleged breach of any representations, warranties or covenants
of Buyer hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                   TAX MATTERS

         8.1 Section 338(h)(10) Elections.

             (a) The parties intend that the acquisition by Buyer of the stock
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are treated as corporations for federal
or state income tax purposes (as applicable) qualify as a "qualified stock
purchase" under Section 338 of the Code.


                                       52
<PAGE>


Seller (or any appropriate Affiliate of Seller) shall join Buyer in making a
timely election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any comparable election
under state or local law with respect to the acquisition of the Shares acquired
pursuant to this Agreement and with respect to the stock of any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal or
state income tax purposes (as applicable) (the "Section 338(h)(10) Election").
Buyer and Seller (or any appropriate Affiliate of Buyer or Seller) shall be
jointly responsible for the preparation and filing of all forms that are
necessary to effect the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including without
limitation an IRS Form 8023. Buyer and Seller (or any appropriate Affiliate of
Buyer or Seller) shall execute and timely file IRS Forms 8023 and all other
forms, returns, elections, schedules and documents required to effect and
preserve timely the Section 338(h)(10) Elections. After the Closing Date, each
party shall cooperate with the other and shall take all actions reasonably
requested by the other to assure timely and accurate filing of the Section
338(h)(10) Elections.

             (b) In connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, Buyer shall
reasonably determine, and Seller shall accept if reasonable, the fair market
values of the assets and liabilities deemed purchased for purposes of the
computation of the Aggregate Deemed Sale Price (as defined under applicable
Treasury Regulations) of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made and the allocation of
such Aggregate Deemed Sale Price among such assets (the "Allocation Agreement")
in accordance with Section 338 of the Code (the "Valuations"). Buyer and Seller
agree to act, and to cause their respective Affiliates to act, in accordance
with the allocations contained in the Allocation Agreement in any relevant Tax
Returns or similar filings.

             (c) Seller and Buyer agree that, except as required by a final
determination with any tax authority, they will report, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to report, the transfers under this Agreement consistent
with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and will not take, or cause to be taken,
any action in connection with the filing of any Tax Return on behalf of Seller,
Buyer, or their Affiliates or otherwise that would be inconsistent with or
prejudice the Section 338(h)(10) Election or the Allocation Agreement, and they
will take all steps necessary to obtain comparable treatment, where applicable,
for state income Tax purposes.

             (d) It is understood that Seller plans to file an election to have
the Partnership be taxed as an association taxable as a corporation for United
States federal income tax purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller hereby
agrees to file a Florida form F-1065, Florida Partnership Information Return,
for the Partnership for the period commencing with or including the date that
the Partnership elects to be taxed as an association for federal income tax
purposes through the Closing Date so as to cause the Partnership to be treated
as a partnership and not an association taxable as a corporation for Florida
income tax purposes.

         8.2 Indemnification Obligations With Respect to Taxes.

             (a) Seller shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Buyer from and against:

                 (i) all consolidated federal income Taxes of the Company and
         its Subsidiaries and any consolidated, combined or unitary state income
         Taxes of the


                                       53
<PAGE>


         Company and its Subsidiaries that are due with respect to periods
         ending on or prior to the Closing Date, including, without limitation,
         any Taxes resulting from the Company's or its Subsidiaries' ceasing to
         be a member of a consolidated, combined, affiliated, or unitary group,
         any Taxes incurred as a result of making the Section 338(h)(10)
         Election, and any Taxes resulting from the Corporate Dividend, but
         excluding any Taxes resulting from an extraordinary transaction
         undertaken on the Closing Date after the Closing;

                 (ii) all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are due
         with respect to periods ("Straddle Periods") that include but do not
         end on the Closing Date to the extent attributable to the portion of
         the Straddle Period ending at the close of business on the Closing
         Date, but only to the extent such Taxes exceed the amounts taken into
         account therefor in computing the Company Net Income;

                 (iii) all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are
         due with respect to periods ending on or before the Closing Date (other
         than those that are covered by Section 8.2(a)(i) of this Agreement and
         excluding any Taxes resulting from an extraordinary transaction
         undertaken on the Closing Date after the Closing), but only to the
         extent that such Taxes exceed the amounts reserved therefor on the 2001
         Balance Sheet or taken into account therefor in computing the Company
         Net Income; and

                 (iv) all losses resulting from any inaccuracy in or breach of
         the representations, warranties and covenants with respect to Tax
         matters that are contained in Section 4.9 or this Article VIII of this
         Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto.

             (b) Buyer shall be responsible for all Taxes of the Acquired
Companies other than those Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to
Section 8.2(a).

             (c) For purposes of this Article VIII, whenever it is necessary to
determine the liability for Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a
Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes for the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning
after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period
consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the
Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the
Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, and state
and local apportionment factors of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on
a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company and its
Subsidiaries were closed at the close of the Closing Date. However, (i)
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis,
such as the deduction for depreciation; (ii) periodic taxes such real and
personal property taxes shall be apportioned ratably between such periods on a
daily basis and (iii) Taxes resulting from an extraordinary transaction
undertaken on the Closing Date after the Closing shall be allocated to the
post-Closing Date portion of the Straddle Period.

             (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(including provisions set forth in Section 7.4 of this Agreement), the
obligations of Seller and Buyer under this Article VIII shall be unconditional
and absolute, shall not be limited, shall not be subject to a


                                       54
<PAGE>


deductible, threshold, cap, or similar concept, and shall remain in effect until
the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation as to time, except as
provided in Section 7.4(c) of this Agreement.

         8.3 Tax Returns and Payment Responsibility.

             (a) Seller shall be responsible for and shall cause to be prepared
and duly filed (i) all consolidated federal income Tax Returns of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, (ii) all consolidated, combined or unitary state income Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date, and (iii) all Tax Returns of the Company that are due before the
Closing Date. Seller shall pay any Taxes due in respect of the Tax Returns
described in the preceding sentence. Buyer shall be responsible for and shall
cause to be prepared and duly filed all Tax Returns with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, other than those that are the responsibility of Seller
pursuant to this paragraph. Buyer shall pay any Taxes due in respect of the Tax
Returns described in the preceding sentence. Seller shall pay by wire transfer
to Buyer any Straddle Period Taxes for which Seller is responsible pursuant to
Section 8.2(a)(ii), but which are payable with the Straddle Period Tax Returns
to be filed by Buyer pursuant to this section at least three days prior to the
due date for the payment of such Taxes.

             (b) All Straddle Period Tax Returns that are to be prepared and
filed by Buyer pursuant to the preceding paragraph and that relate to Taxes for
which Seller is liable under Section 8.2(a)(ii) shall be submitted to Seller not
later than 15 Business Days prior to the due date for filing of such Tax Returns
(or if such due date is within 45 days following the Closing Date, as promptly
as practicable following the Closing Date). Seller shall have the right to
review such Tax Returns and to review all work papers and procedures used to
prepare any such Tax Return. If Seller, within ten Business Days after delivery
of any such Tax Return, notifies Buyer in writing that it objects to any of the
items in such Tax Return, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the
dispute and, if they are unable to do so, the disputed items shall be resolved
(within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing such Tax
Return) by an internationally recognized independent accounting firm chosen by
both Buyer and Seller. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax
Return shall be filed on that basis. The costs, fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

             (c) Buyer shall not (and shall not cause or permit Company or its
Subsidiaries to) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any
statute of limitation with respect to) any Straddle Period Tax Return without
the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld. Seller shall not (and shall not cause or permit any of its Affiliates
to) amend, refile, or otherwise modify any Tax Return of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is not prepared on a consolidated, combined or unitary
basis (a "Separate Return") if such action could have an adverse affect on the
liability of Company or its Subsidiaries for any Taxes for the post-Closing
portion of a Straddle Period or for any Taxes for a taxable year or period
beginning after the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Buyer,

         reasonable documentation of the hours spent; and (D) such other
         reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller in defending such
         Assumed Claim.

                 (iii) If reimbursement by the Acquired Companies of the costs
         listed in subsection (iii) would cause the aggregate Warranty Costs
         incurred by the Acquired Companies to exceed the Warranty Threshold,
         then the Acquired Companies shall be required to reimburse Seller only
         up to an amount such that the aggregate Warranty Costs incurred by the
         Acquired Companies equals the Warranty Threshold.

             (c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no
party shall be liable to reimburse or indemnify the other under this Agreement
for any Warranty Costs incurred by such other party to the extent that the work
performed by or on behalf of such other party in addressing any Warranty Claim
exceeds the prevailing standards of the homebuilding construction industry in
the area where the work is performed. If the work performed by or on behalf of a
party exceeds such industry standards, then the other party shall only be liable
to reimburse or indemnify the other to the extent that the out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the other party would have been reasonably necessary to meet such
industry standards.

             (d) All reimbursements required hereunder shall be paid promptly

Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of a right of termination will not be
an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated, all further
obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that the
obligations in Section 6.5 and the Confidentiality Agreement between Technical
Olympic and Buyer dated January 25, 2002 (the "Confidentiality Agreement") will
survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by a party
because of the breach of the Agreement by the other party or because one or more
of the conditions to the terminating party's obligations under this Agreement is
not satisfied as a result of the other party's failure to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement, the terminating party's right to pursue all
legal remedies will survive such termination unimpaired.

                                   ARTICLE XII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         12.1 Entire Agreement; Assignment.

              (a) This Agreement (including the documents, schedules, exhibits
and the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, and
all contemporaneous oral agreements and understandings among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement not inconsistent herewith. Except for express
representations, warranties and covenants of Seller contained herein or made by
the executive officers or other authorized officers of Seller in writing after
the date hereof, there are no representations or warranties whatsoever by or on
behalf of Seller or any of its officers, directors, employees, affiliates and
agents relating to the Acquired Companies.

              (b) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder will be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of each other
party hereto.

              (c) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

              (d) If the Closing occurs and if Seller or any of its successors
or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into Engle or its successors or
assigns and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets
to any such Person, then in each case, Seller, as applicable, shall not permit
or authorize such transaction unless proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Seller shall assume the obligations thereof set forth
in this Agreement or provide comparable protections.

         12.2 Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement, each of which shall remain in full force and effect
and in lieu of such invalid or unenforceable provision there shall be
automatically added as part of this Agreement a valid and enforceable provision
as similar in terms to the invalid or unenforceable provision as possible,
provided that this Agreement as amended, (i) reflects the intent of the parties
hereto, and (ii) does not change the bargained for consideration or benefits to
be received by each party hereto.

or to such other address as the Person to whom notice is given may have
previously furnished to the other in writing in the manner set forth above;
provided that notice of any change of address shall be effective only upon
receipt thereof.

         12.4 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws or
rules that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
laws thereof.

         12.5 Construction. In interpreting and construing this Agreement, the
following principles shall be followed:

                  (i) the terms "herein," "hereof," "hereby," and "hereunder,"
         or other similar terms, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not only
         to the particular Article, Section or other subdivision in which any
         such terms may be employed;

                  (ii) references to Articles, Sections, and other subdivisions
         refer to the Articles, Sections, and other subdivisions of this
         Agreement;

                  (iii) all accounting terms not otherwise defined herein have
         the meanings assigned to them in accordance with GAAP;

                  (iv) no consideration shall be given to the captions of the
         articles, sections, subsections, or clauses, which are inserted for
         convenience in locating the provisions of this Agreement and not as an
         aid in its construction;

                  (v) the word "includes" and its syntactical variants mean
         "includes, but is not limited to" and corresponding syntactical variant
         expressions; and

                  (vi) the plural shall be deemed to include the singular, and
         vice versa.

         12.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
including facsimile counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery
of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission shall be effective delivery of a manually executed counterpart to
this Agreement.

         12.7 Parties In Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason


                                       67
<PAGE>


of this Agreement, including any employee or former employee of the Acquired
Companies (or any beneficiary or dependent thereof). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of Article VII shall extend to and benefit such
parties as expressly set forth in such article.

         12.8 Waiver. No waiver of any breach of the provisions of this
Agreement will be deemed to have been made by any party, unless such waiver is
expressed in writing and signed by the party against which it is to be enforced.
The waiver by any party of any right under this Agreement or to a remedy for the
breach of any of the provisions herein shall not operate nor be construed by the
breaching party as a waiver of the non-breaching party's remedies with respect
to any other or continuing or subsequent breach.

         12.9 Amendments. No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of
this Agreement shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by
the parties hereto.

         12.10 Further Assurances. The parties agree (a) to furnish upon request
to each other such further information, (b) to execute and deliver to each other
such other documents, and (c) to do such other acts and things, all as any other
party hereto may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         12.11 Arbitration.

               (a) Any controversy or claim between the parties, whether based
on contract, tort, statute or other legal or equitable theory arising out of or
related to this Agreement (including any amendments or extensions) or the breach
or termination hereof or any right to indemnity hereunder (each, a "Dispute")
shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with arbitration terms and
procedures set forth herein.

               (b) Without in any way limiting subsection (a) above, each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any
action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising between them out of or relating to this Agreement or the
actions or any of them in the negotiation, administration, performance and
enforcement thereof.

               (c) All Disputes submitted to arbitration shall be resolved by
binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the
"AAA") in accordance with, and in the following order of priority, the following
procedural rules: (i) the terms of these arbitration provisions; (ii) the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA; (iii) the Federal Arbitration Act
(Title 9 of the United States Code); and (iv) to the extent the foregoing are
inapplicable, unenforceable or invalid, the laws of the State of New York. The
validity and enforceability of these arbitration provisions shall be determined
in accordance with this same order of priority. In the event of any
inconsistency between these arbitration provisions and such rules and statutes,
these arbitration provisions shall control. Judgment upon any award rendered
hereunder may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

               (d) Either party may invoke arbitration (the "Disputing Party")
by providing notice to the other party (the "Other Party") in which the
Disputing Party shall specify the Dispute in reasonable detail, request
arbitration and designate an arbitrator (the "Dispute Notice"). Within ten
Business Days of receipt of the Dispute Notice, the Other Party shall


                                       68
<PAGE>


designate one arbitrator. The Disputing Party's arbitrator and the Other Party's
arbitrator shall select the third arbitrator. Such three arbitrators shall
constitute the "Arbitration Panel." If the Other Party fails or refuses to
select an arbitrator within the specified ten Business Day period, the Disputing
Party's arbitrator shall be the single arbitrator to resolve the Dispute. The
arbitrator (or the Arbitration Panel, acting by majority vote, as appropriate)
shall resolve all Disputes. If a Dispute involves less that $250,000, then the
parties agree to cooperate to use reasonable efforts to select one neutral
arbitrator to decide the Dispute, and if the parties cannot select a neutral
arbitrator within ten Business Days of receipt of the Dispute Notice, such
neutral arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the rules of the AAA. Subject
to any award of damages pursuant to subsection (e) below, each party shall pay
all fees for the arbitrator selected by such party, and the fees of the neutral
arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties, or, in the event of a single
arbitrator the fees for such arbitrator.

               (e) To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the arbitrator
(or the Arbitration Panel, acting by majority vote, as appropriate) and the
parties shall take all reasonable steps to conclude any arbitration proceeding
hereunder within 90 days of the later of (i) the filing of the Dispute with the
AAA, or (ii) the selection of the arbitrator or Arbitration Panel, as
appropriate. This time may be extended upon written agreement of the parties or
upon order of the arbitrator (or Arbitration Panel acting by majority vote, as
appropriate). Unless the parties shall agree otherwise, arbitration proceedings
hereunder shall be conducted in Miami, Florida. Arbitrators shall be empowered
to impose sanctions, permit or order depositions and discovery and to take such
other actions as they deem necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant
to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and applicable law. With respect to any
Dispute, each party agrees that all discovery activities shall be expressly
limited to matters directly relevant to the Dispute and any arbitrator,
Arbitration Panel and the AAA shall be required to fully enforce this
requirement. Consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration, each party
will, upon the written request of the other party, promptly provide the other
with copies of documents on which the producing party may rely in support of or
in opposition to any claim or defense directly relevant to the issues raised by
any claim or counterclaim. The provisions of these arbitration provisions shall
survive any termination, amendment or expiration of this Agreement, unless the
parties otherwise expressly agree in writing.

               (e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, arbitrators,
including any Arbitration Panel, shall have the power to award recovery of all
costs and fees (including attorneys' fees, administrative fees, travel expenses,
out-of-pocket costs, witness fees, and arbitrators' fees) to the prevailing
party or, if no clear prevailing party, as the arbitrator (or Arbitration Panel,
if applicable) shall deem just and equitable. The arbitration award shall be in
writing, signed by the arbitrator (or a majority of the Arbitration Panel, as
appropriate). Each party agrees to keep all Disputes and arbitration proceedings
strictly confidential, except for disclosures of information acquired by
applicable law or as may be required for enforcement of any award.
