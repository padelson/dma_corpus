Group is entitled to receive payment under any insurance policies or from any other source on account of claims arising under this Article VI, including, without limitation, any litigation and claims described on <U>Schedule 6.1(a) [OMITTED]</U>,
the amount (if any) payable by Shareholders on account of such claims shall be reduced by the amount of such payment, and such amounts shall not be deemed to be Losses hereunder or, if Buyer or the PHP Group shall have already collected on such
claim from Shareholders, then Buyer shall repay to Shareholders the amount of such payment, and such amounts shall not be deemed to be Losses hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) except as provided in
the Separation Agreement, the rights and remedies under this Article VI shall be the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of the parties on account of any claims arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or any transactions
contemplated hereby; (b) no special, incidental, punitive or consequential damages shall be imposed on any party in connection with any indemnification of any or all Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article VI; and (c) all indemnification
payments under this Article VI shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Aggregate Consideration. Except for Taxes which are covered by Section 5.3, the amount of Losses payable by an Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee shall be determined on an
after-tax basis. For example, if a payment of a Loss would constitute income to an Indemnitee, the amount of the payment to the Indemnitee shall be grossed-up or increased so that, after any income Tax on the payment, the payment would equal the
amount of the Loss. In determining any Tax benefit to an Indemnitee, the Tax effect of the Loss shall be determined only by reference to the Tax year in which the Loss is properly taken into account for Tax purposes. For example, if a Loss of an
Indemnitee is deductible and the amount of the deduction increases a net operating loss of an Indemnitee which existed before such deduction, and such net operating loss can only be carried forward to future Tax years of the Indemnitee, the Tax
benefit from the deductibility of the Loss shall considered to be zero even though the Indemnitee may realize Tax benefits from the absorption of the net operating loss carryovers in future Tax years. </FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT
