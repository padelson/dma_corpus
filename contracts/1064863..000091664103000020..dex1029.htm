(iii) each share of the Companys capital stock held in the treasury of
the Company or by a subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Statutory Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, be canceled and cease to exist and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.



(d) _Dissenting Shares; Waiver of Dissenter s Rights_ _._
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares
that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Statutory Effective
Time and which are (i) held by shareholders who shall have not voted in favor
of the Merger or consented thereto in writing, and (ii) who shall have
delivered a written notice of intent to demand payment for such shares in
accordance with Section 607.1320(3) of the Corporation Code and
otherwise perfected their rights under Section 607.1320 of the Corporation
Code (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive any portion of the Aggregate Consideration and
shall be deemed cancelled. Such shareholders (the "Dissenting Shareholders")
shall be entitled to only receive payment of the value of such shares of the
Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of the Corporation Code,
except that all Dissenting Shares held by shareholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Shares pursuant to relevant provisions of the Corporation
Code, shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable, as of the Statutory Effective Time, for the right to
receive, without any interest thereon, such shareholders allocated share of
the Aggregate Consideration. The Company shall comply with Section 607 of the
Corporation Code. The Agent shall hold such portion of the Aggregate
Consideration that would have been allocable to the Dissenting Shareholders if
such shareholders had not dissented as provided above ("Dissenters Allocable
Consideration") until such time as the final, unappealable amount of payment
is determined for the Dissenting Shareholders shares under the Corporation
Code, at which time Agent shall distribute such Dissenters
Allocable Consideration in accordance with the Corporation Code. Each of the
Shareholders hereby waives his, her or its dissenters rights under the
Corporation Code with respect to the Merger to the extent permitted by law,
and agrees to execute to the extent permitted by law, prior to Closing such
documents or instruments as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the
Buyer to evidence or further effect such waiver.



(e) _Estimated Closing Book Value_. Not less than two Business Days
before the Closing Date, Agent shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) the
estimated amount of the Closing Book Value in the form of a consolidated
balance sheet as of the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet")
prepared from the books and records of the PHP Group in accordance with GAAP
(as modified herein) and (ii) a certificate (the "Shareholders Adjustment
Certificate") certifying, to the best of his knowledge, that the Preliminary
Closing Balance Sheet fairly represents the Closing Book Value in accordance
with GAAP (as modified in accordance with the definition of Closing Book Value
and as otherwise specifically provided herein). If the Shareholders
Adjustment Certificate shows a Closing Book Value of less than the
Required Net

 

19 Worth, then the Closing Cash Amount to be delivered at Closing shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the Required Net Worth
and the Closing Book Value (the "Deficit"). If the Shareholders Adjustment
Certificate shows a Closing Book Value of more than the Required Net Worth,
then the Closing Cash Amount to be delivered at Closing shall increase by the
excess of the Closing Book Value over the Required Net Worth (the "Excess").



(f) _Membership Cash Consideration_. If the Business has enrolled at
least 190,000 Members to be provided healthcare services on the Closing Date
(the "Target Membership"), as determined from the State of Florida enrollment
reports, and as verified by Buyer and Agent prior to Closing, Shareholders
shall be entitled to receive an additional Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000) in
the aggregate. If, on the Closing Date, the Business has more than 168,022
Members (the "Base Membership") enrolled to be provided healthcare services,
but less than the Target Membership, Shareholders shall be entitled to receive
an amount in the aggregate equal to Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000)
multiplied by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the number of Members
enrolled to be provided with healthcare services by the Business as of the
Closing Date as determined from the State of Florida enrollment reports
and as verified by Buyer and Agent minus the Base Membership and (ii) the
denominator of which is the Target Membership minus the Base Membership. The
amount that Shareholders are entitled to pursuant to this Section 2.3(f) is
referred to herein as the "Membership Cash Consideration."



(g) _Audit_. Within 60 days after the Closing, Buyer will cause KPMG
LLP/Norfolk ("KPMG") to prepare and deliver to Agent and Buyer, at the expense
of Buyer and Shareholders (provided that Shareholders shall not pay in excess
of $75,000 in the aggregate under this Section 2.3(g) and Section 5.4), an
audit report containing consolidated financial statements of the PHP Group for
the interim period from January 1, 2002 through the Closing Date, including, a
balance sheet as of the Closing Date, an income statement for the period from
January 1, 2002 through the Closing Date and related footnotes prepared in
accordance with GAAP (the "Closing Date Financial Statements") including,
among other statements and schedules, KPMGs unqualified opinion thereon. The
Actuary shall be utilized to provide the actuarial services required to
prepare the Closing Balance Sheet. In preparing the Closing Date Financial
Statements, the Company and KPMG shall consider all Medical Claims, accrued
expenses and other payables and claims primarily relating to the Business,
including, without limitation, those falling within the definition of Ordinary
Course of Business Claims. The actual amount of the Closing Book Value, as
well as the resulting Closing Balance Sheet, shall be set forth in a schedule
prepared by KPMG ("Closing Book Value Schedule") to be included within the
Closing Date Financial Statements. KPMG shall then issue a report on this
Closing Book Value Schedule. KPMG shall forward a copy of the Closing Book
Value Schedule to the parties with its report thereon with the Closing Date
Financial Statements. Any disagreement between Buyer and Agent regarding the
Closing Date Financial Statements, the Closing Book Value Schedule or the
Closing Balance Sheet will be resolved by Agent and Buyer selecting an
independent firm of certified public accountants of national reputation
("Second Accountants") to resolve the dispute. If Agent and Buyer are unable
to agree on the choice of Second Accountants, they will select a "Big 4"
accounting firm by lot (after excluding KPMG) as Second Accountants. The
parties shall have an opportunity to present their position to the
Second Accountants and shall cooperate with the Second Accountants in making
available to them any records or work papers requested by the Second
Accountants. After review of all

 

20 necessary records, work papers and presentations, the Second Accountants will
adopt and approve, either with or without modification, the Closing Date
Financial Statements, the Closing Book Value Schedule and the Closing Balance
Sheet with such modifications, if any will for all purposes be deemed to be
the Closing Date Financial Statements, the Closing Book Value Schedule and
the Closing Balance Sheet, as applicable. The decision of the Second
Accountants shall be set forth in writing and will be conclusive and binding
on the parties and subject to judicial enforcement. Each party shall bear one-
half of the cost of the Second Accountants. If the Closing Balance Sheet
shows a Closing Book Value of less than the Required Net Worth, then the
difference between such amounts shall be referred to as the "Actual Deficit."
If the Closing Balance Sheet shows a Closing Book Value of more than the
Required Net Worth, then the difference between such amounts shall be referred
to as the "Actual Excess." Within five Business Days after delivery of the
final Closing Balance Sheet, the following payments ("Net Worth Adjustment")
shall be made: (i) if there is an Actual Excess, and (x) if the amount of the
Actual Excess exceeded the Excess or there was a Deficit, then the difference
between the Actual Excess and the Excess or Deficit shall be paid immediately
by Buyer by wire transfer to Agent on behalf of Shareholders or (y) if the
amount of the Actual Excess was less than the Excess then the difference
between the Actual Excess and the Excess shall be paid immediately by Escrow
Agent out of the Escrowed Amount to Buyer by wire transfer; and (ii) if there
is an Actual Deficit, and (x) if the amount of the Actual Deficit exceeded the
Deficit or there was an Excess, then the difference between the Actual Deficit
and the Deficit or the Excess shall be paid immediately by Escrow Agent out
of the Escrowed Amount to Buyer by wire transfer or (y) if the amount of the
Actual Deficit was less than the Deficit, then the difference shall be paid
immediately by Buyer by wire transfer to Agent on behalf of Shareholders.
Further, unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, Newco Group
otherwise shall be responsible for completion of any required plan audit, and
the preparation and filing of any required Annual Report (IRS Form 5500 and
any related audit report) for Benefit Plans assumed by Newco Group prior to
Closing. Otherwise, the proper maintenance, operation, funding, auditing and
reporting of any Benefit Plan assumed by Newco Group shall be Newco Groups
responsibility, both for Plan Years arising prior to Closing and subsequent
years (except as to those plan contributions required from the Company for
periods prior to Closing).



(h) _True Up of Medical Claims_. As required in Section 5.12, beginning
on the sixth month anniversary of the Effective Time and continuing until the
next six-month anniversary thereof, Agent shall cause Newco Group to
recalculate the Medical Claims as of the Effective Time (but considering the
experience of the PHP Group with such Medical Claims after the
Effective Time, regardless of whether any such claim is an Ordinary Course of
Business Claim, and through each such anniversary date) (each six-month period
is hereafter called a "True Up Period"). With respect to each True Up Period,
Agent shall cause Newco Group to send to Buyer within 60 days of the end of
each six-month anniversary date its computation as to the amount of Medical
Claims as of the Effective Time, together with its work papers used to compute
the amount of Medical Claims (the "True Up Report"). In preparing the True Up
Report, Newco Group shall make such determinations consistent with the past
practices of the Company and shall consider all Medical Claims, including,
without limitation, those falling within the definition of Ordinary Course of
Business Claims. Within 30 days of receipt of such report (the "Review
Period"), Buyer will either accept the True Up Report or provide Agent with
written objections to such report. If Buyer accepts the True Up Report as
presented, then at the

 

21 end of the Review Period, the Report will be deemed final and binding on the
parties and will be subject only to the indemnification provisions of Article
VI. Any disagreement between Buyer and Agent that cannot be resolved by the
parties within 30 days after receipt of Buyers written objections, will be
resolved by KPMG. The parties shall have an opportunity to present their
position to KPMG and shall cooperate with KPMG in making available to them
any records or work papers requested by KPMG. The decision of KPMG shall be
set forth in writing and will be conclusive and binding on the parties and
subject to judicial enforcement. Each party shall bear one-half of the cost
of KPMG. Within five Business Days after such report becomes final, Agent
shall authorize the Escrow Agent to pay Buyer from the Holdback Escrow
Collateral the amount of Medical Claims as set forth in the True Up Report in
excess of the amount of Medical Claims, for which reserves are reflected on
the Closing Balance Sheet in the case of the first True Up Report, plus any
payment made by Shareholders during the first True Up Period under
the following sentence, and the amount of Medical Claims in the preceding
True Up Report, in the case of the second True Up Report, plus any payment
made by Shareholders during the second True Up Period under the following
sentence (collectively, the "Negative True Up Amount"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that at any time prior to the one-year anniversary of
the Effective Time, the payments of Medical Claims for which Shareholders are
responsible for hereunder exceeds the final amount determined as the
applicable reserve thereof on the Closing Balance Sheet, then the Shareholders
shall, within five business days of written demand by Buyer to Agent, pay to
Buyer an amount equal to such deficit. Likewise, Buyer shall pay the Agent
within five Business Days after such report becomes final for the benefit of
Shareholders the amount by which the Medical Claims, for which reserves are
reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet in the case of the first True
Up Report, or the previous True Up Report, in the case of the second True Up
Report, exceed the amount of Medical Claims in the subject True Up Report
(collectively, the "Positive True Up Amount").



(i) _True Up of Non-Medical Claims_. As required in Section 5.12, as of
the sixth month anniversary of the Effective Time, Agent shall cause Newco
Group to recalculate all claims primarily relating to the Business against the
PHP Group as of the Effective Time other than Medical Claims and Taxes (the
"Non-Medical Claims") as of the Effective Time (but considering the
experience of the PHP Group with such Non-Medical Claims after the Effective
Time and regardless of whether any such claim is an Ordinary Course of
Business Claim) and through such six-month anniversary date (the "Non-Medical
Claims True Up Period"). With respect to the Non-Medical True Up Period, Agent
shall cause Newco Group to send to Buyer within 60 days of the end of such
six-month anniversary date its computation as to the amount of Non-Medical
Claims as of the Effective Time, together with its work papers used to compute
the amount of Non-Medical Claims (the "Non-Medical Claims True Up Report"). In
preparing the Non-Medical Claims True Up Report, the Company and KPMG shall
consider all Non-Medical Claims, including, without limitation, those falling
within the definition of Ordinary Course of Business Claims. Within 30 days of
receipt of such report (the "Non-Medical Claims Review Period"), Buyer
will either accept the Non-Medical Claims True Up Report or provide Agent
with written objections to such report. If Buyer accepts the Non-Medical Claim
True Up Report as presented, then at the end of the Non-Medical Claims Review
Period, such report will be deemed final and binding on the parties and will
be subject only to the indemnification provisions of Article VI. Any
disagreement between Buyer and Agent that cannot be resolved by the parties
within 30 days after receipt of Buyers written objections, will be resolved
by

 

22 KPMG. The parties shall have the opportunity to present their positions to
KPMG and shall cooperate with KPMG in making available to them any records or
work papers requested by KPMG. The decision of KPMG shall be set forth in
writing and will be conclusive and binding on the parties subject to judicial
enforcement. Each party shall bear one-half of the cost of KPMG. Within five
Business Days after such report becomes final, Agent shall authorize the
Escrow Agent to pay Buyer from the Holdback Escrow Collateral the amount of
Non-Medical Claims as set forth in the Non-Medical Claims True Up Report in
excess of the amount of Non-Medical Claims, for which reserves are reflected
on the Closing Balance Sheet (the "Non-Medical Claims Negative True Up
Amount"). Likewise, Buyer shall pay the Agent for the benefit of Shareholders
within five Business Days after such report becomes final the amount by which
the Non-Medical Claims for which there are reserves reflected on the Closing
Balance Sheet exceed the amount of Non-Medical Claims in the Non-Medical
Claims True Up Report (collectively, the "Non-Medical Claims Positive True Up
Amount").



(j) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. In the event of any
reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares of Company
capital stock, reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to shares of Company capital stock occurring (or for which a record
date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Statutory
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted to
reflect fully such event.



(k) _No Further Ownership Rights in Stock_. The Aggregate
Consideration paid to Shareholders upon the surrender for exchange of
certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
capital stock, and from and after the Statutory Effective Time there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of
the shares of Company capital stock which were outstanding immediately prior
to the Statutory Effective Time. If, after the Statutory Effective Time,
certificates are presented to Company or the Agent for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and such Shareholder shall receive his, hers or its allocated
share of the Aggregate Consideration.



Section 2.4 _ Closing_.



(a) Upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the consummation of
the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place on the calendar day in which the
Statutory Effective Time shall occur at the offices of Akerman, Senterfitt and
Eidson, P.A., SunTrust International Center, One Southeast Third Avenue, 28th
Floor, Miami, Florida 33131 which shall be on the last day of the
calendar month which is at least five Business Days following the
satisfaction or waiver of the last to occur of the conditions to the
obligations of the parties set forth in Article VII, or at such other location
or on such other date as is mutually agreeable to Buyer and Agent. The date
of the Closing is herein referred to as the "Closing Date." All actions with
respect to the Closing shall be deemed to take place simultaneously.



 

(b) At the Closing, Agent shall, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, deliver or cause to be delivered
to Buyer: (i) stock certificates evidencing the Shares, duly endorsed in
blank by Shareholders or accompanied by stock powers duly executed

 

23 in blank by Shareholders (except for certificates representing Dissenting
Shares); (ii) all other documents and certificates required under Article VII
of this Agreement to be delivered by Shareholders, the Company or Newco Group
to Buyer at or before the Closing Date in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iii) such consents required under other Contracts to
the change of control of the PHP Group, including landlord estoppels, as the
Company is able to obtain using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain same
with the assistance of Buyer. Obtaining the consents and landlord estoppels
referenced in Section 2.4(b)(iii) is not a condition to Closing nor shall it
give rise to any liability on the part of Shareholders or the Company
whatsoever. No interest will be paid or accrued on any sums payable to holders
of certificates. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.4(b), each stock certificate evidencing the Shares (other than
certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes
only the right to receive the Aggregate Consideration provided for by this
Agreement, without interest. Other than the payment to Agent as provided in
Section 2.4(c) below, Buyer shall have no liability or obligation whatsoever
with respect to the payment to holders of the Shares for such
holders allocated share of the Aggregate Consideration.



(c) At Closing, Buyer shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Article VII: (i) deliver and pay cash to Agent for the benefit of
Shareholders the sum of the Closing Cash Amount, the Membership Cash
Consideration plus the Excess or minus the Deficit, as the case may be; (ii)
deliver to the Escrow Agent cash in an amount equal to the Escrow Amount,
which shall secure the payment of Shareholders indemnification obligations
hereunder and which shall be held in escrow and disbursed in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement; and (iii) deliver all other documents and
certificates required under Article VII of this Agreement to be delivered by
Buyer or Parent to Shareholders at or before the Closing Date in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby.

its obligations hereunder. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally
binding obligation of such Shareholder, enforceable in accordance with its

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally; and
(ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of

or, if Shareholder is an entity, any provision of its charter, bylaws or other

other contracts or commitments that could require the Company, PHPI or any
Excluded Subsidiary to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any capital

the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this
Agreement and each of the documents and instruments required to be entered
into pursuant to this Agreement (including without limitation the Articles of

the requisite approval of the Companys Board of Directors was obtained at a
Board of Directors meeting held August 15, 2002 and the requisite approval of
Shareholders was obtained by the receipt of written consents from Shareholders
on August 21, 2002. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company. Assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Buyer, this Agreement is or will be the legal, valid and binding

its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
generally; and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and
other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be

47 in the ordinary course of business. If the Closing Date does not occur on
December 31, the Agent may not make an election described in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(iii) without the consent of
Buyer. The Tax Returns of the Company and any other member of the PHP Group

hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, elect with the
relevant governmental authority to treat (i) the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date (hereinafter referred to as the "Companys
Tax Period") for all purposes as a short taxable period ending as of the
close of the Closing Date and such short taxable period shall be treated as a
Pre-Closing Tax Period for purposes of this Agreement and (ii) the portion of
the Straddle Period after the Closing Date (hereafter referred to as the
"Buyers Tax Period") shall be treated as a Post-Closing Tax Period for
purposes of this Agreement. In any case where applicable laws do not permit
such an election to be made, then, for purposes of this Agreement, Taxes for
the Straddle Period shall be allocated between the Companys Tax Period and
the Buyers Tax Period using an interim-closing-of-the-books method assuming
that the Companys Tax Period is taxable period ending at the close of
business on the Closing Date. In the case of any real property, personal
property or other ad valorem Tax, the amount of such Tax allocated to
Companys Tax Period shall be the amount of that Tax for the entire Taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Taxable period.



(h) _Straddle Period Returns_. The Buyer shall cause the Company to
prepare and file all Tax Returns and pay all Taxes due, if any, by the
Company with respect to any Straddle Period for which it is responsible to pay
Taxes in whole or in part; _provided, however_ , that the Agent shall have a
reasonable opportunity to review all such Tax Returns and amendments thereto
prior to the filing thereof by the Buyer. Upon fifteen (15) days notice from
the Buyer, the Shareholders shall pay to the Buyer the Taxes attributable to
the Companys Tax Period to the extent such Taxes are not reflected as
liabilities on the Closing Balance Sheet on or before the second business day
prior to the due date for the payment of such Taxes by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Buyer.

 



(i) _Cooperation_. The Agent and the Parent shall make available to the
other, as reasonably requested, all information, records or documents in
their possession relating to Tax liabilities of the Company for all Tax
periods of the Company ending on, prior to or including

 

48 the Closing Date and shall preserve all such information, records and
documents until the later of five years from the Closing Date or the
expiration of any applicable Tax statute of limitations or extensions thereof;
_provided, however_ , that if a proceeding has been instituted for which the
information, records or documents is required prior to the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, such information, records or documents
shall be retained until there is a final determination with respect to such
proceeding. After the end of such five-year period, the expiration of
the applicable Tax statute of limitations or final determination, as
applicable, Buyer and Agent on behalf of Shareholders, may dispose of such
information, books and records and documents but before their disposition, a
party shall give the other party the opportunity to take possession of them.
Any information obtained in accordance with this Section 5.3(i) shall be kept
confidential by the parties, unless and only to the extent that disclosure is
required by law, legal process or regulatory authority. Whenever a Tax
authority begins a Tax audit, asserts a claim, makes an assessment or
otherwise disputes the amount of Tax for which a party is or may be liable to
the other party under this Section 5.3, that other party shall
promptly inform the party so liable.



(j) _Buyer Contest_. After the Closing Date, the Buyer and the Company
shall have exclusive control over and responsibility to represent the
Companys interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding (a
" Buyer Contest") with respect to all Post-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle
Periods of the Company (or Straddle Period pertaining to a Buyers Tax Period)
and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; provided that, the Buyer
may not agree to any settlement or compromise of any such Buyer Contest if
such settlement or compromise will give rise to an indemnification obligation
of the Shareholders or would affect a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Companys Tax
Period, without the prior consent of the Agent which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company and the Buyer and the
Shareholders agree to cooperate fully with each other with respect to
defending or answering any Buyer Contest and to provide each other with all
materials, information and documents as reasonably requested by the other.
The Shareholders and the Buyer covenant to negotiate and defend any Buyer
Contest in good faith.



(k) _Shareholder Contest_. After the Closing Date, the Shareholders
through the Agent shall have exclusive control over and responsibility to
represent the Companys interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding (a "Shareholder Contest") with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; provided that, the
Agent may not agree to any settlement or compromise of any such Shareholder
Contest if such settlement or compromise will give rise to an indemnification
obligation of the Buyer and Parent, will result in a Tax liability that will
be ultimately borne by Buyer or Parent under Section 5.3(o) because the
adjustment would have resulted in a deferred tax asset on the Closing Balance
Sheet or would affect a Post-Closing Tax Period or Buyer Tax Period without
the prior consent of Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. The Company and the Buyer and the Shareholders agree to cooperate
fully with each other with respect to defending or answering any Shareholder
Contest and to provide each other with all materials, information
and documents as reasonably requested by the other. The Shareholders and the
Buyer covenant to negotiate and defend any Shareholder Contest in good faith.

 

49 (l) _Refunds_.



(i) To the extent requested by Agent and at the sole expense of
Shareholders, Buyer will (or cause the Company to) as promptly as practicable
claim any refund relating to Taxes paid by the Company or any member of the
PHP Group with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Company Tax Period or
that appeared as a liability on the Closing Balance Sheet or for which
Shareholders are responsible under Section 5.3(c) and which were paid to a
Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with a claim for indemnification under
Section 5.3(c). If, after the Closing Date, the Shareholders receive
any refund relating to Taxes for which Buyer and the Company are responsible
under Section 5.3(d) and which were paid to Shareholders in connection with a
claim for indemnification under Section 5.3(d), the Shareholders shall
promptly transfer the amount of such refund to Buyer. If, after the Closing
Date, Buyer or Company receives any refund of Taxes (a) that were paid by the
Company or any member of the PHP Group with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Company Tax Period, or (b) that appeared as a liability on the
Closing Balance Sheet, or (c) for which Shareholders are responsible under
Section 5.3(c) and which were paid to a Buyer Indemnified Party in connection
with a claim for indemnification under Section 5.3(c), then the Buyer or the
Company shall promptly transfer the amount of such Tax refund to the
Shareholders without setoffs or counterclaims. For purposes of this Section
5.3, refunds of Tax include refunds of estimated Tax and tentative refunds of
Tax under Section 6411 of the Code.



(ii) Buyer and Shareholders will equitably apportion any refund or credit
with respect to Taxes (and related expenses) for any Straddle Period in
accordance with the principles of Section 5.3(g) only if the Company reflected
a portion of such Taxes as a liability or reserve (other than for deferred
Taxes) on the Closing Balance Sheet, or if the Shareholders paid such refunded
or credited Tax to a Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with a claim for
indemnification under Section 5.3(g) or (h).



(iii) Except as expressly set forth in Section 5.3(c), 5.3(l)(i) or (ii),
Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to receive and retain any refunds
relating to Taxes attributable to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
or Straddle Period. If requested by Buyer or Company and at the sole expense
of Buyer or Company, Shareholders shall cooperate with Buyer or Company and,
if applicable, claim any refund relating to such Taxes and promptly transfer
the amount thereof to Buyer or Company upon receipt thereof. Notwithstanding
this Section 5.3(l)(iii) to the contrary, Buyer may not carry-back a Tax
attribute from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without
the consent of Agent.



(iv) It is the intention of the parties in Section 5.3(l)(i) and (ii) and
Section 5.3(c) that the Shareholders shall be entitled to refunds of Tax with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent such Tax was previously
paid under a claim for indemnification, the Tax was taken into account as a
liability in the Closing Balance Sheet in computing Closing Book Value or the
Tax was not

 

50 reflected as an Asset (including in deferred tax assets) on such Closing
Balance Sheet. It is not the intention of the parties that the Shareholders
shall be effectively paid twice for the same Asset. For example, if a refund
is received as a result of an adjustment to accrued expenses on a return for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period and such accrued expenses gave rise to a deferred tax
asset on the Closing Balance Sheet, the Shareholders shall not be entitled to
such refund because the refund was previously credited to the Shareholders in
the calculation of the Aggregate Consideration in accordance with Sections
2.3(b), (e) and (g).



(m) _Shareholder Liability_. Each Shareholder shall be responsible for a
share of the total liability to a Buyer Indemnified Party under Section 5.3(c)
equal to the percentage of the total Shares owned by such Shareholder on the
Closing Date multiplied by the amount of such total liability _provided,
however_ , that in no event shall the amount exceed the Purchase Price
actually received by such Shareholder. Agent guarantees payment of the
liability of each other Shareholder hereunder and a Buyer Indemnified Party
may recover from Agent any liability of Shareholders to the Buyer Indemnified
Party under Section 5.3(c) without first proceeding against particular
Shareholders.



(n) _Buyer Liability_. The Company, PHPI and Buyer shall be jointly and
severally liable for any indemnification obligation of Buyer to Shareholders
under Section 5.3(d) and obligations to pay Tax refunds to Shareholders under
Section 5.3(c), 5.3(l)(i) or (ii).



(o) _Tax Benefit or Detriment_. Any payment by Shareholders to a Buyer
Indemnified Party under Section 5.3(c) shall be decreased by any Tax benefit
realized by the Buyer Indemnified Party from payment of the Taxes or other
items with respect to which the payment is made and increased by any Tax
detriment of the Buyer Indemnified Party, the PHP Group or Buyer arising from
receipt of the indemnity payment. If any adjustment, event or circumstance
giving rise to a payment under Section 5.3(c) also gives rise to a Tax benefit
to the Buyer Indemnified Party, except as provided herein, the payment by
Shareholders to the Buyer Indemnified Party under Section 5.3(c) shall be
reduced by such Tax benefit. For example, payments to Buyer for interest on
any Tax deficiency shall be net of any Tax benefit to the PHP Group after the
Closing Date attributable to the deductibility of such interest. In further
example, if a deduction in a Pre-Closing Tax Period is disallowed as a result
of a Shareholder Contest but is instead allowed as a deduction to Buyer or the
PHP Group in a Post-Closing Tax Period or Buyer Tax Period, the Shareholders
liability to Buyer under Section 5.3(c) shall be reduced by the Tax benefit
to Buyer or the PHP Group. For purposes of this Section 5.3(o), the Tax
benefit realized by the Buyer Indemnified Party or the PHP Group shall be
presumed to equal the product of (i) the amount of the Tax or other item or
adjustment allowed as a deduction to Parent or the PHP Group, and (ii) the
combined maximum federal and state corporate income tax rate (taking into
account the deductibility such taxes) with the state rate presumed to be the
rate in the State of Florida. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.3(o), a Tax or other item or adjustment (other than interest on
a Tax deficiency) shall be considered to give rise to a Tax benefit of zero
unless the entire Tax or other item or adjustment is deductible or
recoverable within 12 months after the Closing Date on a Tax Return of the
Company, Buyer. or the PHP Group in a Post-Closing Tax Period and would have
given rise to a deferred tax asset in calculating Closing Book Value included
on the Closing Balance Sheet. For example, if a Tax item that was deducted in
a Pre-Closing Tax Period is required to be capitalized and deducted or

 

51 amortized in a Post-Closing Tax Period by the Company, the PHP Group or Parent
over a period exceeding 12 months following the Closing Date, the Tax benefit
shall be presumed to be zero for the entire Tax item. Notwithstanding the
preceding two sentences to the contrary, if a Tax or other item or adjustment
would be deductible or recoverable within 12 months after the Closing Date
without regard to Section 481 of the Code but the item is deductible or
recoverable over more than 12 months by reason of Section 481, the Tax benefit
to the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be the present value of such Tax benefit
with the discount rate equal to Parents average cost of funds in the first
Post-Closing Tax Period of Buyer following the Closing Date.



(p) _Procedure_. Neither the Buyer, the Company nor PHPI, nor the
successors or assigns of any of such corporations, will extend the applicable
Tax statute of limitations for any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the express
written consent of Agent. After the Closing Date, neither the Buyer nor the
Company without the prior, express written consent of Agent, will take any
action which would cause the Company to cease to be the designated agent of
the PHP Group within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-77 and
1.1502-77A for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, _provided, however_ , that the
Company may take such action if a substitute designated agent is selected by
Agent and approved by IRS in accordance with such regulations and Revenue
Procedure 2002-43 (or any applicable subsequent revenue procedure). Buyer and
the Company agree to execute any documents reasonably requested by Agent in
order for the Shareholders or Agent to carry out Section 5.3(e), (f), (l)(i)
and this (p) including but not limited to Form 2848 (power of attorney) or
other documents authorizing Agent (or designees of Agent) to execute Tax
Returns, to receive Tax refunds or to represent the Company or PHPI in any
Shareholder Contest.



(q) _Survival_. The obligations of the parties set forth in this Section
5.3 shall be unconditional and absolute and shall remain in effect until
ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of
limitations.



(r) _Effect of Payments_. Any additional payment made to Shareholders by
or on behalf of Buyer under this Section 5.3 or under the other provisions of
this Agreement, including Section 2.3(e), Section 5.10 and Section 6.1, are
intended by the parties to be an adjustment to the purchase price. Any
additional payment made to a Buyer Indemnified Party or the Company by
Shareholders under this Section 5.3 or under the other provisions of this
Agreement are intended to be a nontaxable reduction of the Buyers
purchase price which does not constitute a Tax detriment under this
Agreement. The parties agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with this
Section 5.3(r).



Section 5.4 _ Audited Financial Information_. Shareholders acknowledge
that Parent is a "reporting company" pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Parent may file or include in its
filings with the SEC (the "Securities Filings") the financial statements for
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis to the extent
required under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. At the reasonable request of Parent (or its successor in interest)
at any time during the Parents three reporting years following the Closing,
Agent shall use his commercially reasonable efforts to deliver promptly
such assurances, representation letters and/or opinions of KPMG regarding the
Financial Information as may be required by the rules and regulations of the
SEC for the use of

 

52 such statements in the Securities Filings. To the extent required under the
applicable SEC rules and regulations, Agent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare and to have audited (to the extent required under such SEC
rules and regulations) any supplemental or revised special purpose reports
that the SEC may require for the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis. Such reports may include: (i) the Companys and its
Subsidiaries most recent fiscal years audited financial statements
(accompanied by related footnotes and footnote disclosure which may require
the segregation of the financial results of the Business and the Excluded
Business), (ii) unless Closing occurs on December 31, 2002, the Companys and
its Subsidiaries unaudited financial statements for the period January
1 through the most recent fiscal quarter before Closing accompanied by the
required footnotes and/or footnote disclosure, (iii) an audited consolidated
balance sheet and statement of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the period January 1 through the most recent fiscal quarter before
Closing, and (iv) such other data from the books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and of the PHP Group as may be
required by the SEC. Agent shall also provide to Buyer or KPMG such other
representation letters, comfort letters, supporting schedules and such other
documentation as may reasonably and customarily be required by accountants or
by underwriters in connection with firm commitment offerings. All such
information provided pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to KPMG, Buyer and such underwriters. Buyer
shall make information in its possession pertaining to the Company and
the Subsidiaries reasonably available to the Agent or KPMG or other
representatives. Shareholders shall pay the fees and expenses of KPMG incurred
in connection with the preparation and delivery of the information required by
this Section 5.4 up to a maximum of $75,000 in the aggregate under this
Section and Section 2.3(g); thereafter Parent shall be responsible for all
such fees and expenses.



Section 5.5 _ Publicity_. Upon execution of this Agreement and at
Closing, the parties will issue press releases in the form prepared by Buyer,
subject to the written approval of Agent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Except as permitted in Section 5.04 above and this
Section 5.5 and except as required by law, neither Shareholders, the Company,
nor Buyer nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue any press release
or any other public statement or any correspondence or other communication
with respect to the execution and Closing of this Agreement unless the other
party shall have had the prior opportunity to review and comment thereon and
such release or statement has been consented to by such party. Except as
permitted in Section 5.4 above and this Section 5.5, neither Buyer, the
Company nor Shareholders nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or any correspondence or
other communication with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other party, except as
may be required by law. In this regard, Shareholders acknowledge Parents
reporting and disclosure obligations under the Exchange Act, other federal
and state securities laws and case interpretations of such laws, whether as
reported in its Securities Filings or in its everyday discussions with
securities analysts, Shareholders and the press, but such requirements shall
not release Parent from its obligations set forth in the preceding sentence.

 

53 Section 5.6 _ Approvals and Consents; Cooperation; Notification_.



(a) Buyer and the Company shall use (and the Company shall cause PHPI, the
Excluded Subsidiaries and Newco Group to use) their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable (i) all consents of Governmental
Entities and (ii) consents of all other third parties necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall use, and it
shall cause PHPI, the Excluded Subsidiaries and Newco Group to
use, commercially reasonable efforts, and Buyer agrees to cooperate fully
with the Company, to obtain as promptly as practicable consents of Payors and
other third parties under the Material Agreements to the change of control of
the PHP Group. 



(b) Each of the parties shall give any notices to make any filings and use
their respective best efforts to obtain any authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers, and to respond as promptly as practicable to any
inquiries received from any Governmental Entity which are required to be
given, made or obtained in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Within five days of the date
hereof, each of the parties will file (and the Company will cause each member
of the Consolidated Group to file) any Notification and Report Forms and
related material that it may be required to file with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, will use their respective best
efforts to obtain a waiver from the applicable waiting period, and will make
any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or
advisable in connection therewith. Each of the parties shall bear its own
costs and expenses in preparing such filings; provided that Buyer shall pay
all filing fees in connection therewith. Within five days after the date of
execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall, and the Company shall cause Newco
Group to, make the required filings with the DOI with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and the Company shall promptly
make any and all other filings and submissions of information which are
required or requested in order to obtain the approvals required by any
Governmental Entity to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer
and the Company shall keep each other fully apprised of their respective
actions with respect to all filings and submissions and shall provide each
other with copies of such filings and submissions prior to filing with the
appropriate agency. Each of the parties shall bear its own costs and expenses
in preparing such filings.



(c) Buyer and Shareholders shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any requisite regulatory approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.



(d) Each of Shareholders and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the other of
the occurrence or failure to occur of an event that would, or, with the lapse
of time would, cause any condition to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby not to be satisfied.



(e) To facilitate an effective transition of the Business to Buyers
control, the Parties agree that at all times before the Closing Date, the PHP
Group shall:

  

54 (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to orient, educate and otherwise
train Buyer and permit Buyers employees to work with the employees of Company
and its Subsidiaries after the execution of this Agreement and before Closing
regarding (A) the PHP Groups current operating policies and procedures (to
facilitate continuity of administration), (B) the health plan benefits and
services offered by the PHP Group to the Members including, without
limitation, member services, member outreach and education, and preventative
medicine programs, (C) the Providers and Provider Agreements, (D) the Payors
and Payor Contracts and (E) the PHP Groups medical management policies and
procedures, (F) the operations of the Business and (G) the orientation and
training of the Designated Employees on Buyers systems and procedures;
provided Buyers employees do not disrupt, interfere with or adversely affect
the Business or the Excluded Business; and



(ii) grant Buyer reasonable access to and provide reasonable assistance to
Buyer to allow Buyer to interface with the phone information network used by
the PHP Group in connection with the Business and use commercially reasonable
efforts to make available to Buyer, in all media reasonably available, such
information as may reasonably prepare the PHP Group to continue to pay claims
arising under the Provider Agreements after the Closing Date and otherwise
operate the Business.



Section 5.7 _ Use of Names_. At Closing, Shareholders shall cause Newco
Group and the Excluded Subsidiaries to cease using any and all trademarks,
trade names, logotypes, trade dress and other intangible rights owned or used
by the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates primarily in the Business. At
Closing, Shareholders shall cause the Excluded Subsidiaries to transfer and
assign to PHPI any Intellectual Property and other intangibles owned or used
by the Excluded Subsidiaries which is used primarily in the Business. Buyer
shall cause the PHP Group to cease using any and all trade names, trademarks,
logos and trade dress owned by the Company or its Affiliates and primarily
used in the conduct of the Excluded Businesses conducted by the Excluded
Subsidiaries.



Section 5.8 _ Further Assurances_. Each party agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining new signature cards for
all of the PHP Groups bank accounts.



Section 5.9 _ Conditions_. Buyer and the Company covenant and agree
that, subject to the provisions of Articles VII and VIII hereof, if any event
should occur, either within or without the control of any party hereto, that
would prevent fulfillment of the conditions of any party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the parties shall each use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cure the event as expeditiously as
possible; _provided, however_ , that in the case of such event, neither party
shall have any obligation to take any action not specifically required by the
terms of this Agreement to cure such event that is unduly burdensome or that
would have a Material Adverse Effect on such party or the Business, taken as
a whole.

 

55 Section 5.10 _ Collection of Receivables, Other Assets_.



(a) Buyer shall cause the PHP Group to use commercially reasonable efforts
to collect the Receivables, which efforts shall not include a requirement to
pay any attorneys fees or out of pocket costs. In the event that the PHP
Group shall not have collected the amount of Receivables, net of any reserve
for bad debt, set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet by the 120th day after
the Effective Time, Buyer at its option, may assign such uncollected
Receivables to Shareholders and Shareholders shall cause Escrow Agent to
distribute from the Escrow Amount to the PHP Group the difference between the
amount of Receivables, net of any reserve for bad debts, on the Closing
Balance Sheet, and the amount of Receivables collected by the PHP Group after
Closing.



(b) If Buyer or Parent collects any Excluded Assets from any third party
after Closing, or if Shareholders, any Excluded Subsidiary or Newco
Group collects any Assets from any third party after Closing, then Buyer or
Parent (as the case may be) shall deliver to Agent or Newco Group, or vice
versa as the case may be, such property as soon as reasonably practicable
after receipt thereof. 



Section 5.11 _ Revised Disclosure Schedule_.



(a) The Company shall deliver to Buyer such revised forms of the
Disclosure Schedule or updated information for addition to or inclusion in the
Disclosure Schedule as are necessary to reflect changes in such Disclosure
Schedule as of the Closing Date. Except as provided in Section 5.11(b) below,
in addition to changes that are permitted or contemplated by the terms of this
Agreement, any changes in the Disclosure Schedule as so delivered by the
Company will be binding on Buyer if Closing occurs.

 



(b) The Company shall be entitled to add new Contracts or amendments and
extensions of existing Contracts to the Disclosure Schedule to be continued
by the PHP Group after the Closing, so long as such Contracts, amendments or
extensions are consistent in all material respects with the PHP Groups past
practices. The Company will exercise good faith efforts to provide a monthly
list of all new Contracts and new amendments and extensions to existing
Contracts (and all copies requested by Buyer) to Buyer. All Contracts,
amendments thereto and renewals thereof entered into in the ordinary course
of business and consistent in all material respects with the past practices of
the PHP Group, except as follows shall be deemed accepted by Buyer. The
following Contracts executed by the PHP Group after the date hereof and on
or before the Closing Date require the written consent of Buyer (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld): (i) any new Material Agreements
or amendments, renewals or extensions to existing Material Agreements (other
than Provider Agreements or Multi-Party Provider Agreements), (ii) any new
Provider Agreement that includes one or more of the provisions set forth in
Section 3.18(c) or any amendments, renewals or extensions to existing Provider
Agreements that violate one or more of the provisions set forth in Section
3.18(c) (both except with respect to Section 3.18(c)(v), which shall apply
only for such Contracts with more than one thousand (1,000)) Members)
("Noncompliant Provider Agreements"), (iii) the bifurcation of any existing
Multi-Party Provider Agreement into separate Provider Agreements pursuant to
Section 5.13 which involve any rate change or change in material term for the

 

56 Business, (iv) any amendments, renewals or extensions to any existing Multi-
Party Provider Agreement that involve any rate increases of more than 10%
from the existing Multi-Party Provider Agreement, (v) any amendments, renewals
or extensions of existing Material Provider Agreements that involve any rate
increase of more than 10% from the existing Material Provider Agreement, and
(vi) any new Material Provider Agreements that contain rates of more than 10%
greater than the highest rate then in effect for any similar Provider. Buyer
must provide Agent with written notice within five Business Days after receipt
of a written notice from the Company regarding any such Contract which is
proposed to be added to the Disclosure Schedule of its election to either
consent or not to consent to such Contracts. If Buyer fails to timely notify
Agent in writing of its election, Buyer shall be deemed to have made the
election to consent to such Contract. If the additional cost to the PHP Group
of all Contracts not consented to by Buyer (as required pursuant to this
Section 5.11(b)) (but entered into by the PHP Group) equals or exceeds $1
million, Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement. The Company
shall have no liability with respect to the execution of such Contracts if the
Closing occurs.



(c) The Executive Committee of the PHP Group will be the governing body who
is responsible for the review of Contracts entered into by the PHP Group. A
representative of Buyer shall be entitled to participate, in a nonvoting
capacity, in its review of new Contracts or renewals, amendments or
terminations of any Contract (to the extent reviewed by the Executive
Committee consistent with past practices) by the Executive Committee of the
PHP Group and in all meetings, discussions and telephone conferences with
respect to review of Contracts by such Committee before Closing.



Section 5.12 _ Runout_. Subject to the provisions hereof, Shareholders
shall cause Newco Group for a period of 12 months after Closing to be
responsible for administrating and paying all Medical Claims and Non-
Medical Claims, including the provision of all services necessary to timely
ascertain the correct amount of each such claim, and Newco Group shall pay
each Medical Claim before the date required by Florida law or the applicable
Payor Contract, subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(h) and other claims
before the date required by the applicable Contract. Newco Group shall
continue the administration and payment of runout Medical Claims for a period
equal to the longer of the term granted by the applicable Payor Contract or
Florida regulations and law regarding timely filing and timely appeals and the
contractual provisions in force with the Provider for a period of 12 months.
Newco Group shall continue the administration and payment of trade payables
for a period of 12 months after Closing. Newco Group will provide Buyer with
monthly detailed claims files no later than the fifth Business Day of the
month following each claims processing period. Newco Group shall provide
such detailed claims files in a format as agreed upon by both Newco Group and
Buyer. Buyer will fund a designated bank account of PHPI in an amount equal to
the payment of Medical Claims and Non-Medical Claims to be made by Newco Group
from such bank account at least one business day before such payments are to
be made, _provided_ Newco Group e-mails or transmits by facsimile to Buyer the
schedule of payments to be made detailing the check number, check date, payee
and check amount by 5:00 PM at least one business day before the date of
payment. Newco shall release all payments to vendors within one day of the
check date indicated on the request for payment. Shareholders shall require
Newco Group to pay runout Medical Claims and Non-Medical Claims, in
accordance with established claims payment practices of the PHP Group prior to
sale. Buyer reserves the right to reasonably monitor and review the
administration of the runout Medical Claims and Non-Medical
Claims. Shareholders shall cause Newco Group not to

 

57 settle any material disputed Medical Claim or Non-Medical Claims without
Buyers consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Newco Group shall furnish Buyer the necessary information in electronic files
to allow Buyer to prepare 1099s and 1096s for all vendors of PHP Group paid by
the Newco Group during the runout period. In the event that at any time prior
to the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time, the payments of Medical
Claims for which Shareholders are responsible for hereunder exceeds the final
amount determined as the applicable reserve thereof on the Closing Balance
Sheet, then the Shareholders shall, within five business days of written
demand by Buyer to Agent, pay to Buyer an amount equal to such deficit. Such
funds shall be delivered to PHPI to pay such Medical Claims in accordance with
the provisions hereof.

 



Section 5.13 _ Assignment of Interests in Contracts_. At or before
Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
PHP Group to retain the benefits of each Contract after the Closing,
including without limitation the Multi-Party Provider Agreements, related to
the Business which are entered into by one or more Affiliates of the PHP
Group, without the PHP Group being a party through the remainder of the stated
term and extensions thereof agreed to by Buyer. In the case of Multi-Party
Provider Agreements to which the PHP Group is a party, the PHP Group and
Shareholders will act so Newco Group shall receive the benefits related to the
Excluded Business of such contracts on the terms thereof on the Closing Date
through the remainder of the stated term and extensions thereof agreed to by
Newco Group after Closing. The Multi-Party Provider Agreements are set forth
on _Schedule 5.13 [OMITTED_ ]. The Company and Buyer shall make a good faith
effort to obtain the consent of third parties to Contracts requiring written
consent of the Merger and, in any event, shall assign the benefit of any
Contract requiring consent which is not obtained and all non-assignable
Contracts to the PHP Group or its designee. With respect to Multi-Party
Provider Agreements with Affiliates of the PHP Group, the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the PHP Group to negotiate and enter
into before Closing, new contracts between PHPI and those Providers who are
parties to Multi-Party Provider Agreements, so that each such Contract is
between PHPI and a Provider and applicable to the Medicaid Business, the FHK
Business and/or the Summit Business. Buyer agrees such new agreements shall
not terminate or affect the obligations and benefits of the Company and PHPI
under existing Multi-Party Provider Agreements. At Buyers option, Newco Group
and/or the Excluded Subsidiaries shall enter into new Provider Agreements
with Providers on identical terms to the provisions governing the Excluded
Business portion of the Multi-Party Provider Agreement with respect to the
Excluded Business so long as the PHP Group retains, enters into or amends
such Multi-Party Provider Agreement to become a Provider Agreement applicable
to the Provider and the PHP Group with respect to the Business exclusively.



Section 5.14 _ Transition_.



(a) Buyer intends to transition the Business to its systems and to take
over provider relations, claims management and administration, member/provider
services, enrollment, reporting and other services to conduct the Business
after the Effective Time. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
in order to expand its operations and hire personnel sufficient to conduct the
Business after the Effective Time, in as timely a manner as reasonably
possible, and, in all events, will complete such expansion and hiring and
notify Agent thereof by December 15, 2002.

 

58 (b) Newco Group shall provide transition services to Buyer and the PHP
Group after Closing (including TPA servicing) pursuant to the Administrative
Services Agreement attached as _Exhibit L [OMITTED_ ].



Section 5.15 _ Employees; Benefit Plans_.



(a) Neither Shareholders, the Company nor any Subsidiary shall make any
commitments to any of the PHP Groups employees with respect to their
continued employment by the PHP Group after the Closing Date. It is the
intention of Buyer to interview the PHP Group employees listed on _Schedule
5.15 [OMITTED_ ] for continued employment with the PHP Group after Closing.
The Company shall, upon Buyers request, assist Buyer as Buyer deems
appropriate, in interviewing and retaining or rehiring any of such employees
at or after the Closing Date. Buyer shall notify the Company by October 15,
2002 of those employees on _Schedule 5.15 [OMITTED_ ] that Buyer on behalf of
the PHP Group will offer to retain after Closing (the
"Designated Employees"). Any employees of the PHP Group which Buyer does not
offer to retain or who do not accept such offer will be terminated by the PHP
Group at or before Closing. All liabilities related to such terminations,
except Excluded Termination Claims and claims with respect to terminations of
any Designated Employees that Buyer elects not to have the PHP Group continue
to employ after Closing Date, will be paid by the PHP Group before Closing or
reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet. The PHP Group shall make available
to Buyer the Designated Employees for reasonable training purposes before
Closing, as provided in Section 5.6(e)(i)(G). Without any increase in salaries
or other compensation except increases and bonuses which the PHP Group elects
to award before Closing as provided in Section 5.1, the PHP Group shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to retain the Designated Employees through
the Closing. Buyer and the PHP Group shall co-manage the severance of all
other employees of the PHP Group who are primarily employed in the Business
and whose employment shall not be continued by the PHP Group after Closing.
The PHP Group shall pay severance pay equal to one months salary to any such
employee on the date of such employees termination of employment on or after
the Closing Date provided that Buyer shall add the amount of such severance
pay and related employment taxes and benefits payable by the PHP Group,
reduced by the Tax benefit of such payments as determined under Section
5.3(o), to the Aggregate Consideration and Closing Cash Amount. Such severance
pay shall be paid by the PHP Group on the condition that the employee to whom
it is payable shall sign a release (and deliver same to the PHP Group) in a
form acceptable to Buyer in its discretion.



(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company, PHPI or other sponsoring PHP Group employer shall terminate each and
every PHP Group Benefit Plan prior to Closing (by formal Board action of the
appropriate sponsoring PHP Group employer); _provided, however_ that PHPI or
any other sponsoring PHP Group employer shall not terminate any Benefit Plan
providing health, medical or dental benefits to the employees of PHPI or
other PHP Group employer until Buyer has implemented a Benefit Plan providing
such benefits to the employees of PHPI or other PHP Group employer (which
terminations shall be deemed effective as of the Closing Dates). With respect
to each Benefit Plan that is terminated pursuant to this Section 5.15(b), the
sponsoring PHP Group employer shall amend such Plan (by appropriate Board
action of the sponsor before transfer) before

 

59 Closing to provide full vesting of all benefits accrued through the date such
Benefit Plan is terminated.



Section 5.16 _ WARN Act_. Shareholders acknowledge that the PHP Group
will offer continued employment to only the Designated Employees. Shareholders
will cause Newco Group to either continue the employment of the remaining PHP
Group employees or move such employees to one of the Excluded Subsidiaries or
PHP Group shall terminate some or all of the excluded employees effective on
the Closing Date. Shareholders shall cause the PHP Group to provide before
Closing and in accordance with the WARN Act and all DOL Regulations and
Florida law, any required notices to the PHP Groups employees under the WARN
Act, DOL Regulations and Florida law, including the giving of any notices to
such employees of the Merger. 



Section 5.17 _ Letter of Credit_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, at Closing, but not at any time after Closing,
Agent shall be entitled to have a portion of the Holdback Escrow
Collateral released to his possession for the benefit of one or more
Shareholders, provided that Agent or any such Shareholder shall have provided
Escrow Agent with an irrevocable clean standby letter of credit, in the form
and on terms attached as _Exhibit K [OMITTED]_ , in the aggregate dollar
amount of up to 88% of the Holdback Escrow Collateral requested by Agent to be
released from escrow. Such standby letter of credit shall be from a United
States bank or financial institution of AAA rating and shall serve as
collateral for the indemnification obligations of Shareholders hereunder as a
portion of the Holdback Escrow Collateral as provided in the Escrow Agreement.



Section 5.18 _ Regulatory Reporting_. Shareholders shall either cause
Newco Group to prepare in time to allow for review and timely filing by the
PHP Group all required year-end regulatory reports, acceptable to
such applicable Governmental Entities, and cause the appropriate officer of
the PHP Group as of the time immediately before Closing to sign all management
representation letters for fiscal year ending December 31, 2002 of the PHP
Group with applicable Governmental Entities or, at Buyers option,
Shareholders will provide Buyer with all data necessary for such reports for
the period through the Closing (including programs and related documentation),
within a reasonable period of time before such reports are due to enable
Buyer to prepare and file such reports. In this regard, the data for the
period through the Closing Date will be furnished to Buyer in machine-readable
format within 30 days before the applicable filing deadline. Newco Group
shall assist Buyer, at Buyers cost, in appropriating such data into Buyers
environment. Any filing fees associated with all such filings shall be accrued
on the Closing Balance Sheet. Newco Group and Buyer shall split the cost
for any accounting or audit fees relating to any such regulatory reports.



Section 5.19 _ License of Contract Forms_. The Company will grant to
Newco Group a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce and
create derivative works of the Contract Forms for use by Newco Group in
the State of Florida and solely for the support of the Excluded Business
pursuant to the License Agreement ("License Agreement") in the form attached
as _Exhibit C [OMITTED_ ].

 

60 Section 5.20 _ CarePlus Health Plans Members_. Before the Closing Date,
PHPI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assume from CarePlus Health
Plans, and CarePlus Health Plans shall assign and transfer to PHPI,
that certain agreement dated as of July 1, 2002, by and between AHCA and
CarePlus Health Plans (the "CarePlus Medicaid Contract"). PHPI shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to secure all requisite regulatory approvals
in connection therewith, including without limitation approval of AHCA
pursuant to § 409.912 of the 2001 Florida Statutes, as amended, and approval
of the DOI in accordance with § 628.4615 of the 2001 Florida Statutes, as
amended. PHPI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide all
required notices to the members and contracted providers of CarePlus Health
Plans of the assignment of such CarePlus Medicaid Agreement as required by
applicable law, including without limitation notice to providers of any
changes to the addresses and telephone numbers for claims. PHPI shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to keep intact as of the Closing Date the
membership and provider network (or substantially equivalent) under the
CarePlus Medicaid Contract. PHPI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all Provider Agreements under the CarePlus Medicaid Contract to be
assigned to PHPI from CarePlus Health Plans before the Closing Date, and shall
forward to Buyer any written notices received from any contract provider of
CarePlus Health Plans of such providers intent to terminate its provider
agreement. In connection with the transfer of the CarePlus Medicaid Contract
to PHPI, CarePlus Health Plans and PHPI shall send the required notices of
transfer of the Medicaid Members of the CarePlus Health Plans to PHPI in time
to allow such members to elect to opt out or to become a Medicaid Member of
PHPI before the Closing Date. To the extent Medicaid members under the
CarePlus Medicaid Contract have not transferred their membership to the
Medicaid Business or any opt out period granted such members under Federal and
State law shall not have expired by Closing Date, such members shall not be
included in determining membership under Section 2.3(f). In the event
CarePlus Health Plans shall be unable to assign the CarePlus Medicaid Contract
and the membership and provider network under the CarePlus Medicaid Contract
to PHPI before Closing (or such later date as shall be approved by Buyer, in
its sole discretion, in writing), it shall terminate immediately the CarePlus
Medicaid Contract and cease engaging in the Medicaid Business.



Section 5.21 _ Leases_. Before the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the
right to negotiate with the landlords of the properties listed on _Schedule
2.1(k) [OMITTED_ ] with respect to the termination at or after Closing Date
of any of the PHP Groups leases relating thereto. If Buyer negotiates an
early termination of any such leases, the PHP Group shall pay the landlord the
cost of the termination (the "Buyout Amount") at the Closing,
in consideration of an agreement to terminate the subject lease with the
landlord in a form acceptable to Buyer in its discretion. The Buyout Amount
shall be added to the Aggregate Consideration and the Closing Cash Amount paid
at Closing. The PHP Group will transfer the lease for the office space at
1408 N. Westshore Boulevard, Tampa, Florida to Newco Group before Closing. In
the event the landlord does not consent to the assignment of such lease to
Newco Group, the parties shall fully cooperate to provide the benefit of such
lease to Newco Group and Newco Group shall pay the rent and indemnify and hold
harmless the PHP Group from the tenants obligations under the lease. In the
event the PHP Group derives a Tax benefit from using the Buyout Amount as a
deduction on its Tax returns for the period ending the Closing Date, the
Shareholders shall pay the amount of such Tax benefit as determined under
Section 5.3(o) to the Buyer upon receipt of such amount in cash from
the Internal Revenue Service and the State of Florida.

 

61 Section 5.22 _ Related Agreements_. Before Closing, the Company and
Shareholders covenant and agree that the Group Agreement dated January 1, 2000
between PHPI and HSC Health and Wellness, Inc., which is attached hereto as 
_Exhibit N [OMITTED_ ], shall not be amended or terminated without the prior
written consent of Buyer. Further, before Closing, the Atlantic Dental
Ancillary Care Agreement, which is described in Section 7.2(s) and attached as
_Exhibit S [OMITTED_ ], and the Provider Agreement, which is described in
Section 7.2(t) and attached as _Exhibit O [OMITTED_ ] shall not be amended or
terminated except as required in Sections 7.2(s) and 7.2(t).



Section 5.23 _ Disclosed Matters_. The Company shall utilize
commercially reasonable efforts to settle and resolve the Orlando Regional
Health Systems Claim referenced on _Schedule 3.8 [OMITTED_ ]
("Orlando Claim") and the complaints referenced on _Schedule 3.18(e)
[OMITTED_ ] and _Schedule 3.24 [OMITTED_ ] ("Complaints") prior to the Closing
Date. To the extent that the PHP Group incurs Losses after the Closing Date
with respect to the Orlando Claim or any Complaint (unless it is primarily
related to the Excluded Business, in such case, it will be paid in full by
Newco Group) in excess of $100,000 per Claim or Complaint more than the
reserve for such Claim or Complaint on the Closing Balance Sheet, as adjusted
by Sections 2.3(h) and 2.3(i), then such Loss shall be deemed a Loss from a
breach of any representation and warranty by the Shareholders and subject to
the provisions of Article 6.



Section 5.24 _ Tenet HealthSystems_. Between the date hereof and
Closing, PHPI shall use its commercially reasonable efforts and good faith to
maintain a contractual relationship with Tenet Health Systems of South
Florida (including any of its Affiliates to the extent related to such
matter) ("Tenet") for the Tenet facilities which provide services to the
Members. In the event Tenet pursues its Notice of Termination which is
attached as _Exhibit R [OMITTED_ ], PHPI will use commercially reasonable
efforts to contract with comparable hospitals in each of the markets as the
Tenet facilities, provide services to Members and at rates similar to the
rates the PHP Group currently pays Tenet. With respect to any such
contracting, Buyer shall have the right to participate in negotiating Provider
Agreements with replacement facilities and to approve any such Provider
Agreement. The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not be deemed
to affect any of the representations and warranties of the PHP Group made in
Section 3.12(a).



ARTICLE VI 

 INDEMNIFICATION



Section 6.1 _ Basic Provisions_.



(a) _Indemnification by Shareholders_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article VI, the Company (before Closing) and Shareholders, with
each Shareholder (except GAMM Investments, Ltd. which shall have no liability
or responsibility under this Section 6.1 whatsoever) responsible for a share
of all of Shareholders liability under this Section 6.1 equal to the
percentage of the Shares owned by each Shareholder as provided in _Schedule
3.1 [OMITTED_ ], except that Agent, MBF Holdings I Limited Partnership, MBF
Holdings II Limited Partnership, CMF Investments Limited Partnership, AMF
Investments Limited Partnership,

 

62 MBF Investments Limited Partnership and MBF I Investments Limited Partnership,
jointly and severally, shall be liable for 79.92% of such liability
representing the ownership of Agent and GAMM Investments, Ltd. (on and after
Closing), agree to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer, and the PHP Group, and
their respective successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the
"Buyer Indemnified Parties"), harmless from and in respect of any and all
losses, damages, costs, retrospective rate adjustments by a Payor in lieu of a
claim which would be subject to Sections 6.1(a)(i) or (ii) below, and
reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of
investigation and defense fees and disbursements of counsel and other
professionals) (collectively, "Losses"), that they may incur (i) arising out
of or due to any inaccuracy of any representation or the breach of any
warranty, covenant, undertaking or other agreement of Shareholders or the
Company contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule at and as of
the Effective Time, to the extent that such Losses (x) relate to or arise out
of or are in connection with the assets, businesses, operations, conduct,
products and/or employees (including former employees) of the PHP Group,
Excluded Subsidiaries or Shareholders, relating to or arising out of or in
connection with the operations of the PHP Group or the Business on or before
the Closing Date and (y) do not arise out of a breach of Buyers
representations and warranties in, or a default in the performance of any of
Buyers covenants under, this Agreement, (ii) arising out of or due to any
Excluded Liability or the operation of the Excluded Subsidiaries (with respect
to the Excluded Business, (iii) arising out of or due to the Medicare and
commercial insurance related litigation and claims and those matters
described in _Schedule 6.1(a) [OMITTED_ ], the EEOC, discrimination and other
civil rights claims, and any related litigation hereafter brought by the
Persons listed in _Schedule 6.1(a) [OMITTED_ ], and the guarantees listed as
items 1, 2 and 3 on _Schedule 3.31 [OMITTED_ ], which constitutes part of the
Excluded Liabilities or (iv) arising out of any claims by Dissenting
Shareholders in excess of Dissenters Allocable Consideration; p
_rovided, however_ , neither the Shareholders nor the Newco Group shall have
any obligation to indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties from and Losses arising
out of or in connection with (i) the termination of Designated Employees that
Buyer elects not to have the PHP Group continue to employ after the Closing
Date and (ii) any claims made by employees primarily employed in the Business
by the PHP Group, other than those listed in _Schedule 6.1(a) [OMITTED_ ],
whose employment is terminated at the written request of Buyer (or whose
employment continues until the Closing Date but is not otherwise continued by
the PHP Group after Closing), and whose employment is not continued by the
Newco Group, to the extent such claims are based upon a violation of law
relating to age, sex or race discrimination, disability or other civil rights
("Excluded Termination Claims"), _provided_ that such Losses shall reduce the
then remaining Basket on a dollar-for-dollar basis, provided that
Shareholders shall have no liability to Buyer for Excluded Termination Claims
that exceed the Basket. After Closing, Buyer shall be partially secured
through access to the Holdback Escrow Collateral for the purpose of providing
collateral security from the Losses suffered or incurred pursuant to this
Section 6.1(a). Notwithstanding, anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive recourse for Losses arising
out of or due to any Excluded Liability against Shareholders shall be resort
to the funds deposited and remaining as part of the Escrow Amount or any
letter of credit issued in lieu thereof and Shareholders shall have no
personal liability with respect thereto; _provided, however_ , that the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall have such recourse against Newco Group for Losses
arising out of or due to the Excluded Liabilities in the manner set forth in
the Separation Agreement. Except with respect to indemnification claims which
are made pursuant to Sections 5.3, 6.2 and 5.10(b), Losses related

 

63 to a breach of covenants hereunder or arising out of any claims by Dissenting
Shareholders in excess of Dissenters Allocable Consideration, and payments
pursuant to Sections 2.3(g), 2.3(h) and 2.3(i), and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Shareholders
have any liability for any breach or breaches of representations
and warranties under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in excess of $15 million (the "Liability Cap"). Except for Excluded
Liabilities and the breach of any covenant by Shareholders or the Company, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties right to indemnification under this Section 6.1(a)
shall be satisfied only by resort to the funds deposited and remaining as part
of the Escrow Amount and any letter of credit in lieu thereof, plus any
payment from the Escrow Amount pursuant to Sections 2.3(g), 2.3(h) and
2.3(i), plus $5,000,000, plus any payments from the Escrow Amount for any
Excluded Liability or for the breach of any covenant by Shareholders or the
Company. In this regard, Buyer, in its sole discretion, shall control the
priority of claims against the Escrow Amount (and any letter of credit
delivered in lieu thereof and in accordance with this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement) so that claims under Section 6.1(a) against the Escrow Amount may
take priority over claims for Taxes and other claims against the Escrow
Amount, as Buyer shall determine by written notice to Agent and Escrow Agent;
_provided, however_ , that except with respect to Excluded Liabilities (for
which Buyer shall have the discretion of pursuing (i) the Escrow Amount (or
any letter of credit issued in lieu thereof) or (ii) Newco Group as provided
in the Separation Agreement), to the extent that there are funds deposited and
remaining in the Escrow Amount (or any letter of credit issued in lieu
thereof) and a claim by the Buyer Indemnified Parties is settled or otherwise
finally resolved in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including
without limitation any claim made pursuant to Section 5.3 or 6.2), the Buyer
Indemnified Party must first apply any funds remaining in the Escrow Amount
(or any letter of credit issued in lieu thereof), towards the indemnification
obligations of Shareholders for such resolved or settled claim before
seeking recourse against Shareholders personally.



(b) _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article VI, Buyer and Parent agree to indemnify, defend and hold the
Company (before Closing) and Shareholders (before and after Closing) and their
respective successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Shareholder
Indemnified Parties"), harmless from and in respect of any and all Losses and
retrospective rate adjustments by a Payor in favor of the PHP Group related to
a period before Closing that they may incur (i) arising out of or due to any
inaccuracy of any representation or the breach of any warranty, covenant,
undertaking or other agreement of Buyer or Parent contained in this Agreement,
or (ii) arising out of any and all actions, suits, claims and administrative
or other proceedings of every kind and nature instituted against Shareholders
or any member of the Newco Group at any time after the Closing Date to the
extent that such Losses (x) relate to or arise out of or in connection with
the assets, businesses, operations, conduct, products and/or employees of
Buyer or Parent and (y) do not arise out of a breach of Shareholders
representations and warranties in, or a default in the performance of any
of Shareholders covenants under, this Agreement.



(c) _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Basket_. The
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement or
in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the
Closing for a period of two years except for the representations and
warranties in Section 3.14, which shall survive for the applicable statute of

 

64 limitations, as extended by any actions of Shareholders or their designee, and
the representations and warranties of Section 3.1(e), which shall survive for
the applicable statute of limitations (the "Survival Period"). All claims
under Article V and this Article VI shall toll the Survival Period for such
claim while outstanding. Anything to the contrary contained
herein notwithstanding, except with respect to claims under Sections 5.3,
5.10(b) or 6.2, Losses related to a breach of covenants hereunder, any
Positive or Negative True Up Amount under Section 2.3(h), Non-Medical Claims
Positive or Negative True Up Amount under Section 2.3(i) and any Aggregate
Consideration adjustments under Section 2.3(g), any claims by Dissenting
Shareholders in excess of Dissenters Allocable Consideration, and for
obligations and Excluded Liabilities assumed by Newco Group pursuant to the
Separation Agreement for which there is no "Basket", a party shall not be
entitled to any recovery from the other unless and until the aggregate amount
of all claims for Losses for the breach or breaches of representations and
warranties of such party exceeds an amount (the "Basket") equal to Seven
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000), less any Claims charged against the
Pre-Closing Basket, not to exceed Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000). In the event that the Losses exceed the Basket, then the
indemnified party shall be entitled to indemnification only for such Losses in
excess of the Basket.



(d) _Notice and Opportunity to Defend_. If an event occurs which a party
asserts would give rise to any indemnification obligation pursuant to Section
6.1 the party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnitee") shall promptly give
written notice thereof to the other party obligated to provide indemnification
(the "Indemnifying Party"). If such event involves (i) any claim or (ii) the
commencement of any action or proceeding by a third Person (including without
limitation any claim by a Provider) (collectively, the "Asserted Liability"),
the Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party prompt written notice of
such claim or the commencement of such action or proceeding describing the
Asserted Liability in reasonable detail and indicating the amount (estimated,
if necessary) for which such party may be liable; _provided, however_ , that
the failure to provide prompt written notice as provided herein will relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder only to the extent that
such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder. If any
such action is brought against the Indemnitee and it notifies the
Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall,
upon providing prompt written notification thereof within 10 days of receipt
of any notice to the Indemnitee, be entitled to participate therein and, to
the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnitee of such election to so assume the defense thereof,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof and the Indemnitee agrees
to cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense
against any such Asserted Liability. The Indemnitee shall have the right to
participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such Asserted Liability
provided that the Indemnifying Party in all instances shall be responsible
for directing and controlling the settlement of, or defense against, such
action. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to undertake to settle or defend
against the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its
election as herein provided, or does not accept its obligation to indemnify
under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may settle, compromise or defend such
Asserted Liability in the exercise of its exclusive discretion at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party and the

 

65 Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee for the amount of
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection
with the settlement of or defense against the Asserted Liability to the extent
provided in Section 6.1(a) or (b), as the case may be, including its selection
of counsel. If no settlement of the Asserted Liability is entered into,
the Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee for the amount
of any judgment rendered with respect to such Asserted Liability and all
related, bona fide and reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in
defense against such action to the extent recoverable under Section 6.1(a) or
(b) as the case may be. Except as specified herein, in no event shall an
Indemnifying Party be liable for any settlement effected without its consent,
which will not be unreasonably withheld. 



(e) _Limitations on Indemnification_. To the extent that Buyer or
PHP Group is entitled to receive payment under any insurance policies or from
any other source on account of claims arising under this Article VI,
including, without limitation, any litigation and claims described on
_Schedule 6.1(a) [OMITTED]_ , the amount (if any) payable by Shareholders on
account of such claims shall be reduced by the amount of such payment, and
such amounts shall not be deemed to be Losses hereunder or, if Buyer or the
PHP Group shall have already collected on such claim from Shareholders, then
Buyer shall repay to Shareholders the amount of such payment, and such amounts
shall not be deemed to be Losses hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) except as provided in the
Separation Agreement, the rights and remedies under this Article VI shall be
the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of the parties on account of any
claims arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or any
transactions contemplated hereby; (b) no special, incidental, punitive or
consequential damages shall be imposed on any party in connection with any
indemnification of any or all Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article VI;
and (c) all indemnification payments under this Article VI shall be deemed to
be adjustments to the Aggregate Consideration. Except for Taxes which are
covered by Section 5.3, the amount of Losses payable by an Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnitee shall be determined on an after-tax basis. For example, if
a payment of a Loss would constitute income to an Indemnitee, the amount of
the payment to the Indemnitee shall be grossed-up or increased so that, after
any income Tax on the payment, the payment would equal the amount of the
Loss. In determining any Tax benefit to an Indemnitee, the Tax effect of the
Loss shall be determined only by reference to the Tax year in which the Loss
is properly taken into account for Tax purposes. For example, if a Loss of
an Indemnitee is deductible and the amount of the deduction increases a net
operating loss of an Indemnitee which existed before such deduction, and such
net operating loss can only be carried forward to future Tax years of the
Indemnitee, the Tax benefit from the deductibility of the Loss shall
considered to be zero even though the Indemnitee may realize Tax benefits from
the absorption of the net operating loss carryovers in future Tax years.



(f) _Other Matters_. Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnitee
shall, in the defense of any Asserted Liability, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement agreement, except with the written
consent of the other party, which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to both the Indemnitee
and the Indemnifying Party of a release from all liability in respect of such
Asserted Liability. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee shall each use
all commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other
in connection with the settlement of, or the defense against, any

 

66 Asserted Liability and make available to the other all books, records and
other documents within its control that are reasonably necessary
or appropriate for such defense. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement, the Indemnitee shall have the right to pay or settle at any time
any Asserted Liability, provided that (as a result thereof, and except where
the Indemnifying Party elects not to undertake to settle or defend against
the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election, or
does not accept its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement) the
Indemnitee shall also be deemed to have waived any right to indemnification
therefor by the Indemnifying Party.



Section 6.2 _ Tax Indemnification_. Except as set forth in the last
sentence of Section 6.1(a), all claims relating to Taxes shall be governed by
Section 5.3. The Parties agree that Newco Group shall have liability for any
Spin Off Tax Liability but that any such liability is also covered by Section
5.3.



ARTICLE VII 

 CONDITIONS



Section 7.1 _ Conditions to Each Partys Obligation to Effect the
Closing_. The obligations of Shareholders, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, to consummate the Closing are subject to the satisfaction (or, if
permissible, waiver by the party for whose benefit such conditions exist) of
the following conditions:



(a) no court, arbitrator or Governmental Entity shall have issued any
order, decree or ruling, or taken any other action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final, and non-appealable;

Section 7.2 _ Conditions to the Obligations of Buyer_. The obligations
of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver in whole or in part by Buyer) of the
following further conditions:



(a) Each of the representations and warranties of the Company
and Shareholders shall be true and accurate in all material respects as of
the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as if made at and as of such time
(other than those representations and warranties that address matters only as
of a particular date or only with respect to a specific period of time which
need to be true and accurate only as of such date or with respect to such
period), and giving effect to all limitations as to "materiality" and
"Material Adverse Effect" set forth in such representations and warranties,
_provided, however_ , the parties shall be obligated to consummate

 

67 the transactions contemplated hereby if, in the event the representations and
warranties of the Company and Shareholders are not true as of the Closing

liability in the Closing Balance Sheet and such breach would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Business or the PHP Group, taken as a whole,

the Loss caused by such disclosed items is equal to or less than $500,000
(the "Pre-Closing Basket") in the aggregate from all such disclosed items,
Buyer shall be obligated to close and to accept such Losses provided that the
first $250,000 of such Losses shall reduce the amount of Basket set forth in

corporation ("Buyer"), AMERIGROUP Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), and certain preferred and common shareholders of the Company
listed on the signature pages hereto.

 



_RECITALS_



WHEREAS, Company, Buyer, Parent and certain of the Shareholders entered into
that certain Merger Agreement dated August 21, 2002 and certain side letters
executed by the parties on August 21, 2002 (the "Agreement"); and



WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to amend such Merger Agreement, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Amendment.



_AGREEMENT_



In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows: 



1. _Capitalized Terms_. Each capitalized term used in this Amendment and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Agreement. 



2. _Certain Definitions_. The definitions of (i) "Redemption" shall be deleted in its entirety; (ii) "Agreement", "Closing Book Value", "Escrow Agent" and "Spin Off Transaction" contained in Section 1.1 of the Agreement shall be deleted in their entirety and replaced with the following; (iii) "Shareholder Distribution" shall be deleted in its entirety; and (iv) "Preferred Consideration," "Non-Signing Shareholder" and "Shareholder Receivables" shall be added to Section 1.1 of the Agreement as follows: 



"Agreement" has the meaning set forth in the preface, as the same may be
amended from time to time.



"Closing Book Value" means (A) the PHP Groups net book value of all of the
Assets minus the Assumed Liabilities required to be disclosed on a balance
sheet in accordance with GAAP, as of the Closing Date (whether or not
positive), as determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP
(specifically including unpaid Taxes, if any, attributable to the period on
and before the Closing Date) _minus_ (B) Taxes receivable, goodwill and other
intangible assets (other than Receivables, marketable investment securities,
deferred tax assets calculated as set forth below, and other current assets
reflected on the PHP



 

Groups statutory financial statements) and any nonadmitted asset (determined
in accordance with Florida law) other than equipment and furniture purchased
or 

 

1 leased by the PHP Group after June 30, 2001 and described in Section
5.1(h)(ii) and _Schedule 1.1_ [OMITTED] and, in the case of any equipment and
furniture purchased or leased after the date hereof, subject to the
limitations of such Section 5.1(h)(ii), the net book value of which shall be
included in Closing Book Value, and other than deferred tax assets calculated
as set forth below, which shall also be included in determining Closing Book
Value, appearing on the PHP Groups books and included in Assets under clause
(A) above. Closing Book Value shall be determined at the end of the
Closing Date and after the Spin Off Transaction and distribution of
Shareholder Receivables and all other transactions occurring at, on, or before
Closing. Each of the cash, cash equivalents, stocks, bonds and securities to
be included in Assets and reflected on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet
shall be shown at no more than the fair market value of such Assets on the
Closing Date. Deferred tax assets included in Assets under clause (A) above
shall be limited to what would be admitted deferred tax assets calculated in
accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable in Florida with
respect to HMOs but without applying the 10 percent of statutory capital and
surplus limit but shall only include deferred tax assets relating to accrued
expenses expected to be realized within one year and prepaid income.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Shareholder
Receivables shall not be included in determining Closing Book Value, but shall
be distributed to Shareholders by the Company in the Merger in accordance
with the provisions of Section 7 hereof.



"Escrow Agent" means Union Planters Bank or any other financial institution as
may be mutually acceptable to the parties to the Agreement.



"Non-Signing Shareholders" means any Shareholder (other than a holder of
Dissenting Shares) who does not execute the Agreement and this Amendment
either directly or pursuant to a power of attorney. To the extent any such
Shareholder subsequently executes the Agreement and this Amendment either
directly or pursuant to a power of attorney, then such Person shall not be
deemed a Non-Signing Shareholder. 



"Preferred Consideration" means, for each Preferred Share, the sum of $100,
plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on such Preferred Share up to the
Closing Date.



"Shareholder Receivables" means (i) up to $29.2 million in (A) promissory
notes from certain Shareholders issued to and held by the Company in
connection with the Spin Off Transaction which are due and payable on or
before the Closing Date, and (B) cash delivered to the Company by any
such Shareholder on or prior to the Closing Date in connection with the Spin
Off Transaction, (ii) notes from Shareholders in the principal face amount of
$2,950,000 plus interest accrued thereon to the extent due to the Company on

Newco Group to certain of the Shareholders pursuant to Subscriptions (defined
below) and the distribution to Shareholders of the Shareholder Receivables.



 

3. _Cash, Investments_. Section 2.1(d) of the Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

the Shareholders in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and this
Amendment, shall be sufficient (i) to attain statutory net worth, including,
without limitation, deposits required of the PHP Group by the State of
Florida or otherwise required by Florida statute and regulation or the
Medicaid Contract, the Summit Contract or the FHK Contracts to be owned by the
PHP Group, and (ii) to attain a Closing Book Value of the Required Net Worth.
Such cash (including, without limitation, any additional capital
contributions equal to any Deficit required to be made by Buyer in accordance
with the provisions hereof) cash equivalents and other short-term investments
in the Company and PHPI shall equal or exceed the accrued expenses, payables
and other current liabilities as reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet (all
without duplication);"



4. _Tangible Personal Property_. Section 2.1(e) of the Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 



"(e) _Tangible Personal Property_. The equipment, office materials and
supplies, tools, vehicles, software, computers, fixtures, leasehold
improvements, and furniture (and other tangible personal property) primarily
used in the conduct of the Business including, without limitation, that listed
in _Schedule 2.1(e)_ attached (the "Tangible Personal Property"); provided,
that the Computer Science Corporation computer system and the Echo computer

5. _Assumed Liabilities_. The following sentence shall be added to the end of Section 2.2(a) of the Agreement: 



"Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement to the contrary,
pursuant to the next to the last sentence of Section 2.2(a) of the Agreement,

3 6.1(a)(iii) to the extent that they are not reserved for on the Closing
Balance Sheet or provided for in the true ups pursuant to Sections 2.3(h) and
2.3(i)."



6. _Aggregate Consideration_. Section 2.3(b) of the Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 



"(b) _Aggregate Consideration_. The aggregate consideration payable to the
holders of the Shares and the Preferred Shares shall be equal to the sum of:
(i) Ninety-Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($99,500,000), subject
to the adjustments provided in Sections 2.3(e) and 5.15(a), if applicable (the
"Closing Cash Amount"); (ii) Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) (the

in Sections 5.3(c), 6.1, and 6.2 of the Agreement or as such may be increased
from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Agreement
(the "Aggregate Consideration"). The Aggregate Consideration shall be paid
according to the terms and conditions hereof.



7. _Consummation and Effect of Merger_. Section 2.3(c) of the Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

State of Florida (the "Department of State"), in such form as Buyer and Agent
reasonably determine is required by, and is in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the Corporation Code. The Merger shall become effective at the

Corporation Code. The Company may, at any time after the Statutory Effective
Time, take any action (including executing and delivering any document) in the

any of the parties to the Agreement, the following actions will occur:



     |

(i)

---|---|---|--- 



 

4 (ii)

 |



 |

each issued and outstanding Preferred Share immediately prior to the Statutory
Effective Time (except for certificates representing Dissenting Shares)
shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist and shall be converted
into the right to receive, in cash (out of the Closing Cash Amount), an amount
equal to $100, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on each Preferred Share
up to the Closing Date, in the amounts set forth in _Schedule 3.4_ [OMITTED]; 

---|---|---|--- 



     |

(iii)

 |



 |

subject to the provisions of Article IX, each issued and outstanding Share
immediately prior to the Statutory Effective Time (except for

---|---|---|--- 



     |

(1)

 |



 |

an amount equal to the (i) the difference between the Closing Cash Amount and
the Preferred Consideration for all Preferred Shares, divided by (ii) the
number of Shares outstanding on the Closing Date (the "Allocated Closing Cash
Amount"); 

---|---|---|--- 



     |

(2)

 |



 |

an amount equal to the Escrow Amount divided by the number of Shares
outstanding on the Closing Date (the "Allocated Escrow Amount");

  
---|---|---|--- 



     |

(3)

 |



 |

an amount equal to a portion of the Membership Cash Consideration, if any,
calculated by dividing the amount of the Membership Cash Consideration by the
number of Shares outstanding on the Closing Date (the "Allocated Membership
Cash Consideration"); 

---|---|---|--- 



     |

(4)

 |



 |

 _plus_ an amount equal to a portion of the Excess calculated by dividing the
amount of the Excess, if any, by the number of Shares outstanding on

portion of the Deficit, if any, calculated by dividing the Deficit by the
number of Shares outstanding on the Closing Date (the "Allocated Deficit");  

---|---|---|--- 



     |

(5)

 |



 |

 _plus_ an amount equal to a portion of the Positive True Up Amount, if any,
calculated by dividing the Positive True Up Amount by the number of
Shares outstanding on the Closing Date (the "Allocated Positive True Up
Amount") or _minus_ an amount equal to a portion of the Negative True Up
Amount, if any, calculated by dividing the Negative True Up Amount by the
number of Shares outstanding on the Closing Date (the "Allocated Negative
True Up Amount"), as applicable; 

---|---|---|--- 



     |

(6)

 |



 |

 _plus_ an amount equal to a portion of the Non-Medical Claims Positive True
Up Amount, if any, calculated by dividing the Non-Medical Claims Positive
True Up Amount by the number of Shares outstanding on the Closing Date (the
"Allocated Positive Non-Medical True Up Amount") or 

---|---|---|--- 
 

5 _minus_ an amount equal to a portion of the Non-Medical Claims Negative True
Up Amount, if any, calculated by dividing the Non-Medical Claims Negative
True Up Amount by the number of Shares outstanding on the Closing Date (the
"Allocated Negative Non-Medical True Up Amount"), as applicable;



 

in each case rounded to the nearest whole cent and as such shall be reduced
from time to time in accordance with the indemnification provisions set forth
in Sections 5.3(c), 6.1, and 6.2 of the Agreement or as such may be increased
from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Agreement
(the "Merger Consideration");



     |

(iv)

 |



 |

simultaneously and in connection with the Merger, the Shareholder Receivables
shall be assigned by the Company to the Agent without recourse on behalf of
the Shareholders and each issued and outstanding Share shall also convert
into the right to receive from the payors of the Shareholder Receivables an
amount equal to the Shareholder Receivables divided by the number of issued
and outstanding Shares; and  

---|---|---|--- 



     |

(v)

 |



 |

each share of the Companys capital stock held in the treasury of the Company
or by a subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Statutory Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, be canceled and cease to exist and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto." 

---|---|---|--- 



8. _Dissenting Shares; Waiver of Dissenter s Rights_. Section 2.3(d) of the Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 



"(d) _Dissenting Shares; Waiver of Dissenter s Rights_ _._ Notwithstanding
any other provision of the Agreement to the contrary, Shares and Preferred
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Statutory
Effective Time and which are (i) held by shareholders who shall have not
voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing, and (ii) who
shall have delivered a written notice of intent to demand payment for such
Shares or Preferred Shares in accordance with Section 607.1320(3) of the
Corporation Code and otherwise perfected their rights under Section 607.1320
of the Corporation Code (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive any portion of the Aggregate
Consideration and shall be deemed cancelled. Such shareholders (the
"Dissenting Shareholders") shall be entitled to only receive payment of the
value of such Shares and/or Preferred Shares held by them in accordance with
the provisions of the Corporation Code, except that all Dissenting Shares
held by shareholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Shares and/or
Preferred Shares pursuant to relevant provisions of the Corporation Code,
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable, as of the Statutory Effective Time, for the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, such shareholders allocated

 

6 share of the Aggregate Consideration. The Company shall comply with Section
607 of the Corporation Code. The Agent shall hold such portion of the
Aggregate Consideration that would have been allocable to the Dissenting
Shareholders if such shareholders had not dissented as provided above
("Dissenters Allocable Consideration") until such time as the final,
unappealable amount of payment is determined for the Dissenting Shareholders
shares under the Corporation Code, at which time Agent shall distribute such
Dissenters Allocable Consideration in accordance with the Corporation Code.
Each of the Shareholders and holders of Preferred Shares who execute the
Agreement or the Amendment hereby waives his, her or its dissenters rights
under the Corporation Code with respect to the Merger to the extent permitted
by law, and agrees to execute to the extent permitted by law, prior to Closing
such documents or instruments as may be reasonably requested by the Company or
the Buyer to evidence or further effect such waiver."



9. The last sentence of Section 2.3(e) shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following two sentences: 



"If the Shareholders Adjustment Certificate shows a Closing Book Value of
more than the Required Net Worth, then the Closing Cash Amount to be delivered
at Closing shall be increased by the excess of the Closing Book Value over the
Required Net Worth (the "Excess"); provided, however, that to the extent that
the Company has in excess of $2,400,000 of cash (the "$2,400,000 Threshold")
on the Closing Date and the Shareholders Adjustment Certificate shows an
Excess payment is due, then the Excess shall first be paid in cash by the
Company to the Shareholders in an amount equal to the cash in the Company in
excess of the $2,400,000 Threshold (in no event to exceed the amount of the
Excess) and any remaining balance of the Excess shall be paid by Buyer. The
Shareholders shall have no liability under this Agreement in the event that
the distribution of Excess Cash by Company to Shareholders under Section
2.3(c)(iv) of the Agreement shall cause a regulatory issue for PHPI; provided,
however, that if Buyer funds a Deficit under Section 2.1(d) or the other
provisions of this Agreement, such Deficit shall reduce Merger Consideration."
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet or Closing Balance Sheet is prepared as of
the end of the Closing Date and any portion of the Excess paid by the Company
is not reflected in either Balance Sheet at such time, in calculating the
Excess, Actual Excess or Actual Deficit from such Balance Sheet pursuant to
this Section 2.3(e) or Section 2.3(g) of the Agreement, any portion of the
Excess paid by Company pursuant to this Section 2.3(e) shall be added to the
amount otherwise determined to be the Closing Book Value under this Section
2.3(e) or Section 2.3(g) of the Agreement, as the case may be; it being
understood that the intention of this provision is that the Shareholders do
not receive more or less consideration by virtue of the fact that a portion of
the Excess is being paid by Company instead of Buyer.



10. _No Further Ownership Rights in Stock_. Section 2.3(k) of the Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: 

 

7 "(k) _No Further Ownership Rights in Stock_. The consideration paid
to the Shareholders and the holders of the Preferred Shares shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company capital stock, and from and after the Statutory Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of Company of the shares of Company capital stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Statutory Effective Time. If, after the Statutory
Effective Time, certificates are presented to Company or the Agent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and each Shareholder and holder of Preferred
Shares shall receive his, her or its allocated share of the Aggregate
Consideration.



11. _Closing_. Sections 2.4(b) and (c) of the Agreement shall be deleted in their entirety and replaced with the following: 



"(b) At the Closing, Agent shall, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, deliver or cause to be delivered to
Buyer: (i) all stock certificates representing the Shares and the Preferred
Shares; (ii) all other documents and certificates required under Article VII
of this Agreement to be delivered by Shareholders, the Company or Newco Group
to Buyer on or before the Closing Date in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iii) such consents required under other Contracts to
the change of control of the PHP Group, including landlord estoppels, as the
Company is able to obtain using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain same
with the assistance of Buyer. Obtaining the consents and landlord estoppels
referenced in Section 2.4(b)(iii) is not a condition to Closing nor shall it
give rise to any liability on the part of Shareholders or the Company
whatsoever. No interest will be paid or accrued on any sums payable to holders
of certificates. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.4(b), each stock certificate evidencing the Shares and the Preferred
Shares (other than certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Aggregate
Consideration provided for by this Agreement, without interest. Other than the
payment to Agent as provided in Section 2.4(c) below, Buyer shall have no
liability or obligation whatsoever with respect to the payment to holders of
the Shares and Preferred Shares for any such holders allocated share of the
Aggregate Consideration."



"(c) At Closing, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article VII, (i) the Buyer shall: (A) deliver and pay cash to Agent for the
benefit of Shareholders and the holders of Preferred Shares the sum of the
Closing Cash Amount, the Membership Cash Consideration plus the portion of the
Excess over the amount which the Company pays pursuant to Section 2.3(e) or
minus the Deficit, as the case may be; (B) deliver to the Escrow Agent cash
in an amount equal to the Escrow Amount, which shall secure the payment of
Shareholders indemnification obligations hereunder and which shall be held in
escrow and disbursed in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; (C)
make a cash contribution in the form of debt or equity (as determined by
Buyer) to PHPI in the amount of the Deficit, if any, so that based upon the
Shareholders Adjustment Certificate, the PHP Group would upon Closing have
the Required Net Worth, provided, however that any such contribution shall
constitute a Deficit, which

 

8 shall decrease the Aggregate Consideration in accordance with the terms of
the Agreement; and (D) deliver all other documents and certificates required
under Article VII and Closing Cash Amount of the Agreement to be delivered by
Buyer or Parent to Shareholders or the holders of Preferred Shares at or
before the Closing Date in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (ii) the Company shall pay a portion of the Excess as provided in
Section 2.3 (e) and shall endorse all notes and other documents evidencing the
Shareholder Receivables without recourse and deliver and assign to the Agent
for the benefit of the Shareholders the Shareholder Receivables."



12. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholders_. Section 3.4 of the Agreement shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following and a new Section 3.38 of the Agreement shall be added as follows:

There are 997,121.5 shares of common stock, 116,278.5 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock and options to purchase 953,187 shares of common stock issued
and outstanding. The Shares and the Preferred Shares, along with any

of capital stock of the Company at the Closing Date. All the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and are owned by the
Shareholders, the holders of Preferred Shares and any Dissenting
Shareholders. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.4_ [OMITTED], there are no
existing (i) options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other rights,
convertible securities, agreements or commitments of any character obligating
Shareholders, holders of Preferred Shares or the Company to issue, purchase,
transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity interests in the
Company or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or
equity interests; (ii) contractual obligations of Shareholders or the Company
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock of the Company;

Agreement, free and clear of any restrictions on transfer, Taxes, Security
Interests, options, warrants, purchase rights, contracts, commitments,
equities, claims, and demands. No holder of Preferred Shares is a party to any
option, warrant, purchase right, or other contract or commitment that could
require any holder of Preferred Shares to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose
of any capital stock of the Company (other than this Agreement). Except as
set forth on _Schedule 3.4_ [OMITTED], no

 

9 holder of Preferred Shares is a party to any voting trust, proxy, or
other agreement or understanding with respect to the voting of any capital
stock of the Company. The holders of Preferred Shares are conveying all right,
title and interest in and to their Preferred Shares to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement. The Redemption Price (as such term is defined in the Companys
Articles of Incorporation) for the issued and outstanding Preferred Shares as
of December 31, 2002 is $20,465,016, which includes the accrued and unpaid
dividends on each Preferred Shareholders Preferred Shares. The Redemption
Price for each Preferred Shareholders Preferred Shares is set forth on
_Schedule 3.4_ [OMITTED].



(c) This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of
each holder of Preferred Shares, enforceable in accordance with its terms and
conditions except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally; and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.



(d) Neither the execution and the delivery of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, will
violate any constitution, statute, regulation, rule, injunction, judgment,
order, decree, ruling, charge, or other restriction of any government,
governmental agency, or court to which any holder of Preferred Shares is
subject.

any such subsidiary, whether or not in existence as of the date of this
Agreement, directly or indirectly in connection with the Spin Off Transaction,
including but not limited to the sale of securities of CarePlus Holdings,
LLLP and CPHP Holdings, Inc. by the Company, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and such securities,
when so issued, sold and delivered against payment therefor will be duly and
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Furthermore, all such securities
have been offered, issued and sold by the Company or a subsidiary of the
Company, or any affiliate of the Company, in compliance with applicable
federal and state securities laws.



(b) The Subscriptions and other documents used in connection with the
issuance, sale and delivery of any securities in connection with the Spin Off
Transaction did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

_provided, however_ , that in no event shall the amount exceed the Aggregate
Consideration actually received by such Shareholder (which shall not include
Shareholder Receivables). Miguel B. Fernandez personally guarantees the
payment to Buyer Indemnified Parties of the indemnity obligations of
each Shareholder (subject to any and all limitations provided under the
Agreement) under Sections 5.3(c) and 6.2 of the Agreement, which guarantee
shall be construed to include the percentage of the total Shares owned by the
Non-Signing Shareholders, whether or not the Non-Signing Shareholders are

(b) The parties agree: (i) that _Exhibit A_ attached to this Amendment

the Agreement (which for purposes hereof shall exclude any claims which may be
brought under Sections 5.3 or 6.2 of the Agreement) and subject to any and
all limitations provided under the Agreement, if it is finally determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction that the Non-Signing Shareholders are not
liable for their pro rata share of such indemnification obligations because
they are not bound by the Agreement under the Corporation Code or otherwise
(such pro rata portion of such indemnification obligations referred to as the
"Non-Signing Deficiency"), then all Shareholders (other than the Non-Signing
Shareholders) shall be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for their pro rata share (which shall be adjusted upward to take into account
the fact the Non-Signing Shareholders would not be contributing) of the Non-
Signing Deficiency.

overtime compensation and the related employment Taxes and

 

17 benefits at or before Closing, and the cost of such overtime pay and related
employment taxes and benefits which the parties agree and acknowledge is
$8,561, shall be added to the Aggregate Consideration and the Closing Cash
Amount so that the Buyer is effectively responsible for any overtime pay
resulting from overtime hours in excess of 80 hours spent by the Designated
Employees in the Buyer training sessions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Parent and Buyer agree not to disrupt, interfere with or adversely affect the
Business or the Excluded Business in connection with such training.



(g) The parties also acknowledge that certain books and records related
primarily to the Excluded Business are currently held in storage by PHPI.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Agreement or the
Separation Agreement, Buyer hereby agrees to allow Newco Group to continue to
utilize such storage after the Closing for records related to the
commercial insurance line of business and the Pinellas County Indigent
Program; provided, however, that such arrangement shall terminate upon a sale
of: (i) more than 51% of the outstanding shares of the voting common stock of
CPHP Holdings, Inc. or CarePlus Health Plans to nonaffiliates; or (ii) all or
substantially all of the assets of CPHP Holdings, Inc., or CarePlus Health
Plans to nonaffiliates. PHPI shall have no liability with respect to such
record storage except as a bailee under Florida law and the Newco Group shall
indemnify and hold harmless PHPI from any liability related to the storage of
such books and records except to the extent PHPI does not fulfill its
obligations as a bailee under Florida law. Buyer shall bill the Newco
Group on a monthly basis and Newco Group shall promptly pay such invoices for
any expenses related to the storage of such records. Buyer and PHPI shall
afford to the Newco Group reasonable access upon reasonable notice and during
normal business hours to such books and records throughout the period that
PHPI is holding such books and records in storage. Any such books and records
or other information stored by PHPI in accordance with this subsection shall
be kept confidential by the parties, unless and only to the extent that
disclosure is required by PHPI pursuant to law, legal process or regulatory
authority.



(h) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement or GAAP to the contrary,
for purposes of determining the Closing Book Value from the Preliminary
Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Balance Sheet, $1,000,000 shall be added to
Medical Claims liabilities (determined in accordance with GAAP) for excess
margins to be added to IBNR claims and shall be carried through and remain in
the true-ups for the periods required by Sections 2.3(h) and 2.3(i) of the
Agreement. 



(i) The Closing Date will be December 31, 2002, unless otherwise agreed to
in writing by the parties. 



(j) As part of the Spin Off Transaction, PHPI shall transfer to CarePlus
Health Plans sufficient cash, cash equivalents and other short-term
investments so that CarePlus Health Plans shall be in regulatory compliance as
a licensed Medicare HMO on the Closing Date; provided, however, that PHPI
shall retain sufficient cash, cash equivalents and other short-term
investments to comply with the provisions of Section 2.1(d) of the Agreement,
as amended by this Amendment. The Companys cash, cash equivalents and other
short-term investments shall not be used to fund CarePlus Health Plans unless
the liquid assets of PHPI are insufficient

 

18 to meet the requirements of the prior sentence.



(k) On the Closing Date, immediately after payment of the Aggregate
Consideration, PHPI may, in its discretion, pay a dividend to the Company
and/or pay off the outstanding subordinated promissory surplus notes payable
to the Company in any amount by which the Closing Book Value exceeds Required
Net Worth and the requirements of Section 3(d)(i) and (ii).



27. _No Other Modifications_. Except as expressly amended or modified by the terms hereof or otherwise agreed to by the party against whom enforcement of such amendment or modification is sought, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 



28. _Counterparts_. This Amendment may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall together be considered one and the same agreement. 



29. _Signatures_. Any Shareholder or holder of Preferred Shares who executes this Amendment shall be fully bound by the Agreement (in both capacities, as applicable), whether or not executed by such Person. Agent is executing this Amendment and other closing documents on behalf of various Shareholders as Agent under the Agreement and/or pursuant to powers of attorney granted Agent by various Shareholders, none of the Shareholders for whom Agent is signing have revoked the agency and power of attorney granted Agent and none of them are incompetent or deceased, all to the Agents knowledge. 



[SIGNATURES APPEAR ON FOLLOWING PAGE] 

 

19 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to
Merger Agreement to be executed and delivered as of the date first written
above.
