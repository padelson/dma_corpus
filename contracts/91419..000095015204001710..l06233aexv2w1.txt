Agreement;

      WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

      WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger

      WHEREAS, simultaneously with execution of this Agreement, certain
shareholders of Parent named therein have entered into that certain Parent

                                   ARTICLE II

          EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT
               CORPORATIONS; SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT

      Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

      (a) Merger Sub's Common Stock. Each share of Merger Sub's common stock,
par value $0.01 per share ("MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK"), outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding as one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, which shall
constitute the only issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time.

      (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Owned Stock. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned by Parent or any direct or indirect subsidiary of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time and any Company Common Stock held
in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no
consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

      (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2(e), each
issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 2.4) that are owned by Dissenting Shareholders (as defined in Section
2.4) that have properly exercised appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL) will automatically be converted into the right to receive from Parent
(i) a number of fully paid, nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (the "STOCK CONSIDERATION") and (ii) $5 in
cash without interest from Parent, subject to adjustment as set forth in Section
2.1(d) (the "CASH CONSIDERATION" and, together with the Stock Consideration, the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION"), prorated for fractional shares, if any, of Company
Common Stock. The "EXCHANGE RATIO" shall be equal to the quotient (rounded to
four decimal places) of $20 divided by the Average Closing Price (as defined
below) of Parent Common Stock; provided, however, that if, based on the Exchange
Ratio, Parent would be required to issue pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) greater
than 19.9% of the Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such
issuance, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted such that the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) shall not exceed
19.9% of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance.
Computations to be rounded to four decimal places shall be rounded to the next
highest ten thousandth if the computation initially shall be exactly halfway
between the next lowest and next highest ten thousandth. All Company

                                       3
<PAGE>

Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common
Stock ("COMPANY CERTIFICATE") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Common Stock, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be issued in consideration therefor and any dividends or other
distributions to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled in
accordance with this Article II upon the surrender of such Company Certificate.
"AVERAGE CLOSING PRICE" means the average of the per share closing prices of
Parent Common Stock as reported in The Wall Street Journal's New York Stock
Exchange Composite Transactions Reports for each of the 20 consecutive Trading
Days (as defined below) in the period ending with the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date. "TRADING DAY" means a day on which the New York
Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") is open for trading and on which the Parent Common
Stock was traded.

      (d) Cash Consideration Adjustment. In the event the Exchange Ratio is
adjusted pursuant to the proviso contained in the second sentence of Section
2.1(c), the Cash Consideration will be adjusted upward by an amount equal to the
difference between (a) $25 minus (b) the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio as
adjusted pursuant to such proviso multiplied by the Average Closing Price plus
(ii) $5.

      Section 2.2.Exchange of Certificates.

      (a) Exchange Agent. Computershare Institutional Services, LLC will act as
agent of Parent for purposes of, among other things, mailing and receiving
transmittal letters and distributing cash and certificates for Parent Common
Stock, and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, to the
Company shareholders (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"). As of the Effective Time, Parent
and the Exchange Agent shall enter into an agreement which will provide that
Parent shall irrevocably (except as provided in Section 2.2(f)) deposit with the
Exchange Agent as of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II,
through the Exchange Agent, all cash and certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock (such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto with a record date on or
after the Effective Time, and any cash proceeds thereof being hereinafter
referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND") payable or issuable pursuant to Section 2.1
(assuming that all Dissenting Shares will lose the right of appraisal) and
Section 2.2(e) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.
Additional amounts of cash, if any, needed from time to time by the Exchange
Agent to make payments of Cash Consideration or for fractional shares or
Dissenting Shares shall be provided by Parent and shall become part of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund may not be used for any other purpose, except
as provided in this Agreement, or as otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent
before the Effective Time. All cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be
invested in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances of commercial banks
with capital, surplus and undivided profits exceeding $100,000,000 ("PERMITTED
INVESTMENTS") or in money market funds that are invested solely in such
Permitted Investments; provided, that the maturities of Permitted

                                       4

<PAGE>

Investments shall be such as to permit the Exchange Agent to make prompt
payments to persons entitled thereto pursuant to this Section 2.2.

      (b) Exchange Procedures.

                  (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
            Time, the Exchange Agent will mail to each holder of record of a
            Company Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were
            converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration (A) a
            letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be
            effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates
            will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Certificates to
            the Exchange Agent and will be in such form and have such other
            provisions as Parent and the Company may specify consistent with
            this Agreement) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
            surrender of the Company Certificates in exchange for the Merger
            Consideration.

                  (ii) After the Effective Time, and upon surrender in
            accordance with Section 2.2(b)(i) of a Company Certificate for
            cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
            transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
            reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
            Company Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
            the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
            therefor pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, certain
            dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with Section
            2.2(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
            Stock in accordance with Section 2.2(e), and the Company Certificate
            so surrendered will forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
            transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
            registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be
            issued to a person other than the person in whose name the
            Certificate so surrendered is registered (the "TRANSFEREE") if such
            Company Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form
            for transfer and the Transferee pays any transfer or other taxes
            required by reason of such payment to a person other than the
            registered holder of such Company Certificate or establishes to the
            satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is
            not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
            2.2, each Company Certificate converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
            will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
            only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
            Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive in
            respect of such Company Certificate pursuant to the provisions of
            this Article II, certain dividends or other distributions, if any,
            in accordance with Section 2.2(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional
            share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2(e). No
            interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders
            of Company Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article
            II.

      (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date on or
after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby, and, in the case of Company Certificates representing Company Common
Stock, no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), and all such dividends, other distributions
and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be paid by
Parent to the Exchange

                                       5

<PAGE>

Agent and will be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the
surrender of such Company Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws, following surrender
of any such Company Certificate, there will be paid to the holder of the
certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and, in the case of Company Certificates representing Company Common Stock, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with
a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

      (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II, together with the
Cash Consideration (and any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(e)) will be deemed
to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Company
Certificates, and there will be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they will be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as otherwise provided by Law.

      (e) No Fractional Shares.

            (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
      Parent Common Stock will be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
      Company Certificates, no dividend or distribution on or with respect to
      Parent Common Stock will relate to such fractional share interests and
      such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote
      or to any rights of a shareholder of Parent.

            (ii) In lieu of the issuance of fractional shares, the Exchange
      Agent shall sell such number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock in the
      open market in order to pay each holder of Company Common Stock entitled
      to receive a fractional share, after aggregating all fractional shares to
      which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled, of
      Parent Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
      multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such former holder
      (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at the
      Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the
      Average Closing Price.

            (iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount
      of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Certificates formerly
      representing Company Common Stock with respect to any fractional share
      interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such
      holders of Company Certificates


                                       6
<PAGE>

      formerly representing Company Common Stock subject to and in accordance
      with the terms of Section 2.2(c).

      (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Certificates for one year
after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Company Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II may thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for
payment of their claim for Stock Consideration, any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock and Cash Consideration, provided that the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to be liable for any payments required to be made
thereafter pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and Section 2.4 hereof.

      (g) No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent will be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent
Common Stock, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or any cash from the Exchange
Fund, in each case, delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

      (h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis within
the guidelines set forth in Section 2.2(a). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments will be paid to Parent.

      (i) Lost Certificates. If any Company Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Company Certificate the Merger Consideration and, if applicable,
any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, in
each case, due to such person pursuant to this Agreement.

      Section 2.3 Certain Adjustments. If after the date of this Agreement and
at or prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, stock split, subdivision,
combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in stock or other
securities is declared thereon or rights issued in respect thereof with a record
date within such period, or any similar event occurs (any such action, an
"ADJUSTMENT EVENT"), each of the Exchange Ratio, Stock Consideration and the
Cash Consideration will be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide
to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect and percentage
ownership of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, stock split, subdivision,
combination, exchange or dividend or similar event. Nothing stated herein shall
permit Parent or the Company to take any action that is prohibited under this
Agreement.

      Section 2.4 Dissenters' Rights. Shares of Company Common Stock that have
not been voted for adoption of this Agreement and with respect to which
appraisal must have been properly demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL ("DISSENTING SHARES") will not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration at or after the Effective Time unless and until the holder
of such shares (a "DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER") withdraws his, her or its demand for
such appraisal (in accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or becomes
ineligible for such appraisal. If a holder of Dissenting Shares withdraws (in
accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) his, her or its demand for such
appraisal or becomes ineligible for such appraisal, then, as of the Effective
Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, each of such
holder's Dissenting Shares will cease to be a Dissenting Share and will be
converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments received by the
Company relating to shareholders' rights of appraisal. Parent shall conduct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL and the Company will be entitled to participate in such negotiations only
as and to the extent requested by Parent. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, compromise or offer to settle or settle any
such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

      Section 2.5 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name
and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger.

      Section 2.6 Withholding Rights. The Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such
amounts withheld shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

                                  ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      Section 3.1 Representations and Warranties of Company. Except as otherwise
set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter (as defined in Section 3.1(b)), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:



                                       8

      (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of Delaware, and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted. Each of the Company Subsidiaries (as defined in
Section 3.1(b)) is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such
concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the
requisite corporate or other applicable entity power, as the case may be, and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or result in a
material adverse effect on the Company. The Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or
result in a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has made
available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement complete and
correct copies of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, each as amended
to date.

      (b) Subsidiaries. Section 3.1(b) of the disclosure letter delivered by the
Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "COMPANY
DISCLOSURE LETTER"), sets forth all the subsidiaries of the Company (each a
"COMPANY SUBSIDIARY," collectively, the "COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES," and together
with the Company, the "COMPANY ENTITIES"), specifying those that are Significant
Subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT")). All outstanding shares
of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Company Subsidiary (i)
have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, (ii) are free and
clear of all Liens (as defined in Section 9.3) and (iii) are free of any other

      (h) Compliance with Applicable Laws; Litigation; Regulatory Matters.

            (i) The operations of the Company Entities since March 1, 2002 have
      not been and are not being conducted in violation of any Law (including
      the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001) or any
      Permit (as defined in Section 3.1(h)(ii)) applicable to or held by (as the
      case may be) the Company Entities, except where such violations,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not have or result in a material
      adverse effect on the Company. Since March 1, 2002, none of the Company
      Entities has received any written notice alleging any such violation,
      except where such violations, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company.

      consents, authorizations, waivers, grants, franchises, concessions,
      exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of Governmental Entities
      necessary for the conduct of their respective businesses as currently
      conducted ("PERMITS"), except where the failure to hold such Permits,

      adverse effect on the Company. Since March 1, 2002, none of the Company
      Entities has received written notice that any Permit will be terminated or
      modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of business except
      for such terminations, modifications or nonrenewals as, individually or in

      the Company. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
      the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
      not violate any Permit, except for such violations thereof as,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have
      or result in a material adverse effect on the Company.

            (iii) There is no investigation by a Governmental Entity or
      litigation, arbitration, or administrative proceeding pending against or,
      to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any
      Company Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement that, if decided
      adversely to such person, would have or result in a

                                       16

      material adverse effect on the Company, or that seeks to enjoin or
      otherwise challenges the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
      this Agreement.

      "misbranded" within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics
      Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
      "FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETICS ACT") or, except as individually or in the
      aggregate, would not have or result in a material adverse effect on the
      Company, labeled contrary to the Food and Drugs Act, Canada and Consumer
      Packaging and Labeling Act, Canada, as amended, and the rules and
      regulations promulgated thereunder (the "CANADA ACT"), and no recall of
      any of such products is currently being considered by the Company or any
      Company Subsidiary or, to the Company's knowledge, has been requested,
      ordered or threatened in writing by any Governmental Entity (including the
      Canadian Food Inspection Agency) or consumer group.

      stock purchase, stock option, phantom stock, retirement, vacation,
      employment, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical insurance,
      life insurance, severance or other employee benefit plan, agreement or
      arrangement maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or to
      which the Company or any Company Subsidiary contributes or is obligated to
      contribute or with respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
      has any liability, other than a plan or program operated by a Governmental
      Entity (such as government-operated workers' compensation or Social
      Security), and (B) each change of control agreement providing benefits to
      any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any
      Company Subsidiary, to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
      party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound
      (collectively, the "COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS"). For purposes of this
      Agreement, the term "COMPANY FOREIGN PLAN" refers to each plan, agreement
      or arrangement that is subject to or governed by the laws of any
      jurisdiction other than the United States and that would have been treated
      as a Company Benefit Plan had it been a United States plan, agreement or
      arrangement, other than a plan or program operated by a Governmental
      Entity (such as a government-operated provincial health plan or the Canada
      Pension Plan). Section 3.1(i)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
      forth a true and correct list of the Company Foreign Plans. With respect
      to each Company Benefit Plan and Company Foreign Plan, no event has
      occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in
      connection with which the Company or any Company Subsidiary would be
      subject to any liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would
      have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company.

            (ii) Each Company Benefit Plan and its administration is in
      compliance with all applicable Laws, including the Employee Retirement
      Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and the Code, if
      applicable, and with the


                                       17

<PAGE>

      terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any
      failures that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or result
      in a material adverse effect on the Company. Each Company Benefit Plan
      that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a), 401(k) or
      4975(e)(7) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
      the IRS as to its qualified status that covers the Uruguay Round Agreement
      Act (GATT), the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the Reemployment Rights Act
      of 1994 (USERRA), the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform
      Act of 1998, the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 and the
      Community Renewal Act of 2000. All contributions to, and payments from,
      the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made in
      accordance with such Company Benefit Plans, ERISA or the Code have been
      made other than any failures that, individually or in the aggregate, would
      not have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company. All trusts
      providing funding for Company Benefit Plans that are intended to comply
      with Section 501(c)(9) of the Code are exempt from federal income taxation
      and, together with any other welfare benefit funds (as defined in Section
      419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in connection with any of the Company
      Benefit Plans, have been operated and administered in compliance with all
      applicable requirements such that none of the Company, any Company
      Subsidiary, any Company Benefit Plan or such trust or fund is subject to
      any Taxes, penalties or other liabilities imposed as a consequence of
      failure to comply with such requirements which, individually or in the
      aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Company. No welfare
      benefit fund (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in
      connection with any of the Company Benefit Plans has provided any
      "disqualified benefit" (as defined in Section 4976(b)(1) of the Code) for
      which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has or had any liability for
      the excise tax imposed by Section 4976 of the Code which has not been paid
      in full, except as would not have or result in a material adverse effect
      on the Company.

            (iii) Neither the Company nor any trade or business, whether or not
      incorporated, which, together with the Company, would be deemed to be a
      "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA or
      Sections 414(b) or (c) of the Code (an "ERISA AFFILIATE") has incurred any
      liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for premiums pursuant to
      Section 4007 of ERISA which have been timely paid) or Section 4971 of the
      Code that has not been satisfied. No Company Benefit Plan has or within
      the three years preceding the date of this Agreement has incurred an
      accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA
      or Section 412 of the Code, nor is there any request pending before the
      Internal Revenue Service for any waiver of the minimum funding standards
      of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, nor has there been
      any prior such request granted with respect to any Company Benefit Plan
      where the minimum funding commitment has not yet been satisfied, nor has
      any Lien in favor of any Company Benefit Plan arisen under Section 412(n)
      of the Code or Section 302(f) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
      Affiliate has been required to provide security to any defined benefit
      pension plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code that has not been
      released. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to
      Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, the
      fair market value of the assets of such Company Benefit Plan equals or
      exceeds the actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such
      Company Benefit Plan (whether or not vested), based upon the actuarial

                                       18

<PAGE>

      assumptions used to prepare the most recent actuarial report for such
      Company Benefit Plan. There has been no "reportable event" within the
      meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations and interpretations
      thereunder which required a notice to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
      Corporation (the "PBGC") which has not been fully and accurately reported
      in a timely fashion, as required, or which, whether or not reported, would
      constitute grounds for the PBGC to institute involuntary termination
      proceedings with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is subject to
      Title IV of ERISA.

            (iv) No Company Benefit Plan provides medical or life insurance
      benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former
      employees or officers or directors after retirement or other termination
      of service, other than any such coverage required by Law and with respect
      to any Company Benefit Plan, to the knowledge of the Company, the Company
      and the Company Subsidiaries have reserved all rights necessary to amend
      or terminate each of such plans without the consent of any other person.

            (v) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
      Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (A)
      entitle any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company
      or any Company Subsidiary to severance pay, unemployment compensation or
      any other payment that would not have been payable if such transactions
      had not been consummated, or (B) accelerate the time of payment or
      vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee,
      officer or director.

            (vi) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to
      any agreement, contract or arrangement (including this Agreement) that
      would result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any
      "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
      Code. No Company Benefit Plan provides for the reimbursement of excise
      taxes under Section 4999 of the Code or any income taxes under the Code.

            (vii) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has
      made available to Parent a true and complete copy of: (A) each writing
      constituting a current part of such Company Benefit Plan, including all
      current Company Benefit Plan documents and trust agreements, and all
      amendments thereto; (B) the most recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series)
      and accompanying schedules, if any; (C) the most recent annual financial
      report, if any; (D) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (E) the
      most recent determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, if
      any. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made an
      enforceable commitment to make any new amendments to, or to adopt or
      approve any new, Company Benefit Plan.

            (viii) No Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan (as defined
      in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN") or a plan that
      has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
      common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "MULTIPLE
      EMPLOYER PLAN"). None of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor any of
      their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six
      years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer
      Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

      (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
      arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, or to the Company's
      knowledge, threatened against the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries
      thereof with respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the
      assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans that
      could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of the
      Company or any Company Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the United States
      Department of Treasury, the United States Department of Labor, any
      Multiemployer Plan, any Company Benefit Plan or any participant in a
      Company Benefit Plan.

            (x) There have been no prohibited transactions or breaches of any of
      the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21)
      of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Company Benefit Plans that would
      result in any material liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code
      being imposed on the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

            (xi) With respect to each Company Foreign Plan, except as would not
      have or result in a material adverse effect on the Company: (A) all
      amounts required to be reserved under each book reserved Company Foreign
      Plan have been so reserved in accordance with reasonable accounting
      practices prevailing in the country where such Company Foreign Plan is

      claims relating thereto (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary
      course of business) that are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
      threatened by any current or former employee of the Company or the Company
      Subsidiaries, any collective bargaining agent, any Governmental Entity or
      by any other person in relation to any Company Foreign Plan or the assets
      of the trust thereunder; (D) with respect to each Company Foreign Plan,
      the Company has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of: (1)

      recent Annual Information Return filed for any Company Foreign Plan that

      the most recent plan description provided to employees of the Company or

      Subsidiary has announced or made an enforceable commitment to make any new
      amendments to, or to adopt or approve any new, Company Foreign Plan; (F)
      no Company Foreign Plan provides medical or life insurance or other
      welfare benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or

to make available investment opportunities to any person on a priority, equal or
exclusive basis, (iv) that is a collective bargaining agreement or similar
agreement, (v) any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of

between any affiliate of the Company (other than any Company Subsidiary), on the
one hand, and the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, are on

      Section 3.2 Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub.
Except as otherwise set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter (as defined in
Section 3.2(b)), each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to
the Company as follows:

      (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Parent is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Ohio,
and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as
now being conducted. Each of the Parent Subsidiaries (as defined in Section
3.2(b)) is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept)
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the
requisite corporate or other applicable entity power, as the case may be, and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or result in a
material adverse effect on Parent. All outstanding stock of Merger Sub is owned
by Parent. Parent and each of the Parent Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions
that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, individually
or in the aggregate, would not have or result in a material adverse effect on
Parent or Merger Sub. Parent has made available to the Company prior to the
execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of its Amended Articles
of Incorporation and Code of Regulations, each as amended to date.

      (b) Subsidiaries. Section 3.2(b) of the disclosure letter delivered by
Parent to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "PARENT
DISCLOSURE LETTER"), sets forth all the subsidiaries of Parent (each a "PARENT
SUBSIDIARY," collectively, the "PARENT SUBSIDIARIES," and together with Parent,
the "PARENT ENTITIES"), specifying those that are Significant Subsidiaries (as
defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act). All outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Parent Subsidiary
(i) have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, (ii) are free
and clear of all Liens and (iii) are free of any other restriction (including
any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other ownership interests), except, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any Liens or restrictions that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. All outstanding
shares of capital stock (or equivalent equity interests of entities other than
corporations) of each of the Parent Subsidiaries are beneficially owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent. Parent does not, directly or indirectly, own
more than 20% but less than 100% of the capital stock or other equity interest
in any person other than the Parent Subsidiaries.

      (c) Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists
entirely of 150,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and 6,000,000 shares of
Serial Preferred Stock without par value ("PARENT PREFERRED STOCK"), of which
1,500,000 shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Shares. At the close of business on March 5, 2004: (i) 50,102,603 shares of
Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding (including awards of restricted
stock); (ii) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding, and
(iii) 2,646,467 shares of Parent Common Stock were subject to outstanding
employee or director stock options to purchase Parent Common Stock or other

share purchase right (collectively, the "PARENT RIGHTS") issued pursuant to the
Amended and Restated Rights Agreement between Parent and Computershare Investor
Services, LLC, as Rights Agent, dated as of August 28, 2000 (the "PARENT RIGHTS
AGREEMENT"), which entitles the holder thereof to purchase, on the occurrence of
certain events, Parent Common Stock. All outstanding shares of capital stock of
Parent are, and all shares that may be issued will be, when issued, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and not subject to or
issued in violation of preemptive rights. All shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger will entitle the holders thereof to one vote on each
matter properly submitted to the shareholders of Parent for their vote, consent,
waiver, release, or other action, including any vote or consent for the election
or removal of directors; provided, however, that such shares will entitle the
holders thereof to ten votes per share on each of the matters set forth in
Division II, Section 2(a) of Parent's Amended Articles of Incorporation, subject
to the limitations set forth therein. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to this Agreement, when issued in accordance with the terms of

not have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent or Merger Sub and that

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by Parent or Merger Sub in

      contemplated hereby, neither the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has any
      obligations or liabilities of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
      contingent or otherwise) as of the date of this Agreement that would have

date it is first mailed to the Company shareholders and Parent's shareholders or
at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting or the Parent Shareholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made by

reference therein supplied by or on behalf of the Company specifically for

      indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent to Parent or another wholly
      owned subsidiary of Parent, declared, set aside or paid any dividends on,
      or made any other distributions in respect of, any of its capital stock

      which the only parties are Parent and wholly owned subsidiaries of the
      Parent.

      (h) Compliance with Applicable Laws; Litigation; Regulatory Matters.

            (i) The operations of the Parent Entities since March 1, 2002 have
      not been and are not being conducted in violation of any Law (including
      the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001) or any
      Permit applicable to or held by (as the case may be) the Parent Entities,
      except where such violations, individually or in the aggregate, would not
      have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent. Since March 1,
      2002, none of the Parent Entities has received any written notice alleging
      any such violation, except where such violations, individually or in the
      aggregate, would not have or result in a material adverse effect on
      Parent.

            (ii) The Parent Entities hold all Permits, except where the failure
      to hold such Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or
      result in a material adverse effect on Parent. Since March 1, 2002, none
      of the Parent Entities has received written notice that any Permit will be
      terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of
      business except for such terminations, modifications or nonrenewals as,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not have or result in a material
      adverse effect on Parent. The execution, delivery and performance of this
      Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do
      not and will not violate any


                                       35

<PAGE>

      Permit, except for such violations thereof as, individually or in the
      aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a
      material adverse effect on Parent.

            (iii) There is no investigation by a Governmental Entity or
      litigation, arbitration, or administrative proceeding pending against or,
      to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any Parent
      Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement that, if decided adversely to
      such person, would have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent,
      or that seeks to enjoin or otherwise challenges the consummation of the
      transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            (iv) Except as set forth on Section 3.2(h)(iv) of the Parent
      Disclosure Letter, from March 1, 2002, no products sold or manufactured by
      Parent or any Parent Subsidiary have been recalled voluntarily or
      involuntarily or have been "adulterated" or "misbranded" within the
      meaning of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act or, except as individually or
      in the aggregate, would not have or result in a material adverse effect on
      Parent, labeled contrary to the Canada Act, and no recall of any of such
      products is currently being considered by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
      or, to Parent's knowledge, has been requested, ordered or threatened in
      writing by any Governmental Entity or consumer group.

      (i) Employee Benefit Plans.

            (i) Each (A) United States bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred
      compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase,
      stock option, phantom stock, retirement, vacation, employment, disability,
      death benefit, hospitalization, medical insurance, life insurance,
      severance or other employee benefit plan, agreement or arrangement
      maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or to which Parent or any
      Parent Subsidiary contributes or is obligated to contribute or with
      respect to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has any liability, other
      than a plan or program operated by a Governmental Entity (such as
      government-operated workers' compensation or Social Security), and (B)
      change of control agreement providing benefits to any current or former
      employee, officer or director of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, to which
      Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which Parent or any
      Parent Subsidiary is bound is referred to herein collectively as the
      "PARENT BENEFIT PLANS." For purposes of this Agreement, the term "PARENT
      FOREIGN PLAN" refers to each plan, agreement or arrangement that is
      subject to or governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
      United States and that would have been treated as a Parent Benefit Plan
      had it been a United States plan, agreement or arrangement, other than a
      plan or program operated by a Governmental Entity (such as a
      government-operated provincial health plan or the Canada Pension Plan).
      With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan and Parent Foreign Plan, no event
      has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in
      connection with which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary would be subject to
      any liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would have or result
      in a material adverse effect on Parent.

            (ii) Each Parent Benefit Plan and its administration is in
      compliance with all applicable Laws, including ERISA, and the Code, if
      applicable, and with the terms of all applicable collective bargaining
      agreements, except for any failures that,


                                       36


<PAGE>

      individually or in the aggregate, would not have or result in a material
      adverse effect on Parent. Each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to be
      qualified under Section 401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code has
      received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its qualified
      status that covers the Uruguay Round Agreement Act (GATT), the Taxpayer
      Relief Act of 1997, the Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), the
      Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, the Small
      Business Job Protection Act of 1996 and the Community Renewal Act of 2000.
      All contributions to, and payments from, Parent Benefit Plans that are
      required to have been made in accordance with such Parent Benefit Plans,
      ERISA or the Code have been timely made other than any failures that,
      individually or in the aggregate, would not have or result in a material
      adverse effect on Parent. All trusts providing funding for Parent Benefit
      Plans that are intended to comply with Section 501(c)(9) of the Code are
      exempt from federal income taxation and, together with any other welfare
      benefit funds (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in
      connection with any of Parent Benefit Plans, have been operated and
      administered in compliance with all applicable requirements such that none
      of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, any Parent Benefit Plan or such trust or
      fund is subject to any Taxes, penalties or other liabilities imposed as a
      consequence of failure to comply with such requirements which,
      individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on
      Parent. No welfare benefit fund (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the
      Code) maintained in connection with any of Parent Benefit Plans has
      provided any "disqualified benefit" (as defined in Section 4976(b)(1) of
      the Code) for which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has or had any
      liability for the excise tax imposed by Section 4976 of the Code which has
      not been paid in full, except as would not have or result in a material
      adverse effect on Parent.

            (iii) Neither Parent nor any trade or business, whether or not
      incorporated, which, together with Parent, would be deemed to be an ERISA
      Affiliate, has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than
      for premiums pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA which have been timely
      paid) or Section 4971 of the Code that has not been satisfied. No Parent
      Benefit Plan has or has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within
      the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor is
      there any request pending before the Internal Revenue Service for any
      waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA and
      Section 412 of the Code been requested of or granted by the Internal
      Revenue Service with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan nor has any lien
      in favor of any Parent Benefit Plan arisen under Section 412(n) of the
      Code or Section 302(f) of ERISA. Neither Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate
      has been required to provide security to any defined benefit pension plan
      pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code that has not been released.
      With respect to each Parent Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
      Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, the fair market
      value of the assets of such Parent Benefit Plan equals or exceeds the
      actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such Parent Benefit
      Plan (whether or not vested), based upon the actuarial assumptions used to
      prepare the most recent actuarial report for such Parent Benefit Plan.
      There has been no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of
      ERISA and the regulations and interpretations thereunder which required a
      notice to the PBGC which has not been fully and accurately reported in a
      timely fashion, as required, or which, whether or not reported, would
      constitute grounds for the PBGC to institute involuntary


                                       37

<PAGE>

      termination proceedings with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that is
      subject to Title IV of ERISA.

            (iv) No Parent Benefit Plan provides medical or life insurance
      benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former
      employees or officers or directors after retirement or other termination
      of service, other than any such coverage required by law and with respect
      to any Parent Benefit Plan set forth on Section 3.2(i)(iv) of the Parent
      Disclosure Letter, Parent and Parent Subsidiaries have reserved all rights
      necessary to amend or terminate each of such plans without the consent of
      any other person.

            (v) Except as set forth on Section 3.2(i)(v) of the Parent
      Disclosure Letter, no Parent Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a
      Multiple Employer Plan. None of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of
      their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six
      years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer
      Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA. None
      of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
      Affiliates has incurred any material withdrawal liability under a
      Multiemployer Plan that has not been satisfied in full. None of Parent,
      the Parent Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates would
      incur any withdrawal liability (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E
      of Title I of ERISA) if Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their
      respective ERISA Affiliates withdrew (within the meaning of Part 1 of
      Subtitle E of Title I of ERISA) on or prior to the Closing Date from each
      Multiemployer Plan to which Parent, Parent Subsidiaries or any of their
      respective ERISA Affiliates has an obligation to contribute on the date of
      this Agreement. No Multiemployer Plan to which Parent, Parent Subsidiaries
      or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates contributes is in
      reorganization (within the meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA) or is
      reasonably likely to commence reorganization.

            (vi) Except as set forth on Section 3.2(i)(vi) of the Parent
      Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending
      claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits
      or arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, or to Parent's
      knowledge, threatened against the Parent Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries
      thereof with respect to their duties to Parent Benefit Plans or the assets
      of any of the trusts under any of Parent Benefit Plans that could
      reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of Parent or
      any Parent Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the United States Department of
      Treasury, the United States Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan,
      any Parent Benefit Plan or any participant in a Parent Benefit Plan.

            (vii) There have been no prohibited transactions or breaches of any
      of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section
      3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to Parent Benefit Plans that would
      result in any material liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code
      being imposed on Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries.

            (viii) With respect to each Parent Foreign Plan, except as would not
      have or result in a material adverse effect on Parent: (A) all amounts
      required to be reserved under each book reserved Parent Foreign Plan have
      been so reserved in accordance with

bankers, representatives and agents retained by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES") to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated immediately all existing activities, discussions and
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (as
defined in Section 4.2(b)). From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, the Company
shall not, nor shall it permit any of the Company Subsidiaries to, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its or the Company Subsidiaries' Representatives to,

enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated

discussions or



                                       50

<PAGE>

negotiations regarding, or furnish or disclose to any person (other than a party
to this Agreement) any information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate or in furtherance of any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover
Proposal or (iv) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or any similar
agreement with respect to any class of the Company's equity securities (other
than the standstill provision contained in the Confidentiality Agreement which
shall be deemed waived and released if the Company takes any action pursuant to
the proviso contained in this Section 4.2(a)); provided, however, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response to a bona fide
written Company Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and its
financial advisor) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 4.2(b)), and which Company Takeover
Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof and was made after the date
hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.2, the
Company may, subject to compliance with Section 4.2(c), (i) furnish information
with respect to, and access to the properties, books, records, and personnel of,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such person than the
Confidentiality Agreement (excluding the standstill provision contained
therein), and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person
making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) regarding such
Company Takeover Proposal.

      (b) Definitions. As used herein, (i) "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a bona fide
written Company Takeover Proposal (provided that for purposes of this definition
references to "10% or more" or "25% or more" in the definition of "Company
Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed references to "50% or more") that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment consistent
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL
after consulting with the Company's Banker (or any other nationally recognized
investment banking firm and outside legal counsel), taking into account all
legal, financial and regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person
making the proposal (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions, the absence, if such is the case, of committed financing to the
extent financing is a condition to consummation of the Company Takeover
Proposal, and other conditions to consummation), would be more favorable to the
shareholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in
response to such Company Takeover Proposal pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii)) and
is reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms proposed and (ii)
"COMPANY TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person
other than Parent or its affiliates or Representatives relating to any (A)
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 25% or
more of the net revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of 10% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or
(D) any merger, consolidation, business combination, purchase of consolidated
assets of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries (other than the purchase of
inventory or obsolete equipment in the ordinary course of business),
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction


                                       51

<PAGE>

involving, in each case, 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company
and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than, in each case, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

      (c) Actions by the Company. Neither the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such
Board of Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt
or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Company
Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as
a "COMPANY ADVERSE RECOMMENDATION CHANGE") or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other
similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.2(a)) (an "ACQUISITION
AGREEMENT"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the
Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment consistent with
its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL after
consulting with outside legal counsel that it is required to do so in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties. Any Company Adverse Recommendation Change
shall not change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for
purposes of causing any antitakeover provision in the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws or any Takeover Statute or other state Law to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger or
otherwise affect any other obligation of the Company under this Agreement. The
Company shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Company Takeover
Proposal other than the Merger prior to the termination of this Agreement.

      (d) Notice of Company Takeover Proposal. From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall promptly (but in any event within one calendar day)
advise Parent and Merger Sub in writing of the receipt, directly or indirectly,
of any Company Takeover Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information
relating to any of the Company Entities by any person that informs the Company
or its Representatives that such person is considering making, or has made, a
Company Takeover Proposal, or an inquiry from a person seeking to have
discussions or negotiations relating to a possible Company Takeover Proposal.
Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate
the specific terms and conditions thereof (but need not identify the other party
or parties involved) and promptly inform Parent and Merger Sub of any
information provided to such third party thereto. The Company agrees that it
shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and details (including
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request, Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry and keep Parent reasonably informed as to discussions or
negotiations with respect to any such request, Company Takeover Proposal or
inquiry.

      (e) Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9. Nothing contained in this Section 4.2
shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by



                                       52

<PAGE>

Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a
Company Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that compliance with such rules
and Laws shall not in any way limit or modify the effect that any action taken
pursuant to such rules and Laws has under Section 7.1(c).

      (f) Return or Destruction of Confidential Information. The Company agrees
that promptly following the execution of this Agreement, it shall request each
person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement since January 1,
2002 in connection with such person's consideration of acquiring the Company to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
person by or on the Company's behalf.

the Proxy Statement and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4,

Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after

laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and

of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will
be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy
Statement will be made by the Company or Parent, in each case, without providing
the other party and its respective counsel the reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Form S-4 or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such



                                       53

<PAGE>

information must be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

      (b) Company Obligations. The Company shall take such action as may be
necessary to ensure that (i) the information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4
shall not at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act

made, not misleading, and (ii) the information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement shall
not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to shareholders of Parent
or the Company, at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting and the Parent
Shareholders Meeting, or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made in the Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to
the solicitation of proxies for the Company Shareholders Meeting or the Parent
Shareholders Meeting that has become false or misleading.

      (c) Parent Obligations. Parent shall take such action as may be necessary
to ensure that (i) the information supplied by or on behalf of Parent
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 shall
not at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated in the Form S-4 or necessary in order to make the
statements in the Form S-4, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and (ii) the information supplied by or on behalf of
Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement shall

a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made in the Proxy Statement, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, or omit to state any material fact
necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to
the solicitation of proxies for the Company Shareholders Meeting or the Parent
Shareholders Meeting that has become false or misleading.

      (d) Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold, a meeting of its shareholders (the "COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS
MEETING") in accordance with Law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and
the Company's By-laws for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval and shall, (i) through the Board of Directors of the Company, subject
to Section 4.2, recommend to its shareholders the approval and adoption of this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)

be affected by any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or its
shareholders of any Company Takeover Proposal.

      Section 5.6 Stock Plans and Company Stock Options.

      (a) Assumption of Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, (i) each
outstanding Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested immediately prior
to the Effective Time, to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) each
of the Company Stock Plans and all agreements thereunder, shall be assumed by
Parent. To the extent provided under the terms of the Company Stock Plans all
such outstanding options shall accelerate and become immediately exercisable in
connection with the Merger in accordance with their existing terms. Except for
the acceleration of the Company Stock Options in accordance with the terms of
the Company Stock Plans and any agreements thereunder, prior to or at the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, substantially the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Stock Plans and the
documents governing the Company Stock Options immediately before the Effective
Time, except that (i) each Company Stock Option will be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the sum of the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration
plus the Option Calculation Shares (as defined below) and rounded to the next
highest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the per-share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the sum of the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration plus the
Option Calculation Shares, rounded to the next highest whole cent, and (iii)
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to amend the 1986 Stock Option
Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 1989 Stock-Based Incentive Plan to
provide, or otherwise cause to be provided, that vested options of employees
will be exercisable for a period of 90 days following termination of employment
other than for cause (except to the extent such stock option plan contains terms
relating to exercise following termination that are more favorable to the
employee than such 90 day exercise period but no later than the expiration of
the stock option if employment had not been terminated). "OPTION CALCULATION
SHARES" means the number equal to the quotient determined by dividing the Cash
Consideration by the Average Closing Price. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, in the case of any incentive stock option to which
Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422
of the Code, the formulas and other provisions set forth herein shall be
adjusted to the extent necessary to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code.

      (b) Reservation of Option Shares. Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common
Stock for delivery upon exercise of all Company Stock Options assumed in
accordance with this Section 5.6. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
appropriate form) or a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 for purposes of
registering all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable after the Effective Time
upon exercise of those options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for so long as those
options remain outstanding.




                                       58

<PAGE>


      (c) Restricted Stock. To the extent provided under the terms of the
Company Stock Plans or any agreements thereunder, all restricted common stock of
the Company shall vest, and all restrictions thereon shall lapse at or prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with the terms thereof and such restricted
common stock shall constitute Company Common Stock subject to Article II.

      (d) Restricted Stock Units. To the extent provided under the terms of the
Company Stock Plans or any agreements thereunder, all restricted stock units of
the Company shall be deemed to vest and to constitute issued and outstanding
Company Common Stock subject to Article II immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

      Section 5.7 Indemnification, Assumption.

      (a) Rights Assumed by Surviving Corporation. Parent agrees that all rights
to indemnification, indemnification expense advancement, and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") as provided in
their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) or in indemnification agreements will be assumed by
the Surviving Corporation without further action, as of the Effective Time, and
will survive the Merger and will continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms and such rights will not be amended, or otherwise modified for
a period of six years after the Effective Time (and no such amendment or
modification shall affect a claim asserted prior to the amendment or
modification) in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of
individuals who on or prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, unless such
modification is required by Law. Parent hereby guarantees, effective at the
Effective Time, all obligations of the Surviving Corporation in respect of such
indemnification, exculpation and expense advancement.

      (b) Successors and Assigns of Surviving Corporation. In the event that the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.7.

      (c) Continuing Coverage. For at least six years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall maintain (or cause to be maintained) in effect directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time with respect to those Indemnified Parties who are currently
covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (a
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) on terms with
respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such current
insurance coverage; provided, however, that in no event will Parent be required
to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and provided, further, that,
if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent
will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.





                                       59

<PAGE>

      (d) Intended Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 5.7 are (i)
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

      (e) Key Employee Arrangements. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
acknowledge that, by operation of Law, the Surviving Corporation will be
obligated, from and after the Effective Time, to perform, in the same manner and
to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if the Merger
had not taken place, the Company's obligations under each of the employment,
severance, retention bonus, change in control, and similar arrangements listed
in Section 5.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent shall guarantee the
performance of the Surviving Corporation's obligations with respect to the
arrangements listed on Section 5.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

      Section 5.8 Fees and Expenses.

      (a) Division of Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in this Section 5.8,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby must be paid by the party incurring such
fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that each of
Parent and the Company will bear and pay one-half of the costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and
the Proxy Statement (including SEC filing fees).

      (b) Event of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to (i) Section 7.1(b)(i), Section 7.1(b)(ii), or Section 7.1(c)(i) (but
only with respect to the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) and Section
6.2(b)) and (A) prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, a Company Takeover
Proposal shall have been made to the Company and shall have become known
publicly or been made directly to the Company's shareholders generally or any
person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional)
to make a Company Takeover Proposal and (B) within 12 months after such
termination the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (1) enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal within such
twelve-month period which Company Takeover Proposal is subsequently consummated
within or after such twelve-month period, or (2) consummates any Company
Takeover Proposal or (ii) Section 7.1(c)(ii) or (iii) Section 7.1(d)(ii) then,
the Company shall (1) in the case of termination pursuant to clause (i) of this
Section 5.8(b), upon such consummation or (2) in the case of termination
pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5.8(b), promptly, but in no event later
than two Business Days after the date of such termination, or (3) in the case of
termination pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 5.8(b) immediately prior to
such termination, pay Parent a non-refundable fee equal to $17,000,000 (the
"TERMINATION FEE"), payable by wire transfer of same day funds to an account
designated in writing to the Company by Parent. For purposes of determining
whether a Company Takeover Proposal has occurred that may entitle Parent to a
Termination Fee, references to "10% or more" or "25% or more" in the definition
of "Company Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be "50% or more." The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 5.8(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly the amount due pursuant to
this Section 5.8(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company



                                       60

<PAGE>

for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee. In no event
shall more than one Termination Fee be payable under this Section 5.8(b). Parent
(for itself and its affiliates) hereby agrees that, upon any termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where Parent is entitled to a Termination Fee
under this Section 5.8(b) and such Termination Fee is paid in full to Parent,
Parent and its affiliates shall be precluded from any other remedy against the
Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither Parent nor any of its
affiliates shall seek (and Parent shall cause its affiliates not to seek) to
obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect, or punitive damages, against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers,
members, or shareholders in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

      Section 5.9 Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before holding any press
conferences, analysts calls or other meetings or discussions and before issuing
any press release or other public announcements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. The parties will provide
each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or other
public announcement or statement with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press
release or other public announcement or statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange. The
parties agree that the initial press release or releases to be issued with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be mutually
agreed upon prior to the issuance thereof, which agreement shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

      Section 5.10 Affiliates. The Company shall deliver to Parent at least 45
days prior to the Closing Date a letter identifying all persons who are, in the
Company's reasonable judgment, at the time this Agreement is submitted for
adoption by the shareholders of the Company, "affiliates" of the Company for
purposes of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations promulgated under the
Securities Act. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause each such
person to deliver to Parent at least 30 days prior to the Closing Date a written
agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto.

      Section 5.11 NYSE Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause (i) the Parent Common Stock issuable to the Company's shareholders as
contemplated by this Agreement (including pursuant to Parent's assumption of the
Company Stock Options) to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and in any event prior to the Closing Date and (ii) the Company
Common Stock to be delisted from the NYSE.

      Section 5.12 Shareholder Litigation. The parties to this Agreement shall
cooperate and consult with one another, to the fullest extent possible, in
connection with any shareholder litigation against any of them or any of their
respective directors or officers with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In furtherance of and without in any way limiting the
foregoing, each of the parties shall use its respective reasonable best efforts
to prevail in such litigation so as to permit the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by




                                       61

<PAGE>

this Agreement in the manner contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company agrees that prior to the termination of this Agreement,
it will not compromise or settle any litigation commenced against it or its
directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) without Parent's prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

      Section 5.13 Tax Treatment. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain
the opinions of counsel referred to in Sections 6.2(c) and 6.3(c), including
forbearing from taking any action that would cause the Merger not to qualify as
a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code.

      Section 5.14 Transition. In order to facilitate an orderly transition of
the management of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
Parent and in order to facilitate the integration of the operations of the
Company and Parent and its subsidiaries and to permit the coordination of their
related operations on a timely basis, and in an effort to accelerate to the
earliest time possible following the Effective Time the realization of
synergies, operating efficiencies and other benefits expected to the realized by
Parent and the Company as a result of the Merger, the Company shall and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to consult with Parent on all material strategic
and operational matters to the extent such consultation is not in violation of
applicable Law, including Laws regarding the exchange of information and other
Laws regarding competition. The Company shall and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to make available to Parent at the facilities of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, where reasonably determined by Parent to be
appropriate and necessary, office space in order to assist it in observing
operations and reviewing matters concerning the Company's affairs. Without in
any way limiting the provisions of Section 5.4, Parent, its subsidiaries,
officers, employees, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
shall, upon reasonable written notice to the Company, be entitled to review the
operations and visit the facilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
at all reasonable times in order to accomplish the foregoing arrangements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's
operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and the Company Subsidiaries'
respective operations.

extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR

shall have issued an advance ruling certificate under Section 102 of the

<PAGE>

Commissioner of Competition nor the Competition Tribunal as authorized under the
Canadian Act shall have taken, or have indicated their intention to take, any
action under the Canadian Act, whether before or after the Closing Date, which

waiver of the following conditions:

the Company contained in Section 3.1(c) must be true and correct in all material
respects (except for the representations and warranties contained in the first
two sentences of Section 3.1(c) which must be true and correct in all respects
unless the failure to be so true and correct is insignificant) both when made
and on and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date
(except representations or warranties expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such date), and all other representations and warranties of the
Company set forth herein must be true and correct in all respects (without
giving effect to any materiality or material adverse effect qualifications
contained therein) both when made and on and as of the Closing Date, as though
made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the failure of such
other representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not have or
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
Company.

      (b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company must have
performed in all material respects all of its obligations required to be
performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date.

      (c) Tax Opinion. Parent must have received from Jones Day, counsel to
Parent, an opinion dated on or about the date the Proxy Statement is first
mailed to shareholders of the Company and Parent and updated as of the Closing
Date, to the effect that, on the basis of the facts, representations and
assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the Merger will constitute
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company will each be a party to such reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel
for Parent may require delivery of, and rely upon, the Tax Certificates.

      (d) No Material Adverse Change. At any time after the date of this
Agreement, there must not have occurred any material adverse change relating to
the Company.

certificate dated the Closing Date signed on its behalf by an executive officer
to the effect that the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) and 6.2(b) have
been satisfied.

the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to satisfaction or waiver of
the following conditions:

      (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth herein must be true and correct in all respects
(without giving effect to any materiality or material adverse effect
qualifications contained therein) both when made and on and as of the Closing
Date, as though made on and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made
as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the failure
of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not have
or result in, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on
Parent or Merger Sub.

      (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub must have performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing
Date.

Statement is first mailed to shareholders of the Company and Parent and updated
as of the Closing Date, to the effect that, on the basis of the facts,
representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the
Merger will constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code, and Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will each be a party to such

                        TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

      Section 7.1 Termination.

      (a) Termination by Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company
Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval, by mutual written
consent of Parent and the Company.

      (b) Termination by Parent or the Company. This Agreement may be terminated
at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company
Shareholder Approval or Parent Shareholder Approval, by either Parent or the
Company:

            (i) if the Merger has not been consummated by December 31, 2004 or
      such later date, if any, as Parent and the Company agree upon (the
      "TERMINATION DATE");



                                       66

<PAGE>

      provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
      this Section 7.1(b)(i) is not available to any party whose material breach
      of any provision of this Agreement results in or causes the failure of the
      Merger to be consummated by such time;

            (ii) if the Company Shareholders Meeting (including any adjournment
      or postponement thereof) has concluded and the Company Shareholder
      Approval was not obtained;

            (iii) if the Parent Shareholder Meeting (including any adjournment
      or postponement thereof) has concluded and the Parent Shareholder Approval
      is not obtained; or

            (iv) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(c)
      is in effect and has become final and nonappealable; provided, however,
      that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
      7.1(b)(iv) is not available to any party whose material breach of any
      provision of this Agreement results in or causes such Restraint or the
      failure of such Restraint to be removed.

      (c) Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Shareholder
Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval, by Parent:

            (i) if any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2 shall
      become incapable of being fulfilled at any time on or before the
      Termination Date and shall not have been waived by Parent and Parent shall
      have provided the Company with written notice of its intent to terminate
      this Agreement pursuant to this clause (i) at least 5 Business Days prior
      to the effective date of such termination; provided, however, that the
      inability to fulfill the condition is not due to the failure of Parent or
      Merger Sub to comply in all material respects with its obligations under
      this Agreement; or

            (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
      thereof has (1) made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (2) approved
      or recommended, or proposed to or announced any intention to approve or
      recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, (3) proposed or announced any
      intention to enter into or entered into any Acquisition Agreement (other
      than a customary confidentiality agreement in compliance with Section
      4.2), with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal except to the extent
      required in Section 7.1(d)(ii) prior to the termination of this Agreement
      pursuant thereto; or (4) materially breached the provisions of Section 4.2
      or Section 5.1(d).

      (d) Termination by the Company. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company
Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval, by the Company,

            (i) if any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3 shall
      become incapable of being fulfilled at any time on or before the
      Termination Date and shall not have been waived by the Company and the
      Company shall have provided the Parent with



                                       67

<PAGE>

      written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
      clause (i) at least 5 Business Days prior to the effective date of such
      termination; provided, however, that the inability to fulfill the
      condition is not due to the failure of the Company to comply in all
      material respects with its obligations under this Agreement; or

            (ii) if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
      Approval, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company receives a Superior
      Proposal, (ii) three Business Days have elapsed following Parent's receipt
      of written notice (a "NOTICE OF SUPERIOR PROPOSAL") from the Company
      advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to
      terminate this Agreement and concurrently enter into an Acquisition
      Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal and specifying the terms
      and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the party
      making such Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by
      the Board of Directors (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
      to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
      Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new three
      Business Day period); (iii) during such three Business Day period the
      Company shall afford Parent a reasonable opportunity to make such
      adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
      the Company to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
      Agreement (as modified for such adjustments) and not terminate this
      Agreement because the Company Takeover Proposal is no longer a Superior
      Proposal as compared to the Merger on such adjusted terms, (iv) at the end
      of such three Business Day period (or periods, as applicable), the
      Company's Board of Directors continues reasonably to believe that the
      Company Takeover Proposal (as adjusted through any subsequent
      negotiations) that triggered the Notice of Superior Proposal constitutes a
      Superior Proposal as compared to the Merger (including any adjustments
      made pursuant to clause (iii)), (v) the Board of Directors of the Company
      concurrently approves, and the Company concurrently enters into, a
      definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, and (vi) at
      or prior to any termination pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(ii), the
      Company pays the Parent the Termination Fee as provided in Section 5.8.

      Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this
Agreement will forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability
or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, other than the
provisions of Section 5.8, Section 5.18, this Section 7.2, Section 7.3, Section
7.4 and Article IX, which provisions survive such termination; provided,
however, that nothing herein will relieve any party from any liability for any
willful and material breach by such party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

      Section 7.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after the Company Shareholder Approval or Parent Shareholder
Approval; provided, however, that, after the Company Shareholder Approval or
Parent Shareholder Approval, there is not to be made any amendment that by law
requires further approval by the shareholders of the Company without further
approval of such shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.





                                       68

      Section 7.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other party or parties (as the case may be), (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the other party or parties (as the case
may be) contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 7.3, waive compliance by
the other party or parties (as the case may be) with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to
any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME

Time and until December 31, 2005, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or one of its other subsidiaries to, provide welfare and pension

Employees (as herein defined) to the benefits that are (i) currently provided by
the Company to Full-Time Employees or (ii) from time to time provided by Parent
and its subsidiaries to their similarly situated full-time employees. For
purposes of this Article VIII, "FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES" means the employees who
were active full-time employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
immediately before the Effective Time and continue to be active full-time
employees of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of Parent's other
subsidiaries after the Effective Time.

      Section 8.2 Eligibility on or after Effective Time. With respect to any
Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Foreign Plan in which any Full-Time Employee first
becomes eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (by reason of the
extension of such plan to employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries, by reason of a merger of the analogous Company Benefit Plan or
Company Foreign Plan with the Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Foreign Plan, or
other reason), the Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to each such Full-Time Employee and his or her eligible
dependents under such Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Foreign Plan, except to the
extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods applied
immediately prior thereto under the analogous Company Benefit Plan or Company
Foreign Plan; (ii) provide such Full-Time Employee and his or her eligible
dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to
becoming eligible to participate in such Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Foreign
Plan under the analogous Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan (to the
same extent that such credit was given under such Company Benefit Plan or
Company Foreign Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or annual or
lifetime maximum out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Benefit Plan or
Parent Foreign Plan; and (iii) recognize all service of such Full-Time Employee
with the Company and its subsidiaries, and predecessors (including recognition
of all prior service with any entity, including any subsidiary of the Company
prior to its becoming a subsidiary of the Company, that was recognized by the
Company (or one of its subsidiaries) prior to the date hereof in the



                                       69

<PAGE>

ordinary course of administering its (or such subsidiary's) employee benefits),
for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting in benefits under such
Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Foreign Plan, to the extent that such service was
recognized for such purpose under the analogous Company Benefit Plan or Company
Foreign Plan.

and in Sections 5.6, 5.7, and 5.17, each of which will survive in accordance
with its terms.

consent of each other party. Any assignment in violation of this Section 9.7
will be void and of no effect. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this
Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of, and is enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

      Section 9.8 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for
leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery.

      Section 9.9 Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. The parties accordingly agree that the parties will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or a Delaware state court, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

      Section 9.10 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

      Section 9.11 Disclosure Letters. Matters reflected in the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited
to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in such Disclosure
Letters. Such additional matters may be set forth for informational purposes, do
not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature that are not required
to be reflected in such Disclosure Letters, and do not establish any standard or
definition of materiality. The Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter have been arranged in a manner that corresponds to the
Sections of this Agreement; provided, that a disclosure made in any section of
the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter that is sufficient
to reasonably inform the recipient of information required to be disclosed in
another section of such Disclosure Letter to avoid a misrepresentation under a
Section of this Agreement shall be deemed, for all purposes of this Agreement,
to have been made under the other section of such Disclosure Letter. The mere
listing in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter,
however, of a document or other item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an
exception to a representation or warranty made in this Agreement (unless the
representation or warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other
item itself or the mere listing of the document or item in such Disclosure
Letter otherwise reasonably informs the recipient of an exception to the
representation or warranty).

International Multifoods Corporation
110 Cheshire Lane, Suite 300

c/o The J. M. Smucker Company

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
March 7, 2004 (the "MERGER AGREEMENT"), between International Multifoods
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), MIX Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("MERGER SUB"), and The J. M. Smucker
Company, an Ohio Corporation ("PARENT"), the Company will merge with and into
the Merger Sub (the "MERGER"), with the Merger Sub as the surviving corporation.
As a result of the Merger, the undersigned may receive shares of common stock,
no par value per share, of Parent ("PARENT COMMON STOCK") in exchange for shares
owned by the undersigned of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the
Company (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK").

      The undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an
"AFFILIATE" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 ("RULE 145")
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "SECURITIES ACT") by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), although nothing contained
herein should be construed as an admission of such fact. If in fact the
undersigned is an affiliate of the Company under the Securities Act, the
undersigned's ability to sell, assign or transfer Parent Common Stock received
by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger may be restricted unless such transaction is
registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is
available. The undersigned understands that such exemptions are limited and the
undersigned has obtained or will obtain advice of counsel (which may be counsel
to Parent or the Company) as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions,
including information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such
securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act. The
undersigned understands that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock to be received
by the undersigned in the Merger or to take any other action necessary in order
to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

      The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Parent that the
undersigned will not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of
Parent Common Stock received by the




                                      A-1

<PAGE>

undersigned in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in connection with
the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule
145 or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to Parent or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter
from the Staff of the SEC specifically issued with respect to a transaction to
be engaged in by the undersigned, is not required to be registered under the
Securities Act.

      In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of the
shares of Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in the Merger pursuant
to Rule 145, the undersigned will supply Parent with evidence of compliance with
such Rule or the opinion of counsel or no-action letter referred to above. The
undersigned understands that Parent may instruct its transfer agent to withhold
the transfer of any shares of Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in
the Merger disposed of by the undersigned, but that (provided such transfer is
not prohibited by any other provision of this letter agreement) upon receipt of
such evidence of compliance, Parent shall cause the transfer agent to effectuate
the transfer of the shares of Parent Common Stock sold as indicated in such
letter.

      The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the legend set forth below
will be placed on certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
received by the undersigned in connection with the Merger or held by a
transferee thereof, which legend will be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates if: (i) the securities represented thereby have been registered for
sale by the undersigned under the Securities Act, (ii) Parent has received an
opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that the
restrictions imposed by Rule 145 no longer apply to the undersigned, (iii) the
undersigned is not an affiliate of Parent and one year shall have elapsed from
the date the undersigned acquired the securities in the Merger and the
provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then available to the undersigned, or (iv) the
undersigned is not, and has not then been for at least three months, an
affiliate of Parent and two years shall have elapsed from the date the
undersigned acquired the securities in the Merger and the provisions of Rule
145(d)(3) are then available to the undersigned.

      There will be placed on the certificates for Parent Common Stock issued to
the undersigned in connection with the Merger, or any substitutions therefor, a
legend stating in substance:

      "The shares represented by this certificate are issued in a
      transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
      of 1933 applies.  The shares may be sold, assigned, transferred or
      otherwise disposed of only in accordance with the terms of a
      letter dated ______________, 2004 between the registered holder
      hereof to The J. M. Smucker Company, a copy of which is on file at
      the principal offices of The J. M. Smucker Company."




                                      A-2

      The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read
this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed
upon the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock
received by the undersigned in the Merger and (ii) the receipt by Parent of this
letter is an inducement to Parent's obligations to consummate the Merger.

                                       Very truly yours,

                                       ________________________________________
