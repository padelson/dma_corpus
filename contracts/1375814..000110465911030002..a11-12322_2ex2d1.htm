agent but as a term of the merger contemplated by this Agreement and
accordingly such appointment is irrevocable by

 



      
 

 



 

action of any Securityholder. The appointment made hereunder shall not be
affected by the death, illness, dissolution, disability, incapacity or other
inability to act of the principal pursuant to any applicable Law. In its

further authorization or advice from the Securityholders on any matters
concerning this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, the
Securityholders Representative shall be entitled to seek such further
authorization from the Securityholders prior to acting on their behalf. In
such event, or in the event that a replacement Securityholders Representative
is required to be appointed pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)_ below, each
Securityholder shall have such number of votes as is equal to such
Securityholders Percentage Share and the authorization of a plurality of such
number of votes shall be binding on all of the Securityholders and shall
constitute the authorization of the Securityholders, except as may otherwise
be required by applicable Laws.

 



 

(c) Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation may conclusively and
absolutely rely upon any act of the Securityholders Representative with
respect to all matters referred to herein, including the execution and
delivery by the Securityholders Representative of any document executed, or
purported to be executed, on behalf of any of the Securityholders. Any
decision or action by the Securityholders Representative hereunder shall
constitute a decision or action of all of the Securityholders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each Securityholder, and no Securityholder
shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest
any such decision or action. Any notices required to be made or delivered to
the Securityholders hereunder or under any other Transaction Documents shall
be made or delivered to the Securityholders Representative for the benefit of
the applicable Securityholders and the making or delivering of such notice to
the Securityholders Representative shall discharge in full the applicable
notice requirement.

such resignation to Denham Commodity Partners Fund LP and Denham Commodity
Partners Fund LP, or an Affiliate thereof, may, in its sole discretion, serve
as the replacement Securityholders

 



      
 

 



 

Representative upon written notice to Parent. If there is a vacancy at any
time in the position of Securityholders Representative (including if Denham
Commodity Partners Fund LP, or an Affiliate thereof, declines to serve as
Securityholders Representative pursuant to the foregoing sentence within ten
(10) days following the resignation of Mx SR LLC as Securityholders
Representative), the Person last serving as Securityholders Representative
shall request from the Paying Agent a list of all Securityholders and the
addresses on file with the Paying Agent for such Securityholders and shall
deliver, within seven (7) Business Days of such Persons receipt of such
addresses, a notice to each such Securityholder at such address notifying the
Securityholders (i) that a vacancy in the position of Securityholders
Representative exists and (ii) to the extent any Securityholders have agreed
to be appointed Securityholders Representative, of the names of such
Securityholders. Following the delivery of such notice, the vacancy shall be
filled by a vote of the Securityholders in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_.
If at any time there is no Person acting as the Securityholders Representative
and the Securityholders fail to fill such vacancy within thirty (30) days
following the resignation of the then current Securityholders Representative,
Parent may appoint (with the consent of the Securityholder to be appointed the
Securityholders Representative) the Securityholders Representative from among
the Securityholders; _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that the Securityholders
Representative shall not be a trust; and _provided_ _further_ , that the
Percentage Share of the Securityholders Representative selected by Parent must
be greater than one percent as of the Closing Date. In the event that Parent
appoints a Securityholders Representative pursuant to the foregoing sentence
(and such Securityholder agrees to such appointment), the Securityholders may
revoke such appointment and appoint a replacement Securityholders
Representative at any time in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_. In no event
shall any Securityholder be obligated to accept an appointment by Parent to
serve as Securityholders Representative.

 



 

(e) The Securityholders Representative acknowledges that it has carefully read
and understands this Agreement and hereby accepts the appointment and
designation made hereunder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholders Representative shall not be
liable to Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Securityholders
in its capacity as Securityholders Representative for any error of judgment,
or any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good faith or for any
mistake in fact or Law, or for anything that it may do or refrain from doing
in connection with this Agreement, except for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Securityholders Representative shall not have any
duties or responsibilities other than those expressly set forth in this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Securityholders Representative Escrow
Agreement, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or shall otherwise exist against
the Securityholders Representative. The Securityholders Representative shall
be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in

 



      
 

 



 

relying, upon any statements furnished to it by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, any Securityholder, Parent or Merger Sub, or any other evidence
deemed by the Securityholders Representative to be reliable. The
Securityholders Representative may seek the advice of legal counsel in the
event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the
provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or its duties
hereunder or thereunder, and it shall incur no liability in its capacity as
Securityholders Representative to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Securityholder and shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken,
omitted or suffered by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel. The
Securityholders shall severally, based on each Securityholders Percentage
Share of the applicable liabilities, claims, actions, damages, losses and
expenses, indemnify and hold harmless and defend the Securityholders
Representative, its Affiliates and its Representatives against any and all
liabilities, claims, actions, damages, losses and expenses (including legal
and other professional fees and expenses and litigation costs) arising out of
or in connection with (i) the Securityholders Representatives acts or
omissions to act, resulting from, arising out of, incurred in connection with,
or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Securityholders Representative Escrow Agreement and (ii) actions or omissions
otherwise reasonably believed to be in the scope of the Securityholders
Representatives authority; _provided_ that, in each case, such actions or
omissions did not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 



 

(g) The Securityholders shall pay the Securityholders Representative an annual
fee of $100,000 through the date on which all of the funds in the Fixed Escrow
Account are finally disbursed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement for each year or any portion of a year it serves as
Securityholders Representative, which such fee shall be deducted from the
escrow account established pursuant to the terms of the Securityholders
Representative Escrow Agreement for compensation and reimbursement of the
Securityholders Representative (the " ** _Securityholders Representative
Escrow Account_** ") and shall be paid in advance on the Closing Date and on
each anniversary of the Closing Date. In addition to such annual fee, the
Securityholders shall reimburse the Securityholders Representative for any and
all costs, expenses and other liabilities incurred by the Securityholders
Representative in connection with the performance of its duties under this
Agreement and such costs and expenses shall be paid as a Transaction Cost if
incurred and ascertainable prior to Closing, and, thereafter, in accordance
with this _Section 2.4(g)_. The Securityholders Representative shall be
entitled to deduct any amounts from the Securityholders Representative Escrow
Account necessary to satisfy the indemnification and payment obligations of
the Securityholders pursuant to _Sections 2.4(f)-(g)_. If at any time there
are insufficient (or no) funds remaining in the Securityholders Representative
Escrow Account to pay such amounts, (A) the Securityholders Representative may
deduct any amount owing to it pursuant to _Sections 2.4(f)-(g)_, or any
amounts it reasonably believes may be payable to it in the future, from any
amounts that have been finally determined to be distributable to the
Securityholders from the Fixed Escrow Account or the Adjustment Escrow Account
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, and
(B) if no such amounts are to be distributed to the Securityholders, or if
such amounts are insufficient, the Securityholders shall reimburse the
Securityholders Representative based on each Securityholders Percentage Share
of such amounts owing

 



      
 

 



 

to the Securityholders Representative. The Securityholders Representative
shall have the right to deliver instructions to the Escrow Agent at any time
to disburse funds to the Securityholders Representative from the
Securityholders Representative Escrow Account or to withhold amounts that have
been finally determined to be distributable to the Securityholders from the
Fixed Escrow Account or the Adjustment Escrow Account in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement, without the necessity of
obtaining approval from any other Person (including any Securityholder);
_provided_ that such instructions comply with this _Section 2.4(g)_.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) with respect to any provision of this Agreement that requires Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to obtain the consent or approval of the
Securityholders Representative after the Closing Date, if the Securityholders
Representative fails to provide written notice of the Securityholders
Representatives consent or rejection within the later of (x) the time period
provided for in the applicable provisions of this Agreement and (y) fifteen
(15) Business Days after the date Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, requested such consent or approval, then the Securityholders
Representative shall be deemed to have rejected the request; and

 



 

(ii) if at anytime the Securityholders Representative shall have resigned and
no replacement Securityholders Representative shall have been designated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (after the expiration of the
applicable time periods set forth in _Section 2.4(d)_, regardless of whether
or not the Securityholders Representative has complied with, or taken the
actions required by, _Section 2.4(d)_):

 



 

(A) any requirement in this Agreement to deliver notice to the Securityholders
Representative shall be deemed to be satisfied upon providing notice, in
accordance with _Section 13.5,_ to each of the Securityholders at the
applicable addresses on file with the Paying Agent; and

 



 

(B) Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, may take any action
that is to be taken by the Securityholders Representative or that requires the
consent or approval of the Securityholders Representative pursuant to this
Agreement if (1) Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, delivers
written notice of its intention to take such action to each of the
Securityholders at the applicable addresses on file with the Paying Agent and
(2) within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of the mailing of such
written notice, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, does not
receive written notice from a

 



      
 

 



 

replacement Securityholders Representative appointed in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement objecting to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, taking such action; _provided_ , that, if Parents or the
Surviving Corporations inability to take the applicable action prior to the
delivery of notice to the Securityholders or the expiration of such fifteen-
Business Day period would materially prejudice the rights of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, may, in good faith, take such action and thereafter shall deliver
prompt written notice thereof to the Securityholders.

5.4 _Mechanics of Payments_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with
Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, or such other Person reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
F_ (or in such other form as may be reasonably acceptable to both the Company
and Parent) (the " ** _Paying Agent Agreement_** "), to act as paying agent
for the Securityholders in connection with the Merger (the " ** _Paying
Agent_** ") and to receive (i) for the benefit of the Stockholders, the Merger
Consideration and (ii) for the benefit of the Securityholders, any amounts
payable to the Securityholders upon release of funds pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement and the Securityholders Representative Escrow Agreement. Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time. The
Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its
disbursement to the Stockholders, be invested by the Paying Agent as provided
in the Paying Agent Agreement. Any amounts in excess of the Merger
Consideration, including any interest or other income resulting from such
investments, shall be paid to Parent or Merger Sub upon termination of the
paying agency arrangements under the Paying Agent Agreement and shall be the
property of Parent or Merger Sub. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
Parent shall promptly replace funds deposited with the Paying Agent (by Parent
or the Escrow Agent) in the event of any loss of such funds as a result of the
investment of such funds. Subject to the last sentence of this _Section
5.4(a)_ and the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall be deemed for all
purposes of this Agreement to have satisfied its obligation to pay the Merger
Consideration to the Stockholders hereunder at the Closing upon the Paying
Agents receipt of the Merger Consideration, it being expressly agreed that
Parents payment of the Merger Consideration to the Paying Agent shall forever
and irrevocably be deemed to constitute payment to each and every Stockholder
(other than with respect to Dissenting Shares) the full amount of the portion
of the Merger Consideration which is owed to such Stockholder under this
Agreement at the Closing. In the event the Merger Consideration is paid to the
Paying Agent and the Paying Agent fails to pay the full amount of the portion
of the Merger Consideration which is owed to any Stockholder under this
Agreement, such Stockholders sole and exclusive remedy shall be the right to

 



      
 

 



 

be subrogated to Parents rights under the Paying Agent Agreement.
Notwithstanding the deposit of the Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent,
Parent shall continue to have the obligation to pay the remaining portion of
the Common Share Price, if any, due and owing to the Securityholders
hereunder, which obligation shall be deemed to have been satisfied by the
deposit by Parent of the Fixed Escrow Amount, the Securityholders
Representative Escrow Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount with the Escrow
Agent on or prior to the Closing Date (subject to the obligations set forth in
the fifth sentence of this _Section 5.4(a)_ ) and Parents compliance with the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement with respect
to distributions of any portions of the Fixed Escrow Amount and the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, if any, to the Paying Agent thereunder, it being expressly
agreed that (subject to the obligations set forth in the fifth sentence of
this _Section 5.4(a)_ ) Parents deposit of the Fixed Escrow Amount, the
Securityholders Representative Escrow Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount
with the Escrow Agent on or prior to the Closing Date and Parents and the
Surviving Corporations compliance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement and this Agreement with respect to distributions of the Fixed Escrow
Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount, if any, to the Paying Agent, and
Parents and the Surviving Corporations compliance with the Paying Agent
Agreement, shall forever and irrevocably be deemed to constitute payment to
each and every Securityholder (other than with respect to Dissenting Shares)
of the full amount of the remaining portion of the Common Share Price, if any,
that is owed to the Securityholders hereunder.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than two (2) Business Days following the Closing Date, the
Paying Agent shall mail to each Stockholder of record as of the Effective Time
whose shares of Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
Common Share Price pursuant to _Section 4.1_, a letter of transmittal in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (or such other form as may be reasonably
acceptable to each of the Company, Parent and the Paying Agent) (a " **
_Letter of Transmittal_** "), which shall include instructions for effecting
the surrender of the certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding Common Stock (including Restricted Shares) (the "
** _Certificates_** "), in exchange for payment of the portion of the Merger
Consideration to which each Stockholder may be entitled, and shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss shall pass, only upon proper
delivery to the Paying Agent of the Certificates ( _provided_ , that the
Company shall deliver any Certificates representing Restricted Shares held by
the Company on behalf of the applicable Restricted Holder to such Restricted
Holder prior to the Effective Time, or at such Restricted Holders direction,
to the Paying Agent). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide
to each RSU Holder whose Company Restricted Share Units were converted into
the right to receive the Common Share Price pursuant to _Section 4.1_, a
Company Restricted Share Unit surrender agreement in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit H_ (or in such other form as may be reasonably acceptable to each
of the Company, Parent and the Paying Agent) (a " ** _Surrender Agreement_**
"), which shall contain an acknowledgement of surrender and such other terms
as Parent may reasonably specify. Upon delivery of a duly completed and
validly executed Surrender Agreement to the Company and Parent, the applicable
RSU Holder executing such Surrender Agreement shall be entitled to receive the
Closing Common Share Price (less the applicable Tax withholdings pursuant

 



      
 

 



 

to _Section 4.1(d)_), at the Closing in exchange for such RSU Holders
Company Restricted Share Units and such Company Restricted Share Units shall
forthwith be cancelled. Upon delivery of a Surrender Agreement to the Paying
Agent, the applicable RSU Holder executing such Surrender Agreement shall be
entitled to receive any remaining portion of the Common Share Price (less
applicable federal, state and local income Tax withholding and Social
Security, Medicare, state disability, unemployment and other withholding
obligations) in respect of the Company Restricted Share Units held by such RSU
Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time as may become payable pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
amounts set forth in _Section 4.1_ and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Company Restricted Share
Units. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name a surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect that transfer and (y) the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct any applicable Taxes from the payments made
to such Person, unless the Person requesting such payment shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Each Certificate and each
Company Restricted Share Unit shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender in accordance with
this _Section 5.4_, the payments set forth in _Section 4.1_. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any cash payable to Securityholders pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article V_ , except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond pursuant
to and in accordance with the Letter of Transmittal, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall pay the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration to be paid
in respect of the Common Stock formerly represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate.

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Securityholders shall cease to have
any rights with respect to the Common Stock or Company Restricted Share Units,
except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

 



 

(e) At any time following the termination of the Escrow Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest earned thereon) that had been made available to the Paying Agent
for disbursement to Securityholders who have not, prior to such date,
surrendered their Company Restricted Share Units or Certificates as required
by the Letter of Transmittal, and thereafter such Securityholders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors

 



      
 

 



 

thereof with respect to any amounts that may be payable to such
Securityholders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any Securityholder for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(f) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or to direct the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from any
amount payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall determine in good faith it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other Law relating to Taxes unless the applicable Securityholder shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paying Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of whom such withholding was made by the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
responsible to pay, in due course, all applicable federal, state and local
income Tax withholding and Social Security, Medicare, state disability,
unemployment and other obligations for which amounts were withheld in respect
of payments to the RSU Holders and payments of Change in Control Costs or
otherwise withheld from payments made under this Agreement.

 



 

5.5 _Dissenters  Rights_.

 



 

(a) In connection and included with the mailing of the Consent Solicitation,
the Company shall provide each record holder of Common Stock with notice of
such holders appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The
Company shall give Parent reasonably prompt notice (and in any event, no later
than three (3) Business Days after receipt) of any demands for appraisal
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company from any
Stockholders, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in connection therewith. No
later than ten (10) days following the Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall provide notice of the Closing Date to each Stockholder
entitled to appraisal, in accordance with Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
outstanding shares of Common Stock that are held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by Persons who have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who have demanded and perfected the right, if
any, for appraisal of such outstanding shares of Common Stock in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and have not withdrawn or lost
such right to appraisal (collectively, the " ** _Dissenting Shares_** ") shall
be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of the DGCL. If a holder of Dissenting Shares thereafter
withdraws or loses (through

 



      
 

 



 

failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal with respect to such
Dissenting Shares, then, as of the occurrence of such withdrawal or loss, each
such Dissenting Share shall be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective
Time, into and represent only the right to receive, in accordance with
_Section 4.1_, the Common Share Price and other consideration described in
this Agreement, without interest thereon, except as expressly provided herein.

 



 

5.6 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall prepare a statement
(the " ** _Post-Closing Statement_** ") which shall contain or include (x) a
reasonably detailed calculation of the Net Working Capital and (y)
calculations of (i) the Approved Capital Expenditures, (ii) the NOL Tax
Benefit, (iii) the Transaction Costs, (iv) the Change in Control Costs, (v)
the aggregate amount of outstanding Debt of the Company Entities as of the
Closing Time, and (vi) the estimated Final Adjustment Amount, and the
Surviving Corporation shall deliver the same, together with the Closing
Financial Statements, to the Securityholders Representative no later than the
45th day following the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall have until the 60th day following the Closing Date
to deliver the calculation of the NOL Tax Benefit to the Securityholders
Representative, and, when delivered, such calculation of the NOL Tax Benefit
shall be deemed part of the Post-Closing Statement.

 



 

(b) The Post-Closing Statement delivered by the Surviving Corporation to the
Securityholders Representative shall be final and binding on the Parties, the
Securityholders and the Securityholders Representative unless the
Securityholders Representative objects within forty-five (45) days after
receipt of the full Post-Closing Statement, including the calculation of the
NOL Tax Benefit, by: (A) notifying the Surviving Corporation and Parent in
writing of each objection thereto; and (B) delivering to the Surviving
Corporation and Parent a statement describing the basis for each objection
along with any modifications to the Post-Closing Statement proposed by the
Securityholders Representative. The modified Post-Closing Statement as
proposed by the Securityholders Representative shall be final and binding on
the Parties, the Securityholders Representative and the Securityholders unless
the Surviving Corporation objects in writing no later than the fifteenth
(15th) day following the receipt of such modified Post-Closing Statement,
which such notice to the Securityholders Representative shall contain a
detailed statement describing the basis of each objection thereto and any
modifications proposed by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) Any component of the Surviving Corporations Post-Closing Statement or the
Securityholders Representatives modified Post-Closing Statement that is not
the subject of a proper and timely objection by the Surviving Corporation or
the Securityholders Representative, as applicable, shall be final and binding
on the Parties, the Securityholders and the Securityholders Representative. If
the items disputed pursuant to _Section 5.6(b)_ equal an aggregate amount in
dispute that is less than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, then the aggregate
amount so disputed shall be retained in the Adjustment Escrow Account and the
Securityholders Representative and Parent shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent directing that the remaining

 



      
 

 



 

portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount be distributed to the Securityholders
or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, as to the extent owing to such
Persons pursuant to _Section 5.6(g)_.

 



 

(d) Following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall permit the
Securityholders Representative and its counsel, accountants and other advisors

records of the Surviving Corporation and the applicable workpapers of its
accountants for the purposes of the review and objection right contemplated
herein.

 



 

(e) The Surviving Corporation and the Securityholders Representative shall use
reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute arising under _Section 5.6(b)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if they fail to resolve any dispute within
thirty (30) days following the Surviving Corporations notice to the
Securityholders Representative that it objects to the Securityholders
Representatives modifications to the Post-Closing Statement, then such
disagreement shall be submitted for resolution to Grant Thornton LLP or such
other firm of independent accountants to which the Surviving Corporation and
the Securityholders Representative agree in writing (the " ** _Independent
Accountants_** "). If issues are submitted to the Independent Accountants for
resolution, the Securityholders Representative and the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly enter into a customary engagement letter with the Independent
Accountants. Within fifteen (15) days after the Independent Accountants have
been retained, each of the Securityholders Representative and the Surviving
Corporation shall furnish to the Independent Accountants and each other a
written statement of its position with respect to each matter in dispute.
Within ten (10) Business Days after the expiration of such 15-day period, the
Securityholders Representative and the Surviving Corporation may deliver to
the Independent Accountants and to each other their respective responses to
the others position on each matter in dispute. With each submission, the
Securityholders Representative and the Surviving Corporation may also furnish
to the Independent Accountants such other information and documents as they
deem relevant or such information and documents as may be requested by the
Independent Accountants with appropriate copies or notification being given to
the other. The Independent Accountants may, at their discretion, conduct a
conference concerning the disputed matter(s) with the Securityholders
Representative and the Surviving Corporation ( _provided_ that the Independent
Accountants shall not conduct any substantive meetings or other communications
with either of the Securityholders Representative or the Surviving Corporation
outside the presence of the other), at which conference the Securityholders
Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall each have the right to
present additional documents, materials and other information and to have
present its advisors, counsel and accountants. Each of the Securityholders
Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall provide copies to the other
Person of any and all materials provided to the Independent Accountants. All
communications from the Independent Accountants to either of the Surviving
Corporation or the Securityholders Representative, whether oral or in writing,
shall be provided promptly to the other Person.

 



 

(f) The Independent Accountants shall be directed to promptly, and in any
event within forty (40) days after their appointment pursuant to _Section
5.6(e)_, render

 



      
 

 



 

their decision on the disputed matter(s). The Independent Accountants
determination as to each matter in dispute shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to the Securityholders Representative and the Surviving
Corporation and shall be final and binding on the Parties, the Securityholders
Representative and the Securityholders. The fees of the Independent
Accountants shall be borne solely by the Surviving Corporation or the
Securityholders Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) based on
which Persons calculations of the disputed matters (determined on an
aggregate basis) as submitted to the Independent Accountants varied the most
from the final calculations of the Independent Accountants.

Expenditures_** "), if any; (iii) the NOL Tax Benefit (as so finally
determined, the " ** _Final NOL Tax Benefit_** "); (iv) the aggregate amount
of outstanding Debt of the Company Entities as of the Closing Time (as so
finally determined, the " ** _Final Debt_** "); (v) the aggregate amount of
Transaction Costs (as so finally determined, the " ** _Final Transaction
Costs_** "); and (vi) the aggregate amount of Change in Control Costs (as so
finally determined, the " ** _Final Change in Control Costs_** "), in each
case in accordance with _Sections 5.6(a)_, _5.6(b)_ , _5.6(c)_ , _5.6(e)_
and/or _5.6(f)_ , as applicable, then:

 



 

(i) if the Final Adjustment Amount is a positive number:

 



 

(A) Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall promptly provide a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly the
aggregate amount of the Adjustment Escrow Amount remaining in the Adjustment
Escrow Account after any distribution, if any, required by _Section 5.6(c)_,
_plus_ any interest accrued thereon, to the Paying Agent for distribution to
the Securityholders (subject to compliance with _Section 5.4_), pro rata in
accordance with their Percentage Share; and

 



 

(B) the Surviving Corporation shall pay, or cause to be paid to the Paying
Agent for distribution to the Securityholders (subject to compliance with
_Section 5.4_), pro rata in accordance with their Percentage Share, the
amount, if any, by which the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, _plus_ interest on such amount from the Closing Date through
the date on which payment is made to the Paying Agent at the Applicable Rate;

 



 

(ii) if the Final Adjustment Amount is a negative number, Parent and the
Securityholders Representative shall promptly provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent directing disbursement from the Adjustment
Escrow Amount (and to the extent the

 



      
 

 



 

Adjustment Escrow Amount is insufficient, also from the Fixed Escrow Amount as
referenced below) as follows:

 



 

(A) to the Surviving Corporation an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the
absolute value of the Final Adjustment Amount and (y) the sum of (I) the
aggregate Adjustment Escrow Amount _plus_ (II) the General Indemnity Escrow,
plus (in the case of clause (x) or (y) as applicable) any interest accrued
thereon; and

 



 

(B) to the Paying Agent, for distribution to the Securityholders (subject to
compliance with _Section 5.4_) pro rata in accordance with their Percentage
Share, the remainder of the Adjustment Escrow Amount in the Adjustment Escrow
Account, if any, plus any interest accrued thereon, following the disbursement
set forth in the foregoing clause (A).

 



 

(h) For purposes of clarity, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be entitled to any payments pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ in
excess of the sum of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and General Indemnity Escrow
(plus any interest accrued thereon).

 



 

5.7 _No Duplicative Effect_. The provisions of this _Article V_ and of any
other Transaction Document shall apply in such a manner so as not to give the
components and calculations duplicative effect to any item of adjustment and
no amount shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or in part
(either as an increase or reduction) more than once in the calculation of
(including any component of) Net Working Capital or any other calculated
amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion
(either as an increase or reduction) would be to cause such amount to be
overstated or understated for purposes of such calculation.

 



 

5.8 _Accrued Vacation_. At the Closing, the Company shall cause to be paid all
accrued vacation with respect to Employees of any Company Entity (including
any Employee on a leave of absence) that is earned and unused immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

threatened against Parent, Merger Sub or their respective directors or

would restrain, enjoin, prohibit or otherwise make illegal the consummation of
the Merger.

 



 

8.4 _No Brokers or Finders_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub have retained,
employed, or used any broker or finder in connection with the Merger.

to the matters specifically described on _Schedule N_ or in _Sections

warranties that the Company or anyone purporting to represent the Company gave
or might have given, or which might be provided or implied by applicable Law
or commercial practice, with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries, are
hereby expressly excluded. Parent acknowledges that neither the Company nor
any other Person on the Companys behalf has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not expressly set forth in _Article VII_ or the
Company Closing Certificate, and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to
any liability or indemnification obligation to Parent or any other Person
resulting from the distribution in written or oral communication to Parent, or
use by Parent of, any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other
material made available to Parent in the electronic data room (except to the
extent that the Company has made a representation or

 



      
 

 



 

warranty in _Article VII_ that it has provided or made available to Parent
true and complete copies of any such materials), confidential information
memoranda, management interviews and presentations or otherwise in expectation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Closing, access to (in each case, that is not subject to any condition or
contingency) the financial resources to consummate the Merger and to make all
payments required to be made by Parent or Merger Sub under the Transaction
Documents.

(a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other in making all
filings with respect to, and obtaining the Mandatory Consents and Antitrust
Approvals and making any other filings with Governmental Authorities as may be
necessary in connection with the Merger. Except with respect to filings being
made pursuant to the HSR Act, any other Antitrust Laws or the Schedule M
Filings, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly provide drafts to the
other, allow reasonably adequate time for comment by the other and consult
promptly with the other with respect to the contents of all notifications,
filings, submissions, further documentation and evidence to be submitted to
all relevant Governmental Authorities, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws. Parent and the Company shall: (i) furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may require in connection
with its preparation of any notification, filing, submission or further
documentation or evidence that is necessary in making any filing to, or
obtaining any consent from, any Governmental Authority; and (ii) to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws, promptly disclose to the other all
correspondence received from or sent to any relevant Governmental Authority in

related communication in whatever form with any relevant Governmental
Authority.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall make all appropriate filings necessary to
obtain the Mandatory Consents and Antitrust Approvals, including filings
pursuant to the HSR Act and any applicable Antitrust Laws and the Federal
Power Act, in each case with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable but (i) with respect to the filings pursuant
to the HSR Act, any applicable Antitrust Laws, the Federal Power Act and the
Georgia Public Service Commission rules and regulations (as described in item
4 of _Disclosure Schedule 7.2(a)_ in no event later than seven (7) Business
Days after the date hereof, and (ii) with respect to the other notice filings
set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 7.2(c)_ that are required to be made prior

supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Laws, the Federal
Power Act and any other applicable Laws. Without limitation of the foregoing,
no Party or any of its respective Affiliates shall enter into any agreement
with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the Merger,

 



      
 

 



 

except with the prior written consent of the other Parties. Subject to
_Section 9.1(c)_, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the Mandatory Consents and early termination of the applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws, as applicable,
and, to the extent available, under any other Laws relating to Mandatory

9.6_ and _12.1(c)_ ), nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates to dispose of any of their
assets or to limit their ability to conduct or operate any of their businesses
or to consent to any disposition of assets or limits on their ability to
conduct or operate any of such businesses, whether prior to or after the
Effective Time, or to commit or agree to any of the foregoing, to obtain any
consents, approvals, Permits or authorizations or to remove any impediments to
the Merger relating to Antitrust Laws or to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order
in any Proceeding relating to any Antitrust Laws. In addition, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
_Section 9.1_ shall require any Party to disclose to any other Party
confidential information about third parties in connection with seeking
approvals from Governmental Authorities to the extent that such disclosures
would constitute violations of contractual obligations or legal duties;
_provided_ that, to the extent reasonably practicable, the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent or approval of any such
third parties to permit any such disclosures.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 9.1(c)_, if any Proceeding is instituted (or
threatened), challenging the Merger as in violation of any Antitrust Laws, or
if any Order is entered, enforced or attempted to be entered or enforced, by a
court or other Governmental Authority, which Order would make the Merger
illegal or would otherwise prohibit, prevent, restrict, impair or delay
consummation of the Merger, each of Parent and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or
Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any such
decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Merger and to have such decree, judgment, injunction or
other Order repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit
consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(e) The Company shall make the filings (in a form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent) described on _Schedule M_ (the " ** _Schedule M

unless, subsequent to the meetings with the appropriate members of the FERC
staff as described below in this _Section 9.1(e)_ , in the opinion of the
Company after consultation with Parent, a delay in the actual filings to
consider the effect thereon of ongoing discussion with appropriate members of
the FERC staff is deemed to be advisable, but in no event, later than the
Closing Date. Prior to the submission of the Schedule M Filings, the Company
and Parent shall attend a meeting with the appropriate member of FERC staff to
discuss the Schedule M Filings. Such a meeting shall be scheduled by the
Company at a time mutually convenient to the Company and Parent but in no
event later than seven (7) days after the date hereof;

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that if FERC staff is not available within seven (7)
days, the meeting shall occur as soon as practicable thereafter, but in any
event prior to Closing. Prior to the meeting with FERC staff, the Company
shall promptly provide drafts of the Schedule M Filings to Parent and allow
reasonably adequate time for comment by Parent. The Company shall consult
promptly with Parent with respect to the contents of all notifications,
filings, submissions, further documentation and evidence to be submitted to
FERC, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws. Subsequent to the submission
of the Schedule M Filings, the Company and Parent shall each be entitled to
participate in any meetings, discussions, or settlement conferences with FERC
staff arising from FERC staffs review and consideration of the Schedule M
Filings; _provided_ that Parent shall in no way take positions that are
adverse to the Company. The Company shall be responsible for the submission of
any amendments or supplements to the Schedule M Filings or any pleadings or
other documentation in connection with matters covered by the Schedule M
Filings and shall carry out its responsibilities in an active and diligent
manner. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
comment prior to submitting any such documents to FERC. Parent may, but shall
not be required to, submit pleadings or other documentation to FERC on its own
behalf and shall provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to comment
prior to submitting any such documents to FERC; _provided_ that Parent shall
not submit comments that are adverse the positions of the Company. Following
the execution of this Agreement and to the extent the matters addressed in the
Schedule M Filings have not been fully and finally resolved prior to the
Closing Date, the prosecution and administration of the Schedule M Filings
shall be conducted in accordance with _Schedule Q_.

Laws; and (iii) the right to share such information among themselves solely
for the purposes of this Agreement (in each case, except to the extent
necessary to protect

constitute a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) Parent notifies the Company in
writing that it has determined that a Material Adverse Effect has occurred
and, in either case, Parent elects (in its sole discretion) in a written
notice to the Company to waive the conditions set forth in _Section

Time; _provided_ , ___however_ , that Parent or an Affiliate of Parent will
cause a tax-qualified Savings Plan of Parent to accept rollovers, including
rollovers of loans, from any Savings Plan of the Company Entities with respect
to Continuing Employees to the extent permitted under such Parent Savings
Plan. The Company will provide Parent with evidence that the Savings Plans and
such other Employee Benefit Plans have been terminated in accordance with this
_Section 9.8(a)_ pursuant to resolution of the Board (the form and substance
of which will be subject to review and approval by Parent, such approval not

immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Parent and the Company, the Company
Entities shall terminate, as of the day immediately prior to the Closing, each
officer or employee set forth on _Schedule B_. Parent shall take such action
as may be necessary so that on and after the Effective Time officers and
employees of the Company Entities who are in the employ of the Company
Entities immediately prior to the Closing (" ** _Continuing Employees_** ")
are provided, for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
with (i) employee benefits, plans and programs on substantially the same basis
as officers and employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries having similar
responsibilities and positions (" ** _Parent Benefit Plans_** ") and (ii)
annual cash compensation (including annual rate of cash base salary and wage
rates, as applicable, and target cash incentive opportunities) that are no
less favorable than such annual cash compensation levels maintained for and
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing. For
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, but not for benefit
accrual purposes or for purposes of benefits under any defined benefit pension
plan, in all Parent Benefit Plans, the Continuing Employees shall be credited
with their years of service with the Company Entities and any predecessors
thereof to the extent service with Parent and its Subsidiaries and any
predecessors thereof is taken into account under such Parent Benefit Plans,
except where the recognition of such service would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service. The eligibility of any
Continuing Employee to participate in any Parent Benefit Plan that is a
welfare benefit plan or program shall not be subject to any exclusions for any
pre-existing conditions if such individual has met the participation
requirements of similar benefit plans and programs of the Company Entities
subject, in the case of any insured arrangement, to the approval and agreement
of the applicable insurer. Any amounts previously expended by Continuing
Employees and their covered dependents under an Employee Benefit Plan for the
plan year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying out-of-pocket
requirements, deductibles and co-payments under any Employee Benefit Plan that
is a welfare benefit plan or program for the benefit of any employee of any
Company Entity shall be credited for purposes of satisfying such employees
out-of-pocket requirements, deductibles and co-payments under any comparable
Parent Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Continuing Employees
shall be responsible for providing the necessary

 



      
 

 



 

information to Parent based on "explanation of the benefits" forms received by
the Continuing Employee from the Employee Benefit Plans maintained by the
Company Entities. All individuals eligible to participate in any Company plan
or arrangement contemplated above shall be immediately eligible to participate
in the similar Parent Benefit Plan subject to the applicable terms and
conditions of any such plan. Nothing contained in this _Section 9.8(b)_ shall
create any rights in any Continuing Employee or former officer or employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company Entities or
the Surviving Corporation in respect of continued employment for any specified
period of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 



 

(c) Parent, Merger Sub and each Company Entity hereby agree that none of the
provisions of this _Section 9.8_ is intended to, and does not, confer upon
any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including
the right to enforce any obligations of Parent or the Merger Sub contained
herein. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall be construed to
prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from: (i) terminating, or modifying
the terms of employment of, any Continuing Employee following the Closing
Date; or (ii) terminating or modifying to any extent any Employee Benefit
Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may establish
or maintain. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an amendment to
any Employee Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or any other compensation and
benefit plans maintained for or provided to directors, officers or employees
of Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Company Entities prior to or following the
Closing Date.

 



 

9.9 _Tax Treatment_. The Parties agree that for federal and state income Tax
purposes they shall treat the Merger as a sale of the Common Stock by the
Stockholders to Parent.

 



 

9.10 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_. The Surviving Corporation shall
prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing Date for all Pre-Closing
Periods and all Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with past practice except to the extent otherwise required by
applicable Law. Reasonably in advance of filing, which for purposes of income
Tax Returns shall be no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing any such Tax Return, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver a copy of
such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and workpapers, to
the Securityholders Representative for its review and reasonable comment. The
Surviving Corporation shall cause such Tax Return (as revised to incorporate
the Securityholders Representatives reasonable comments) to be timely filed
and shall provide a copy to the Securityholders Representative.

 



 

(b) _Proration of Straddle Period Taxes_. In the case of Taxes that are
payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes
that is attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date
shall be:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either: (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts; or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax period of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (and each partnership in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a partner) ended with (and included) the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period;

 



 

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Company or any Subsidiary, deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period; and

 



 

(iii) any franchise Tax shall be allocated to the period during which the
income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is
measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for another period is
obtained by payment of such franchise Tax.

 



 

(c) _Tax Refunds; Contests and Amendments_.

 



 

(i) The Surviving Corporation and the Securityholders Representative agree
that any Tax refunds and interest thereon payable to the Company with respect
to any Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the
account of the Securityholders (other than any refund (A) resulting from the
carryback or carryforward of a net operating loss, (B) reflected in the
calculation of Net Working Capital, or (C) resulting from any other Tax
attribute from a period beginning after the Closing Date to a period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date, which refund shall be for the account of the
Surviving Corporation). The amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Company for
any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date shall be for the account of
the Surviving Corporation. The amount of any refund of Taxes of the Company
for any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between the
Securityholders and the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the
principles set forth in _Section 9.10(b)_. Within thirty (30) days after
receipt of each such federal, state or local income Tax refund,

 



      
 

 



 

the Surviving Corporation shall pay to the Securityholders an amount equal to
any refund and interest thereon the Securityholders are entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Section 9.10(c)_, net of reasonable costs or expenses
incurred by the Surviving Corporation in procuring such refund (and any such
payments to the Securityholders shall be made pro rata in accordance with
their Percentage Share); _provided_ , ___however_ , in the event there are
Seller Taxes that have not been recovered pursuant to the terms of _Article
XI_, and there are not sufficient funds in the Fixed Escrow Account to pay
such Seller Taxes, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to retain such
refund to the extent of such unrecovered Seller Taxes.

 



 

(ii) The Securityholders Representative shall have the right to control the
conduct and settlement of, and represent the Surviving Corporations interest
in, any Tax Proceeding relating to taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date, and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose. The
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to participate in such Tax
Proceeding at its own expense, and shall be entitled to control the
disposition of any issue involved in such Tax Proceeding that does not relate
to or affect a Seller Tax and that is not otherwise subject to indemnification
by the Securityholders hereunder. The Securityholders Representative and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to represent their own interests in
light of their responsibilities (including indemnity obligations) for Taxes,
at their own expense, in any Tax Proceeding involving a taxable period that
includes but does not end on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 9.10_, neither the Securityholders Representative
nor the Surviving Corporation shall agree to any settlement with respect to
any Tax Proceeding of the Surviving Corporation without the consent of the
other Person if such settlement could reasonably be expected to affect,
respectively, any Tax liability of the Securityholders or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, that is not an indemnified Tax.

 



 

(iii) Unless required by applicable Law or except as set forth below, the
Surviving Corporation shall not amend any Tax Return or election made in
connection with such Tax Return for any Tax Period ending on or before the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Securityholders
Representative. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to not, request that any tax examination be
initiated with respect to any of the matters set forth on _Schedule N_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation may file or cause to
be filed an amended Tax Return even if not required by applicable Law without
the consent of the Securityholders

 



      
 

 



 

Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that any additional Taxes resulting
therefrom shall not constitute Seller Taxes and no indemnification may be
asserted under _Article XI_ with respect to any such additional Taxes

 



 

(iv) If all or any portion of a refund to which the Securityholders are
entitled and have received payment of pursuant to this _Section 9.10(c)_ is
required to be repaid or otherwise disallowed by any Taxing Authority, the
amount of such refund required to be repaid or disallowed shall constitute a
Parent Indemnifiable Loss.

 



 

(d) _Tax Cooperation_. The Surviving Corporation and the Securityholders
Representative shall reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with
the preparation of Tax Returns related to the Surviving Corporation and any
audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes imposed on the
Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation shall preserve all
information and Records relating to any liabilities for Taxes with respect to
a Tax Period until the later of the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitation and extensions thereof or a final determination with respect to
Taxes for such period and shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any Record
without first providing the other Person a reasonable opportunity to review
and copy the same. The Surviving Corporation shall permit the Securityholders
Representative and its counsel, accountants and other advisors reasonable
access (with the right to make copies) to the financial books and records of
the Surviving Corporation and its counsel, accountants and other advisors (and
their workpapers) for the purposes of this _Section 9.10_. The
Securityholders Representative agrees, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on the Surviving Corporation
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All state and local transfer, sales, use, stamp,
registration or other similar Taxes (the " ** _Transfer Taxes_** ") resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne 50% by the
Securityholders (and such 50% shall be considered Transaction Costs, to the
extent determinable as of the Closing Time, or Seller Taxes, to the extent not
determinable as of, or otherwise paid at, the Closing Time) and 50% by Parent.

 



 

9.11 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly permitted pursuant to _Section 9.11(b)_ and _Section
9.11(c)_, the Company shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, entertain or knowingly encourage (including by way of providing
information) the submission or announcement of any inquiries, proposals or
offers that constitute or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover
Proposal; (ii) provide any non-public information concerning the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any Person or group who would reasonably be
expected to make any actual or proposed Takeover Proposal; (iii) engage

 



      
 

 



 

in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any Takeover Proposal; (iv)
approve, support, adopt, endorse or recommend any Takeover Proposal; or (v)
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate
any such inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations. Except as
expressly permitted pursuant to _Section 9.11(b)_ and _Section 9.11(c)_, the
Board shall not directly or indirectly (A) fail to make, withdraw, change,
modify or condition, in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation by the
Board that the Securityholders adopt this Agreement (the " ** _Company
Recommendation_** "), (B) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve, endorse or recommend, to the Securityholders a Takeover Proposal
or Superior Proposal or (C) fail to recommend against a tender or exchange
offer related to a Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal in any position
taken pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act (any such action referred
to in clauses (A)-(C) above, a " ** _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_**
").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
9.11_, if at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Consent, the Company
or any of its Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal that was made or
renewed after the date of this Agreement and did not result from or arise in
connection with any breach of _Section 9.11(a)_ and the Board (or a duly
constituted committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take any of the following actions would be inconsistent with the
Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then (i) the Company and its
Representatives may provide information (including non-public information) to
the applicable Bidder or provide access to the books, assets and personnel of
the Company, and (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations with such
Bidder and its Representatives; _provided_ that the Company shall only permit
non-public information related to the Company to be provided pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and, _provided_ _further_ , that the
Company shall (A) deliver written notice to Parent no later than one (1) day
after taking any action permitted pursuant to this _Section 9.11(b)_ and, to
the extent not previously delivered pursuant to _Section 9.11(d)_, deliver a
copy (or, if not in writing, an accurate written summary and description,
including all material terms and information conveyed pursuant thereto) of the
Takeover Proposal and any other materials, communication or information
received by the Company or any of its Representatives (whether written or
oral) in connection with or pursuant to such Takeover Proposal to Parent; (B)
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of providing such non-public
information to the Bidder) provide to Parent any such non-public information
that was not previously provided or made available to Parent; (C) within 24
hours of the Boards (or a duly constituted committee thereof), the Companys
or any of its Representatives receipt thereof, deliver a copy of (or, if not
in writing, an accurate written summary and description, including all
material terms and information conveyed pursuant thereto) any revisions,
amendments, supplements or modifications to the Takeover Proposal or an
updated Takeover Proposal and any other additional material documents,
communications or information received by the Board (or a duly constituted
committee thereof), the Company or any of its Representatives (whether written
or oral) in connection with or pursuant to such Takeover Proposal; and (D)
shall keep Parent reasonably informed orally and in writing as to the status
of any material developments concerning the Takeover Proposal,

 



      
 

 



 

including prompt written notice to Parent of any determination by the Board
(or a duly constituted committee thereof) that a Superior Proposal has been
made.

 



 

(c) If the Board (or a duly constituted committee thereof) determines in its
good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to take any of the following actions would be
inconsistent with the Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then, (i)
the Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) the Company
may waive, modify, amend or release any standstill or similar provisions with
respect to such Superior Proposal and (iii) the Company or its Subsidiaries
may enter into a definitive agreement to consummate such Superior Proposal if
the Company shall have, concurrently with entering into such agreement,
terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1(e)_; _provided_ , that
during the two Business Day-notice period referred to in _Section 9.11(d)_,
the Company shall (I) be prohibited from taking any of the actions set forth
in clauses (i)  (iii), and (II) have negotiated in good faith with Parent and
Merger Sub (to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to permit
Parent and Merger Sub to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (as adjusted, a " ** _Matching Bid_** ") as may be necessary to make
the Merger contemplated under such Matching Bid equivalent to, or better than,
the Superior Proposal.

 



 

(d) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day
after receipt thereof) notify Parent in writing in the event the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives receives a
Takeover Proposal, any request for non-public information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any Person who would reasonably be
expected to make a Takeover Proposal, or any request for discussions or
negotiations related to any Takeover Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal
(including any material changes related to the foregoing). Such notice shall
include the identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal or request
and the material terms and conditions thereof (including, if applicable,
copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements). The Company shall provide Parent at least two (2) Business Days
prior written notice that the Board intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, which such notice shall include copies of all proposed
definitive agreements with respect to the Superior Proposal.

 



 

(e) Except as expressly permitted pursuant to this _Section 9.11_, the Board
shall not grant any waiver or release under any "standstill agreement" with
respect to any class of Equity Interests of the Company. The Company shall
not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives to, enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the
date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent the
information specifically required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 9.11_.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 9.11_ shall prohibit the Company from
making any disclosure to the Stockholders that, in the good faith
determination of the Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
is required by applicable Laws.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been

Effective Time, in each case as and to the fullest extent permitted under (1)
the DGCL and (2) the terms of the Companys certificate of incorporation and

whether any such provisions are mandatory or permissive). In determining
whether an Indemnified Company Party is entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 9.12(a)_, if requested by such Indemnified Company Party, such
determination shall be made by special, independent counsel selected by the
Surviving Corporation and approved by the Indemnified Company Party (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and who has not otherwise
performed services for the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates within the
last three years (other than in connection with such matters).

would not (i) relate to periods after the Effective Time, (ii) adversely
affect the rights or obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation

furtherance of satisfaction and discharge of the 2011 Notes, but shall be
obligated to take any and all actions necessary to pay in full the 2011 Notes
on August 1, 2011 in accordance with the terms of the 2011 Notes and the 2011
Notes Indenture and (2) the 2011 Notes have been paid in full prior to the

required for inclusion in the Consent Solicitation and shall promptly provide
such other information or assistance in the preparation thereof as may be
reasonably requested by the Company.

as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, which efforts
shall include

 



      
 

 



 

having members of management and the Board solicit each Stockholder by

Stockholder Consent is obtained in an effort to obtain the approval of as many
Stockholders as reasonably practicable.

Indemnifiable Losses shall be limited, in the aggregate, to an amount equal to
the Fixed Escrow Amount. The aggregate liability of the Securityholders to
indemnify the Parent Indemnitees from and against any Parent Indemnifiable
Losses shall be limited to the

 



      
 

 



 

Fixed Escrow Amount and the amounts from time to time available in the Fixed
Escrow Account shall be the Parent Indemnitees sole recourse in respect of any
Parent Indemnifiable Losses. Without limitation of the foregoing, the
aggregate liability of the Securityholders to indemnify the Parent Indemnitees
from and against any and all Parent Indemnifiable Losses relating to claims
asserted under _Sections 11.2(a)(i)-(xii)_ shall be limited to the amounts
from time to time remaining in the General Indemnity Escrow and, subject to
_Schedule N_ , the Regulatory Indemnity Escrow and in no event shall any
Parent Indemnitees be entitled to assert any indemnification claims relating
to _Sections 11.2(a)(i)-(xii)_ against the Specific Indemnity Escrow or the
Waiver Escrow, it being understood that the Parties have agreed that the
Parent Indemnitees sole recourse in respect of any Parent Indemnifiable Losses
relating to (A) claims asserted under _Sections 11.2(a)(i)-(xii)_ shall be
the amounts from time to time available in the General Indemnity Escrow and
the Regulatory Indemnity Escrow and (B) claims asserted under _Sections
11.2(a)(xiii)_ shall be the amounts set forth on _Schedule N_.

 



 

(b) _Deductible Threshold_. The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to be
indemnified for Parent Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_
and _Sections 11.2(a)(iv)-(xii)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of all
such Parent Indemnifiable Losses exceeds $2,000,000 (the " ** _Deductible
Threshold_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Indemnitees shall
not be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ and
_Sections 11.2(a)(iv)-(xii)_ for any Losses with respect to any individual
items or matter unless the amount thereof exceeds $20,000 (the " ** _De
Minimis Threshold_**"), and if the De Minimis Threshold is not exceeded with
respect to any individual Loss, then none of the Losses with respect to such
item or matter will count toward satisfying the Deductible Threshold.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible Threshold and De Minimis
Threshold shall not apply to (and the Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to
be indemnified for all Parent Indemnifiable Losses relating to) any claims
asserted under _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ insofar as such claims relate to (1) any
breach of a Company Fundamental Representation, (2) any breach of the
representations set forth in clauses (a)-(c) of _Section 7.2_ (or, in the
case of clauses (1) and (2), to the extent related to any such representations
and warranties, any breach of any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the
Company to Parent prior to or at the Closing in connection with this
Agreement), (3) the certification in the Company Closing Certificate relating
to the matters set forth in _Section 10.1(a)(xviii)_ and _Section
10.1(a)(xix)_, or (4) any claims asserted under _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_,
_Section 11.2(a)(iii)_ and _Section 11.2(a)(xiii)_. Parent Indemnifiable
Losses from any claims to which the Deductible Threshold does not apply shall
not be considered in the calculation of the Deductible Threshold. Subject to
the foregoing, after the Deductible Threshold is exceeded, the Parent
Indemnitees shall be entitled to be paid the entire amount of any Parent
Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section 11.2(a)(i)_ and _Sections
11.2(a)(iv)-(xii)_ in excess of (but not including) the Payment Indemnifiable
Losses previously included in the calculation of the Deductible Threshold,
subject to the other limitations on recovery and recourse set forth in this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Other Limitations_.

 



 

(i) No Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any Indemnifiable Losses unless
a written claim for indemnification under this Agreement is delivered by the
Indemnified Person to the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto prior to the
General Indemnification Termination Date or, with respect to the matters set
forth on _Schedule N_ , to the extent permitted and contemplated by _Schedule
N_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that claims for any Indemnifiable Losses validly
asserted hereunder prior to the General Indemnification Termination Date or,
with respect to the matters set forth on _Schedule N_ , to the extent
permitted and contemplated by _Schedule N_ , shall survive until they are
finally resolved pursuant to the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement.
Notices to the Securityholders as Indemnifying Parties need only be furnished
to the Securityholders Representative.

 



 

(ii) No matter that gives rise to an adjustment under _Section 5.6_, will be
the subject of or eligible for a claim by any Parent Indemnitee for
indemnification under this _Article XI_; _provided_ that, Parent shall have
the right to withdraw funds from the Fixed Escrow Account to the extent
permitted by _Sections 5.6(g)_ and _5.6(h)_.

 



 

(iii) Without limitation, the indemnification obligations set forth in this
_Article XI_ also shall be subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
9.7(c)_ and _Section 13.16_.

 



 

(iv) Without limitation of _Section 9.7(c)_, the liability of the
Securityholders to indemnify the Parent Indemnitees pursuant to _Section
11.2(a)(i)_ shall not include Parent Indemnifiable Losses relating to a breach
by the Company of any of its representations and warranties set forth in
_Article VII_ (excluding _Section 7.22_) of which any of the officers of
Parent (or its Affiliates) listed in the definition of "Knowledge" has actual
conscious awareness as of the time of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section 9.7(c)_,
the foregoing waiver in this _Section 11.3(c)(iv)_ does not apply to any
indemnity set forth in _Section 11.2(a)(v)_ - _11.2(a)(xiii)_.

 



 

(d) _Cooperation_. An Indemnified Person shall, at the Indemnifying Partys
request and expense, cooperate in the defense of any matter subject to
indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(e) _Reduction for Tax Benefit or Loss; Insurance_. The amount of any
Indemnifiable Losses payable under _Article XI_ by an Indemnifying Party
shall be reduced by (i) the net present value of Tax savings or benefits
actually realized by the Indemnified Person that is attributable to any
deduction, loss, credit or other Tax benefit resulting from or arising out of
such Indemnifiable Losses and (ii) all proceeds from

 



      
 

 



 

insurance or other third party indemnification actually received by the
Indemnified Person.

 



 

(f) _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Person shall take and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to take all reasonable steps to mitigate and otherwise
minimize the Indemnifiable Losses to the maximum extent reasonably practicable
upon and after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected
to give rise to any Indemnifiable Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure on the part of any Indemnified Person to satisfy its obligations under
this _Section 11.3(f)_ shall relieve any Indemnifying Party from its
indemnification obligation under _Article XI_ of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit or affect an Indemnifying
Partys remedies for breach of this _Section 11.3(f)_ that are otherwise
available pursuant to this Agreement or applicable Law.

 



 

(g) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Fraud_. THE RIGHTS OF INDEMNITY PROVIDED IN
THIS _ARTICLE XI_ ARE THE PARTIES, THE SECURITYHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVES AND
THE SECURITYHOLDERS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO A BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the liability of any Person under
this _Article XI_ shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other
liability that such Person may have at law or equity based on such Persons
fraudulent acts, fraudulent omissions or intentional misrepresentation. None
of the provisions set forth in this Agreement, including the provisions set
forth in this _Section 11.3_, shall be deemed a waiver by any Person of (or a
limitation on) any right or remedy that such Person may have at law or equity
based on any other Persons fraudulent acts, fraudulent omissions or
intentional misrepresentation.

 



 

(h) _Characterization of Payments_. The Parties shall treat any payments made
pursuant to this _Article XI_ as an adjustment to the purchase price for
federal Tax purposes, unless a final determination (which shall include the
execution of a Form 870-AD or successor form) with respect to the Surviving
Corporation causes such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to, or
refund of, the purchase price for federal Tax purposes.

 



 

11.4 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

 



 

(a) If any third party shall notify any Indemnified Person with respect to any
matter (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** ") which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against an Indemnifying Party under this _Article XI_, the
Indemnified Person shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in
writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified
Person in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The notice
described in this _Section 11.4(a)_ shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail to the extent known, and shall indicate the amount
(estimated, if necessary and if then estimable) of the Indemnifiable Loss that
has been or may be suffered.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified
Person against the Third Party Claim with counsel of the Indemnifying Partys
choice, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, so long as: (i) the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Person, within thirty (30) days
after the Indemnified Person has given written notice of the Third Party Claim
to the Indemnifying Party (unless in such notice the Indemnified Person
certifies, in good faith, that the failure to assume such defense within
fifteen (15) days would materially prejudice the Indemnified Person by a delay
in assuming the defense beyond fifteen (15) days, in which case, the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to assume the defense subsequent to
the expiration of such fifteen (15) day period if the Indemnifying Party fails
to so assume the defense thereof as provided in and subject to _Section
11.4(d)_), that the Indemnifying Party is assuming the defense of such Third
Party Claim and shall indemnify the Indemnified Person against such Third
Party Claim in accordance with the terms and limitations of this _Article
XI_; and (ii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party
Claim in an active and diligent manner.

 



 

(c) So long as the conditions set forth in _Section 11.4(b)_ are and remain
satisfied: (i) the Indemnifying Party may conduct the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with _Section 11.4(b)_; (ii) the Indemnified Person
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , __ that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the attorneys fees of
the Indemnified Person if (A) the employment of separate counsel shall have
been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the
defense of such Third Party Claim or (B) the Indemnified Persons counsel
shall have advised the Indemnified Person in writing, with a copy delivered to
the Indemnifying Party, that there is a conflict of interest that would make
it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct to have
common counsel; and (iii) the Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Person (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into a settlement with
respect to a Third Party Claim; _provided_ that, the Indemnifying Party may,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, enter into a
settlement of a Third Party Claim so long as it (1) does not impose an
injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Person, (2) involves
the payment of money damages for which sufficient funds remain in the Fixed
Escrow Account and (3) includes an unconditional provision whereby the
plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the Indemnified Person and all of
its Affiliates and Representatives from all liability with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding _Sections 11.4(b)_ and _11.4(c)_ , the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to control (but shall be entitled to participate at its
own expense in the defense of), and the Indemnified Person shall be entitled
to have sole control over, the defense or settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgment of any Third Party Claim: (i) as to which the Indemnifying
Party fails to assume the defense within thirty (30) days after the
Indemnified Person gives notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (unless in
such notice the Indemnified Person certifies, in good faith, that the failure
to assume such defense within fifteen (15) days would materially prejudice the
Indemnified Person by a delay in assuming the defense beyond fifteen (15)
days), in which case, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to assume
the defense subsequent to the

 



      
 

 



 

expiration of such fifteen (15) day period if the Indemnifying Party fails to
so assume the defense thereof); (ii) to the extent the Third Party Claim seeks
an Order, injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Person
which, if successful, would adversely affect in any material respect the
business, operations, assets or financial condition of the Indemnified Person;
(iii) in the case where the Indemnifying Party fails to satisfy its
obligations under _Section 11.4(b)(ii)_ or _Section 11.4(c)(ii)_; or (iv) in
the case where the Securityholders are the Indemnifying Party and the Third
Party Claim in issue and the Indemnified Losses in connection therewith
involve or are reasonably likely to involve an amount in excess of 150% of the
amount remaining in the applicable portion of the Fixed Escrow Amount
available for the satisfaction of such Third Party Claim and Parent
Indemnifiable Losses (after taking into account the other unresolved Parent
Indemnifiable Losses asserted in good faith against such portion of the Fixed
Escrow Amount). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
11.4_, if an Indemnified Person assumes control of the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the costs incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with
the defense of such Third Party Claim shall not be included in the calculation
of Indemnifiable Losses relating to such Third Party Claim and shall be paid
solely by the Indemnified Person; _provided_ that, nothing in this _Section
11.4(d)_ shall limit the Parents or the Surviving Corporations right to
recover legal fees as and to the extent set forth on _Schedule N_.

 



 

(e) If an Indemnified Person assumes the control of the defense of any Third
Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 11.4_, such
Indemnified Person may enter into any settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgement of the validity of such Third Party Claim without obtaining
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnified Person shall make no settlement, compromise, admission or
acknowledgment that would (i) pursuant to its terms, impose any liability or
obligation (under this _Article XI_ or otherwise) on the part of the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) any admission that the Securityholders in their
capacity as Securityholders were at fault in connection with matter, omission
or event giving rise to the Third Party Claim, in each case without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(f) If an Indemnified Person assumes control of the defense of any Third Party
Claim in accordance with the provisions of _Section 11.4(d)(ii)_ or _(iv)_
and a judgment or arbitral award is rendered against such Indemnified Person
or any of its Affiliates, then the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for only
50% of the Losses otherwise subject to indemnification hereunder with respect
to such judgment or arbitral award.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the control, defense and
prosecution of the Schedule M Filings shall be governed exclusively by
_Section 9.1(e)_ and _Schedule Q_.

 



 

11.5 _Direct Claims_. In any case in which an Indemnified Person seeks
indemnification hereunder that is not subject to _Section 11.4_ because no
Third Party Claim is involved, the Indemnified Person shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of any Indemnifiable Losses that such
Indemnified Person claims are subject to indemnification under the terms
hereof. The

 



      
 

 



 

notice shall describe the indemnification sought in reasonable detail to the
extent known, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary and if
then estimable) of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be suffered.
Subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 11.1_ and _11.3_ , the
failure of the Indemnified Person to exercise promptness in such notification
shall not amount to a waiver of such claim unless and only to the extent that
the resulting delay materially and adversely prejudices the position of the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim.

 



 

11.6 _Construction with Tax Indemnity_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Securityholders shall only be obligated to
indemnify Parent Indemnitees for Taxes to the extent such Taxes constitute
Seller Taxes.

 



 

11.7 _No Waiver_. Except as provided in _Section 11.3(c)(iv)_ and _Section
9.7_, and the last sentence of _Section 12.1_, the fact that Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Person has Knowledge (or any other knowledge) of any breach
of this Agreement will not affect or otherwise limit in any respect any of the
rights of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Parent
Indemnitees under this Agreement, including _Sections 11.2_, _12.1(d)_ and
_12.1(e)_.

 



 

11.8 _Schedule N_. The terms and provisions of this _Article XI_ are subject
in all respects to the terms and conditions of _Schedule N_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII _ 
TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT_**

 



 

12.1 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing as provided in this
_Section 12.1_, subject to _Section 12.3_:

 



 

(a) Parent and the Company may terminate this Agreement by mutual written
consent at any time before Closing;

 



 

(b) Either Parent or the Company may terminate this Agreement by written
notice to the other if Closing shall not have occurred on or before September
15 **,** 2011 (the " ** _Termination Date_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 12.1(b)_ shall not
be available to any Party whose breach of this Agreement has been the cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of any condition to Closing set forth in
_Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_ to occur on or before such date;

 



 

(c) Parent or the Company may terminate this Agreement by written notice to
the other if any Governmental Authority shall have issued a final, non-
appealable Order, decree, ruling or other action shall have taken any other
action (which Order, decree or ruling Parent and the Company shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be removed), in each case
permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and
such Order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 12.1(c)_ shall not be available to any Party
that did not use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be removed any
such Order, decree, ruling or other action as and to the extent required by
_Section 9.1_;

 



       
 

 



 

(d) Parent or the Company may terminate this Agreement by written notice to
the other if there shall have been any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, by such other Party (which
in the case of the right of termination of the Company, shall also include any
breach by Merger Sub) which breach: (i) would give rise to the failure of a
condition to Closing set forth in _Sections 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_; and
(ii) either (A) cannot be cured or (B) if it can be cured, has not been cured
prior to the first to occur of (x) the date that is twenty (20) days following
receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach, or (y) the
date immediately preceding the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to contrary, Parents or Merger
Subs breach of the representations and warranties in _Section 8.5_ may not
form the basis for the Companys termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 12.1(d)_ and shall not give rise to Parents obligation to pay
the Reverse Break-Up Fee as a result of a termination under this _Section
12.1(d)_;

 



 

(e) Parent may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Company if,
as of immediately prior to the Closing, any one or more of the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article VII_ is not true, correct
and complete in all material respects and the failure, individually or in the
aggregate, to be so true, correct and complete in all material respects would
reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Company Entities, taken as a
whole, or the business of the Company Entities, taken as a whole, in any
material respect (determined as if such representations and warranties were
made as of the date hereof and as of immediately prior to the Closing, except
for any such representations and warranties made as of a specified date, which
shall be true and correct as of such specified date); _provided_ that, for
purposes of determining whether the foregoing standard has been met, all
"Material Adverse Effect," materiality and similar qualifiers contained in the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article VII_ shall be
disregarded for all purposes; and, _provided_ _further_ that, the foregoing
shall not be deemed, interpreted or construed to mean (or require Parent to
establish the occurrence of) a Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(f) Parent may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Company if
the Stockholder Consent is not obtained, and a copy of all signatures of
Stockholders comprising such Stockholder Consent are not delivered to Parent,
on or prior to the date that is thirty (30) days from the Mailing Date;

 



 

(g) Parent may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Company if
the Company fails to make, withdraws, changes, conditions or modifies, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or makes a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change; or

 



 

(h) the Company may terminate this Agreement if, prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Consent, the Company (i) executes a binding agreement to implement
a Superior Proposal, such termination to be effective upon delivery to Parent
of a written notice of termination pursuant to this _Section 12.1(h)_, which
notice shall be delivered to Parent contemporaneously with executing such
binding agreement to implement a Superior Proposal and shall be accompanied by
a copy of the executed agreement

 



      
 

 



 

implementing the Superior Proposal and (ii) pays the Break-Up Fee to Parent
contemporaneously with the delivery in clause (i).

 



 

For purposes of _Sections 12.1(d)_ and _12.1(e)_ , Parent and Merger Sub shall
not be entitled to exericse their termination rights pursuant thereto as a
result of any breach by the Company of any of its representations and
warranties of which any of the officers of Parent (or its Affiliates) listed
in the definition of "Knowledge" had actual conscious awareness as of the time
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent.

Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1_ shall give written notice thereof to
each other Party, whereupon this Agreement shall, subject to _Section 12.3_,
automatically terminate. Upon termination of this Agreement there shall be no
liability or obligation hereunder on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or
stockholders, except that: (i) _Article I_ (to the extent relevant to this
_Article XII_ or _Article XIII_), this _Article XII_ and _Article XIII_
shall survive such termination; and (ii) no such termination shall relieve any
Party from liability for fraud. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 12.1_ by Parent shall constitute a termination by and on behalf of
Parent and Merger Sub. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section

termination (except where a Party is seeking to compel specific performance as
aforesaid with the obligation to close the Merger), return or destroy all

Party with respect to any other Party shall be treated in accordance with the
terms of _Section 13.10_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Sections 12.1(f)_
or _12.1(g)_ , or by the Company pursuant to _Section 12.1(h)_, the Company
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Break-Up Fee.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by (A) Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 12.1(b)_, and at the time of such termination (x) all of the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 10.1_ have been satisfied and (y)
the Company is ready, willing and able to comply with all of its obligations
under _Section 10.3(a)_, or (B) by the Company pursuant to _Section 12.1(d)_
and at the time of the Companys termination pursuant to _Section 12.1(d)_
the Company is not then in breach of this Agreement, which breach would permit
Parent to terminate this Agreement, or (ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section
12.1(e)_, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Reverse
Break-Up Fee.

 



 

(c) Any Break-Up Fee or Reverse Break-Up Fee owed pursuant to this _Section
12.3_ shall be due and payable in full contemporaneously with the termination
of this Agreement.

right to

which such fee is owed and paid, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company and the Securityholders, and their respective Affiliates, for all
Losses suffered as a result of the termination of this Agreement and the
failure of the consummation of the Merger; (ii) Parents right to receive
payment of the Break-Up Fee shall, in the circumstances in which such fee is
owed and paid, constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger
Sub, and their respective Affiliates, for all Losses suffered as a result of
the termination of this Agreement and the failure of the consummation of the
Merger, (iii) that the agreements contained in this _Section 12.3_ are an
integral part of this Agreement, (iv) each of the Break-Up Fee and the Reverse
Break-Up Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as applicable, in the
circumstances in which such amount is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (v) without these agreements, the Parties
would not enter into this Agreement. Parent may pursue either a grant of
specific performance pursuant to _Section 13.15_ or the payment of the Break-
Up Fee in accordance with this _Section 12.3_, _provided_ , that under no
circumstances shall Parent be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance and the Break-Up Fee. The Company may pursue either a
grant of specific performance pursuant to _Section 13.15_ or the payment of
the Reverse Break-Up Fee in accordance with this _Section 12.3_, _provided_ ,

receive both a grant of specific performance and the Reverse Break-Up Fee.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIII _

required by securities Laws, applicable stock exchange rules and regulations

the Party proposing to make the announcement or disclosure, legally required
to be made, (with respect to which the Parties shall consult in advance if
practicable under the circumstances) there shall be no press release or public
communication concerning the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby prior to Closing by any Party except with the prior
written consent of the Parties not originating such press release or
communication, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
have the right to disclose the existence of this Agreement in any Form 8-K

Company shall consider in good faith all comments of Parent in such Form 8-K
prior to its filing. Prior to Closing, Parent and the Company shall consult in
advance on the necessity for, and the timing and content of, any

Partys sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may assign any

Parent without obtaining the consent of the Company, but only if such
assignment will not affect materially and adversely the ability of such
assignee to consummate the Merger and any such assignment shall not relieve

affect such obligations in any matter. Any attempted assignment in violation
of this _Section 13.3_ shall be void.

matter hereof and thereof and supersede any prior understandings,
negotiations, correspondence, undertaking, agreements, or representations by

Agreement. No amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement
made prior to the Effective Time shall be valid unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by all of the Parties. No amendment or modification of any
provision of this Agreement made following the Effective Time shall be valid

13.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the

substance of the transactions contemplated herein is not effected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party.

 



 

13.9 _Transaction Expenses_. Except as expressly provided herein, each of
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,

constitutes: (a) exceptions or qualifications to particular representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations of the Company as set forth in this
Agreement; or (b) descriptions or lists of assets and liabilities and other
items referred to in this Agreement. The Disclosure Schedules shall not be
construed as indicating that any disclosed information is required to be
disclosed, and no disclosure shall be construed as an admission of liability
or as an admission that such information is material to, outside the Ordinary
Course of Business of, or required to be

 



      
 

 



 

disclosed by, the Company or constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.

or the Securityholders Representative in the performance of any provision,
condition or requirement herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of, or in any
manner release the other Party or the Securityholders Representative from,
performance of any other provision, condition or requirement herein, nor shall
such waiver be deemed to be a waiver of, or in any manner a release of, the
other Party or the Securityholders Representative from future performance of
the same provision, condition or requirement. Any delay or omission of any
Party or the Securityholders Representative, in whole or in part, to exercise
any right hereunder shall not impair the exercise of any such right, or any
like right, accruing to it thereafter. The failure of any Party to perform its
obligations hereunder shall not release any other Party from the performance
of such obligations.

 



 

13.13 _Captions_. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only, and
shall not be considered a part of or affect the meaning or interpretation of
any provision of this Agreement.

forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

 



 

13.15 _Specific Performance_. Subject to _Section 12.3(d)_, the Parties

pursuant to the Merger Agreement and remit such funds so collected promptly to
the Escrow Agent. Any amounts deducted from the General Indemnity Escrow Funds
due to non-payment by shall reduce any amounts payable to Parent out of the

amounts deducted from any portion of the General Indemnity Escrow Funds
validly payable to the Securityholders hereunder.

 



 

(e) The Securityholders Representative may instruct that the Escrow Agent
deliver any Escrow Funds that are otherwise to be delivered to the Payment

Such fees and expenses shall be borne one-half by the Securityholders Representative and one-half by Parent; _provided_ that the fees and expenses owed by the Securityholders Representative (including pursuant to Section 6(e)) shall be deducted from the account established pursuant to the Securityholders Representative Escrow Agreement as and when due and owing. If the fees and expenses due to the Escrow Agent by Parent hereunder are not paid when due, or if the Parents obligations to the Escrow Agent under Section 6(e) hereof are not satisfied on demand, then the Securityholders Representative and Parent irrevocably authorize the Escrow Agent to deduct any such amounts from the General Indemnity Escrow Funds without prior notice or demand to any Person ( _provided_ that the Escrow Agent shall provide the

      
 

 



 

Securityholders Representative and Parent prompt written notice following any
such deductions). Any amounts deducted from the General Indemnity Escrow Funds
due to non-payment by Parent pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall reduce
any amounts payable to Parent out of the General Indemnity Escrow Funds and,
to the extent there are insufficient funds validly payable to Parent out of
the General Indemnity Escrow Funds, Parent shall pay to the Payment Agent for
disbursement to the Securityholders any amounts deducted from any portion of
the General Indemnity Escrow Funds validly payable to the Securityholders
hereunder. If the amount deposited pursuant to the Securityholders
Representative Escrow Agreement is insufficient to pay any fees and expense
due to the Escrow Agent by the Securityholders Representative pursuant to this
Escrow Agreement (including pursuant to Section 6(e)), then the
Securityholders Representative and Parent irrevocably authorize the Escrow
Agent to deduct any such amounts from the General Indemnity Escrow Funds
without prior notice or demand to any Person ( _provided_ that the Escrow
Agent shall provide the Securityholders Representative and Parent prompt
written notice following any such deductions). **** If the amount of the
General Indemnity Escrow Funds is insufficient to pay any fees and expenses
due to the Escrow Agent by the Securityholders Representative pursuant to the
foregoing sentence then the Securityholders Representative shall be obligated
to collect such fees and expenses from the Securityholders pursuant to the
Merger Agreement and remit such funds so collected promptly to the Escrow
Agent. **** Any amounts deducted from the General Indemnity Escrow Funds due
to non-payment by the Securityholders Representative pursuant to the foregoing
sentence shall reduce any amounts payable to Payment Agent for disbursement to
the Securityholders out of the General Indemnity Escrow Funds. If the amount
of the General Indemnity Escrow Funds is insufficient to pay any fees and
expenses due to the Escrow Agent by Parent or the Securityholders
Representative pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, then, upon written notice to
Parent and the Securityholders Representative, the Escrow Agent may suspend
performance of its obligations under this Escrow Agreement until it has been
paid all such fees and expenses, without incurring any liability to any
person.

Agent under or in connection with this Escrow Agreement taken or made in good
faith and without gross negligence or willful misconduct; and (viii) for
special, incidental, consequential, indirect or punitive damages in any event

such loss or damages and regardless of the form of action.

 



 

(c) The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of its
duties hereunder by or through its attorneys, agents, receivers or employees.
The Escrow Agent is entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters

non-action taken or made in good faith in reliance on any such opinion or
advice.

 



 

(d) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order, judgment,

correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the
service thereof. The Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instrument or
signature reasonably believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the
person purporting to give receipt or advice or make any statement or execute
any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized
to do so.

 



 

(e) Each of Securityholders Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders,
and Parent will indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent and each of its officers,
directors, employees and affiliates (the **"Indemnified Parties** ") harmless
from and against any and all claims, suits, liabilities, costs, damages and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) suffered or
incurred by an Indemnified Party and arising out of or relating to this Escrow
Agreement, except any such claims, suits, liabilities, costs, damages or
expenses suffered or incurred by an Indemnified Party as a result of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of any Indemnified Party. Parent and the
Securityholders Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders, shall each
be liable for one-half of the payments owing to the Escrow Agent under this
Section 6(e).

 



 

7. _Term; Termination_.

 



 

(a) This Escrow Agreement shall terminate on first to occur of (i) the date as

(b) The Escrow Agent may resign as escrow agent hereunder upon 30 days prior
written notice to the Securityholders Representative and Parent. The
Securityholders Representative and Parent may at any time, with or without

excess of $2 billion, shall be appointed jointly by the Securityholders
Representative and Parent and notified to the Escrow Agent by written notice
signed by the Securityholders Representative and Parent and delivered to the

resignation or removal of the predecessor Escrow Agent shall become effective
and such successor escrow agent, without any further act, deed or conveyance,
shall become vested with all right, title and interest in and to all cash and
property held hereunder of such predecessor Escrow Agent. No such resignation
or removal shall discharge any liability or obligations of the Escrow Agent
arising prior to the effective time of such resignation or removal.

 



 

(c) All obligations of the Escrow Agent hereunder shall cease and terminate on
the effective date of its resignation or removal and its sole responsibility
thereafter shall be to hold the Escrow Funds for a period of 30 calendar days
following the effective date of resignation or removal, at which time, if a
successor escrow agent shall have been appointed and have accepted such
appointment in a writing to the Securityholders Representative and Parent,
then upon written notice thereof given by the Securityholders Representative
and Parent to the resigning or removed Escrow Agent, the resigning or removed
Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrowed Funds to the successor escrow agent.
If a successor escrow agent shall not have been appointed within a 30-day
period from the Escrow Agents resignation or removal, for any reason
whatsoever, the resigning or removed Escrow Agent may deliver the Escrow Funds
to a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which the Escrow Funds
are then being held and give written notice of the same to the Securityholders
Representative and Parent. The Escrow Agents sole responsibility after such
30-day notice period expires shall be to hold the Escrow Funds (without any

shall hold an annual meeting of its stockholders to elect directors and
transact any other business within its powers on any date during the period of
April 6 through May 6 as determined year to year by the Board of Directors.
The time and location of the meeting shall be determined by the Board of
Directors.

 



 

SECTION 1.02. **_Special Meetings_**. Special meetings of the stockholders
shall be held upon the calling by the Chairman of the Board or the President,
or by the Board of Directors by vote at a meeting or by unanimous written
consent. The business at all special meetings shall be confined to that
specifically named in the notice thereof. The time and location of the meeting
shall be determined by the Board of Directors.

 



 

SECTION 1.03. **_Notice of Meetings; Waiver of Notice_**. Written notice of
every meeting of the stockholders, whether annual or special, stating the
place, day and hour of such meeting, the means of remote communications, if
any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in
person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of special meetings, the
business proposed to be transacted, shall be given by the Secretary to each
stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten (10) days but
not more than sixty (60) days before the date fixed for such meeting. Notice
is given to a stockholder when it is personally delivered to the stockholder,
left at the stockholders residence or usual place of business, deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such
stockholders address as it appears on the records of the Company or delivered
by a form of

      
 

 



 

electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, notice of any meeting of stockholders is waived by any
stockholder who is present at the meeting in person or by proxy, except when a
person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning
of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened, or who, before or after the meeting, signs a
waiver of notice or provides a waiver by electronic transmission, which is
filed with the records of stockholders meetings. A meeting of the
stockholders convened on the date for which it was called may be adjourned
from time to time without further notice if the time, place and the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at the adjourned meeting are announced
at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. If the adjournment is for
more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

 



 

SECTION 1.04. **_Organization of Meeting_**. All meetings of the stockholders
shall be called to order by the Chairman of the Board, or in his or her

the meeting shall organize by electing a chairman. The Secretary of the
Company, if present, shall act as Secretary of the meeting, unless some other
person shall be elected by the meeting to act. Minutes of the meeting shall be
kept by the Secretary thereof, and placed in the record books of the Company.

 



 

SECTION 1.05. **_Quorum; Voting_**. Unless otherwise provided by law or the
Companys certificate of incorporation, at a meeting of stockholders the
presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of
all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business, and a majority of all the votes cast at a meeting
at which a quorum is present is sufficient to approve any matter, other than
the election of Directors, which properly comes before the meeting. Directors
shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the
meeting. In the absence of a quorum, the

 



      
 

 



 

stockholders present in person or by proxy, by majority vote and without
notice other than as required by law or these Bylaws, may adjourn the meeting
from time to time until a quorum shall attend. In the event that at any
meeting a quorum exists for the transaction of some business but does not
exist for the transaction of other business, the business as to which a quorum
is present may be transacted by the stockholders present in person or by proxy
who are entitled to vote thereon.

 



 

SECTION 1.06. **_General Right to Vote; Proxies_**. At all meetings of the
stockholders each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of
common stock standing in the stockholders name and, when preferred or
preference stock is entitled to vote, such number of votes as shall be
provided in the certificate of incorporation of the Company for each share of
preferred and preference stock standing in the stockholders name, and the
votes shall be cast by stockholders in person or by lawful proxy.

 



 

SECTION 1.07. **_Conduct of Voting_**. At all meetings of stockholders, the
proxies and ballots shall be received, and all questions touching the
qualification of voters and the validity of proxies and the acceptance or
rejection of votes shall be decided by the Chairman of the meeting.

 



 

SECTION 1.08. **_Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_**. Any action
required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of stockholders may be taken
without a meeting if there is filed with the records of stockholders meetings
a written consent which sets forth the action and is signed by holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

removal or an increase in the number of Directors, may be filled by a majority
of the remaining Directors although such majority is less than a quorum. Any

without a meeting.

 



 

SECTION 2.07. **_Notice of Meeting_**. The Secretary shall give notice to each
Director of each regular and special meeting of the Board of Directors. The
notice shall state the time and, unless the meeting shall be held solely by

or usual place of business, or transmitted electronically or by telegraph or
telephone, at least twenty-four (24) hours before the time of the meeting or,
in the alternative, deposited in the mail addressed to the Directors address
as it shall appear on the records of the Company, at least seventy-two (72)

Directors is waived by any Director who attends the meeting or who, before or
after the meeting, signs a waiver of notice or provides a waiver by electronic
transmission which is filed with the records of the meeting. Any meeting of
the Board of Directors, regular or special, may adjourn from time to time to
reconvene at the same or some other place, and no notice need be given of any

(the documents described in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " ** _Tax

promptly (and in any event within two (2)Business Days) respond to any
telephone, email or mail requests from Securityholders for information
relating to the Letters of Transmittal or the surrender of stock certificates
and the payment of cash therefor.

 



 

3.3 **Proper Form.** The Payment Agent will examine the Letters of Transmittal
and certificates representing Shares delivered or mailed to the Payment Agent
by the Stockholders to ascertain that (i) the Letters of Transmittal are
properly completed and duly executed in accordance with the instructions set
forth therein, (ii) no stop transfer instructions are outstanding against the
certificates (which determination shall be based solely on the information

form for surrender, (iv) any other documents contemplated by a Letter of
Transmittal are properly completed and duly executed in accordance with the
Letter of Transmittal, (v) such Shares do not constitute Dissenting Shares,
and (vi) the documentation received from the Stockholder includes the properly
completed and executed applicable Tax Form. If the applicable Tax Form is not
provided to the Payment Agent by a Securityholder, or is not properly
completed and executed, the Payment Agent shall contact the applicable
Securityholder and attempt to obtain a properly completed and executed Tax
Form. If such Securityholder fails to respond and deliver a properly completed
and executed Tax Form within 20 days after the Payment Agents attempt to
contact such Securityholder, the Payment Agent shall, provided the other
conditions to payment are satisfied, make payment of the Closing Date Payment
and any subsequent Escrow Fund Payments (as defined below) to such
Securityholder (and such payments will be subject to applicable withholding as
set forth in Section 3.6 below). In cases where the Letter of Transmittal has
been improperly completed or executed or where the Shares presented are not in
proper form for transfer,

 



      
 

 



 

or if some other irregularity exists in connection with their surrender,
including any irregularity relating to stop transfer instructions, the Payment
Agent will seek instructions from Parent and the Securityholders
Representative and will, thereafter, take such actions as are reasonably
within its authority under this Agreement to cause such irregularity to be
corrected. The Payment Agent is not authorized to waive an irregularity in
connection with the surrender of Shares, except following receipt of the prior
written approval of an Authorized Representative of Parent and the
Securityholders Representative authorizing the Payment Agent to waive such
irregularity; _provided_ that the Payment Agent and Parent agree that Parent
and the Securityholders Representative waiving such irregularity in accordance
with this Agreement shall not cause the Payment Agent to be subjected to any
potential liability related thereto. In the absence of such waiver by Parent
and the Securityholders Representative, the Payment Agent is authorized not to
accept such stock certificates for exchange and will return to the
surrendering Stockholder by trackable mail method to such Stockholders
address as set forth on _Schedule A_ , the Letter of Transmittal, any stock
certificates surrendered in connection therewith and any other documents
received therewith, together with a written explanation of the reason for the
Payment Agents determination not to accept the stock certificates for
exchange. Parent acknowledges and agrees that Securityholders holding RSUs
shall not be required to submit any documentation other than a Surrender
Agreement and the applicable Tax Form in order to become an Eligible
Securityholder and to receive Escrow Funds Payments hereunder.

 



 

3.4 **Payments.**

 



 

(a) **Payment of Merger Consideration.** Parent hereby directs the Payment
Agent, consistent with this Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal and
_Schedule A_ (as the same may be amended, modified or revised from time to
time in accordance with this Agreement), to mail by first class mail to each
Eligible Securityholder holding Shares a check drawn, or remit a bank wire
transfer (if applicable), in an amount set forth on _Schedule A_ directly
opposite from such Securityholders name (each such amount the " ** _Closing
Date Payment_** ") as soon as reasonably practicable (but in all events within
two (2) Business Days) following the receipt of (i) a Letter of Transmittal
and (ii) stock certificate(s) representing Shares (subject to Section 3.5
below). Wire transfer instructions will be provided for each Securityholder
electing a bank wire transfer by direction of the Securityholder in accordance
with the Letter of Transmittal, if applicable. Checks shall be made payable to
the holder of record of the Shares, or to the person, if any, whose name has
been specified in the Letter of Transmittal received by the Payment Agent with
respect to payment for such Shares. Parent and the Payment Agent acknowledge
and agree that no payment from the Initial Payment Fund will be made to
Securityholders in respect of RSUs.

 



 

(b) **Payment of Escrow Funds. **Parent hereby directs the Payment Agent, upon
each receipt of Escrow Funds from the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of
the Indemnity and Adjustment Escrow Agreement or the Securityholders
Representative Escrow Agreement, to mail by first class mail to each Eligible
Securityholder, a check drawn, or remit a bank wire transfer (if applicable),
in an amount equal to such Securityholders Percentage Share (as set forth on
_Schedule A_ directly opposite from such Securityholders name) of such Escrow
Funds, subject to any withholding of taxes in accordance with Section 3.6
hereof (each such payment, an " ** _Escrow Funds Payment_** ") as soon as
reasonably practicable following receipt of the Escrow Funds (but in all
events within two (2) Business Days). Wire transfer instructions will be
provided for each Securityholder electing a bank wire transfer by direction of
the Securityholder in accordance with the Letter of Transmittal, if
applicable. Checks shall be made payable to the holder of record of the Shares
or RSUs, as applicable, or to the person, if any, whose name has been
specified in the Letter of Transmittal or Surrender Agreement, as applicable,
received by the Payment Agent.

 



 

3.5 **Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.** If any Stockholder reports to
the Payment Agent that such Securityholders failure to surrender a
certificate representing any Shares is due to the

 



      
 

 



 

loss or destruction of such certificate, the Payment Agent shall require such
Stockholder to furnish an affidavit of loss and, if requested by the Payment
Agent, a $100 payment to the Payment Agent and/or an indemnity bond in the
amount of the consideration to be paid to the Stockholder in respect of such
lost certificates; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall a
Stockholder be required to pay more than 5% of the total amount of the
consideration which may be received by it pursuant to the Merger Agreement for
the lost, destroyed or stolen Certificates (or such lesser amount as Parent
may reasonably agree to) in order to obtain such indemnity bond, and in the
event the cost of such indemnity bond would exceed 5%, then the Stockholder
shall only be required to purchase an indemnity bond providing the maximum
amount of coverage that may be purchased for a price equal to 5% of the total
amount of the consideration which may be received by the Stockholder for the
lost, destroyed or stolen Certificates. Upon receipt of such affidavit of
loss, Parent instructs the Payment Agent to effect payment to the
Securityholder as though it had surrendered its stock certificate.

 



 

3.6 **Tax Reporting and Withholding.**

 



 

(a) **Payments to Securityholders.** The Payment Agent will prepare and mail
to each Securityholder on behalf of Parent, other than with respect to the
RSUs, the appropriate Internal Revenue Service (" ** _IRS_** ") Form 1099-B or
other applicable form for each Securityholder with respect to all payments
made (including any withheld amounts treated as made) under this Agreement
unless Parent directs otherwise prior to payment to the Securityholder. The
Payment Agent will file copies of such Forms 1099-B or other applicable form
with the IRS or other taxing authority before the deadline for remittance and
information reporting in accordance with the Treasury Regulations. With
respect to the holders of RSUs, Parent will, or Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, handle or cause to be handled any tax reporting that
must be done on IRS Form W-2, 1099 MISC or other applicable forms.

 



 

(b) **IRS Tax Identification Forms and Withholding.** The Payment Agent shall
be considered the payor with respect to payments made to the Securityholders
other than with respect to RSUs on behalf of Parent pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, including payments of Escrow Funds. Accordingly, the Payment
Agent is considered the "withholding agent" for purposes of such payments as
that term is defined under the United States Treasury Regulations. The Payment
Agent will solicit the Tax Forms as part of the Letter of Transmittal mailing
to the Stockholders. The Payment Agent will determine from the materials
reviewed pursuant to Section 3.3 whether it has obtained the properly
completed and executed Tax Forms from each Securityholder other than with
respect to RSUs. The Payment Agent shall remit copies of all Tax Forms
received from Securityholders to Parent upon written request from Parent. To
the extent the Payment Agent is required to withhold any taxes from payments
to a Securityholder other than with respect to RSUs, the Payment Agent shall
cause such amounts to be withheld and deposited with the IRS in accordance
with United States Treasury Regulations. Such amounts will be withheld only
from the Securityholders other than with respect to RSUs with respect to whom
the applicable properly completed and executed Tax Forms were not received,
was not properly completed, or if such Tax Forms indicate that the
Securityholder is not exempt from tax withholding, and the withheld amount
shall be treated as having been paid to such Securityholder for purposes of
satisfying Parents obligation to pay such Securityholder in accordance with
the Merger Agreement.

 



 

Promptly after the Payment Agent receives Escrow Funds, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (or the designee of either) shall determine the
corresponding Employer Tax Amount with respect to Escrow Funds to be
distributed to Securityholders surrendering RSUs. Parent or Surviving
Corporation shall solicit appropriate tax forms from the holders of RSUs.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.6(b), promptly
after the determination of the Employer Tax Amount, the Payment Agent shall
pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds such Employer Tax Amount
to a payroll processor designated in writing by Parent, or such other person
that is responsible for the preparation and payment of employment tax returns
and remittance of the Employer

 



      
 

 



 

Tax Amount with and to the IRS and other applicable taxing authorities, in
each case, for remittance to the IRS and other applicable taxing authority in
respect of employee employment tax. Parent, Surviving Corporation or such
person designated by Parent or Surviving Corporation shall be the "withholding
agent" with respect to all payments with respect to the RSUs.

 



 

(c) **Indemnification.** Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold the Payment
Agent harmless from and against any tax, late payment, interest, penalty or
other cost or expense that may be assessed against the Payment Agent arising
out of or in connection with the performance of the Payment Agents
obligations under the terms of this Section 3.6 unless such tax, late payment,
interest, penalty or other expense resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Payment Agent or the failure to comply with Section
3.6(b). The indemnification provided by this Section 3.6(c) is in addition to
the indemnification provided in Section 5.5 and shall survive the resignation
or removal of the Payment Agent and the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

3.7 **Submission of Stock Certificates by Stockholders Not of Record but Who
Have Acquired Their Shares in Due Course.** Certain stock certificates
representing Shares may be tendered by Securityholders who are holders in due
course but are not registered holders. Upon submission of such a certificate
duly endorsed or with assignments duly executed by the registered holder of
the Shares represented thereby (or by such registered holders duly appointed
agent, attorney, executor, administrator, guardian or other fiduciary),
together with the requisite medallion guarantee of signature (and evidence of
authority if appropriate), and in accordance with the Securities Transfer
Association guidelines, if such certificate is accompanied by a duly completed
and executed Letter of Transmittal, the Payment Agent will be entitled to
treat such certificate as if surrendered by the registered holder thereof, and
make the requisite payment to the holder in due course.

 



 

3.8 **Cancellation of Surrendered Stock Certificates.** At the time of the
payments pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, the Payment Agent will cancel each
stock certificate surrendered in exchange for such payment. For the term of
this Agreement the Payment Agent will maintain on a continuing basis a list of
Eligible Securityholders, and at the request of Parent or the Securityholders
Representative, the Payment Agent will inform it as to which Securityholders
are Eligible Securityholders. The Payment Agent will also make available to
Parent such other information as it may have in its possession and as Parent
may reasonably request from time to time. After the Paying Agent has paid and
canceled the stock certificates surrendered, such canceled certificates shall
be returned to the Parent at the address provided in this Agreement unless
otherwise notified in writing by the Parent of an alternate address.

 



 

3.9 **Database of Electronic Records.** Subject to applicable law and
regulation and this Section 3.9, the Payment Agent shall maintain (a)
electronic records in a retrievable database or (b) physical records of all
received: (i) stock certificates, (ii) Letters of Transmittal, and (iii) Tax
Forms, and the Payment Agent shall provide a copy of such records to Parent
and the Securityholders Representative upon written request (at the requesting
partys expense). The Payment Agent shall also maintain such electronic
records or physical records for the time period required by applicable law and
regulation.

 



 

3.10 **Mailing of Second Letter of Transmittal and Unexchanged Securityholder
Program.** No later than four months after the Effective Time or upon the
earlier request in writing of Parent, the Payment Agent shall send a second
Letter of Transmittal to any Securityholder that is not an Eligible
Securityholder, or that has been otherwise identified by Parent in such
request. From time to time upon the request in writing of Parent and at
Parents expense, the Payment Agent shall utilize the services of an
unexchanged stockholder search company (a " ** _Search Company_** ") for the
purpose of locating Securityholders that have not surrendered Shares or
submitted Letters of Transmittal and assisting them in doing so. If an
additional agreement with a Search Company needs to be signed in order to
fulfill the

 



      
 

 



 

request of Parent, such agreement shall be on terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to the Payment Agent and Parent.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4**

 



 

 **UNCLAIMED PROPERTY**

 



 

4.1 **Unclaimed Property Administration.** Subject to applicable unclaimed
property laws, the Payment Agent will initiate unclaimed property reporting
services for unclaimed Shares and cash distributions, which may be deemed
abandoned or otherwise subject to applicable unclaimed property law or
regulation. Such services may include preparation of unclaimed property
reports, delivery of abandoned property to various states, completion of
required due diligence notifications, responses to inquiries from owners, and
such other services as may reasonably be necessary to comply with applicable
unclaimed property laws or regulations.

 



 

4.2 **Information about Unclaimed Property.** Parent shall assist the Payment
Agent and provide such cooperation as may reasonably be necessary in the
performance of the services hereunder.

Parent or the Surviving Corporation in responding to inquiries from
administrators of state unclaimed property laws or regulations regarding
reports filed on their behalf or in response to requests to confirm the name
of a reclaiming owner. The Payment Agent shall exercise reasonable efforts to
obtain release agreements from the various states offering such release
agreements with respect to reports and abandoned property delivered to them
and indemnification agreements from those states willing to provide them.

 



 

4.4 **Remittance of Unclaimed Property.** The Payment Agent or its duly
appointed agent shall timely remit unclaimed funds to the appropriate state or
jurisdiction, as provided for under applicable unclaimed property law or
regulation. The Payment Agent shall provide such reports regarding unclaimed

time.

Exchange Commission (" ** _SEC_** ") rules (See SEC Rule 240.17 Ad-17, as
amended), the Payment Agent is required to provide the following services
regarding lost security holder accounts, which together constitute Standard
Search Services: (a) conduct a national database search between three and
twelve months after a lost security holder account is identified; (b) if the
first national database search is not successful in locating the holder,
conduct a second search between six and twelve months later; and (c) report to
the SEC in required filings, information about the age of lost security holder
accounts and amounts escheated to the various states. Exceptions to the SEC
search requirements include deceased security holders, security holders that
are not natural persons (e.g., corporations, partnerships), and cases where
the value of all amounts due to the security holder are less than $25.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5**

 



 

 **RIGHTS OF THE PAYMENT AGENT**

 



 

5.1 **Advice of Counsel.**

 



 

(a) **Advice in Case of Defective Submission.** The Payment Agent is
authorized to cooperate with and furnish information to Parent and the
Securityholders Representative and shall seek

 



       
 

 



 

and follow, and may rely upon, advice of Parent or its counsel with respect to
any action to be taken by the Payment Agent if the Payment Agent receives any
of the following:

 



 

(i) any request for payment with respect to certificates claimed to be lost or
stolen;

 



 

(ii) any submission of stock certificates not accompanied by a duly completed
and executed Letter of Transmittal;

 



 

(iii) any request that payment be made with respect to any Shares or RSUs to
any person other than the registered holder thereof (except as provided for in
Section 3.7 above); or

 



 

(iv) any request by a Securityholder that the Payment Agent take any action
other than that specified in this Agreement with respect to the exchange of
his or her Shares or the making or payments hereunder.

 



 

(b) **Advice in Other Cases.** Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
5.l(a) above, the Payment Agent may, when the Payment Agent deems it desirable
and after prior consultation with Parent, seek advice of the Payment Agents
own counsel in connection with the Payment Agents services as Payment Agent
hereunder and the Payment Agent shall be entitled in to rely in good faith
upon any such advice received in writing and to be compensated for the fees
and expenses of such counsel as provided in Section 5.2 below.

 



 

5.2 **Fees and Expenses.** The Payment Agent shall receive, from Parent, as
compensation for the performance of its duties as such hereunder, the fees set
forth on _Schedule B_. All reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
reasonably incurred by the Payment Agent under this Agreement will be
reimbursed to the Payment Agent by Parent. Such costs may include, but are not
limited to, postage mail insurance, stationery and supplies, checks,
envelopes, paper stock and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel. Payment
Agent agrees that it will endeavor to obtain competitive rates for out-of-
pocket costs; however, these costs as passed on to Parent may include charges
to cover the cost of receipt and handling of invoices.

 



 

5.3 **Authorized Company Representatives.** Set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto
is a list of the names, titles, and specimen signatures of the persons
authorized by Parent and the Securityholders Representative to give the
Payment Agent any further instructions in connection with the Payment Agent
acting as Payment Agent hereunder (such persons, the " ** _Authorized
Representatives_** ").

 



 

5.4 **Reliance upon Certificates, Instructions.** The Payment Agent shall be
protected in relying and acting, or refusing to act, without further
investigation upon any written certificate or certification, instruction,
direction, statement, request, consent, agreement, or other written instrument
(collectively " ** _Certificates and Instructions_** ") whatsoever furnished
to the Payment Agent by an Authorized Representative, not only as to its due
execution and validity and the effectiveness of its provisions, but also as to
the truth and accuracy of any information therein contained, which the Payment
Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine or to have been signed or
presented by a proper person or persons. The Payment Agent shall have no
responsibility or liability for the accuracy or inaccuracy of such
Certificates and Instructions.

 



 

5.5 **Standard of Care; Indemnification.**

 



 

(a) Payment Agent shall have only those duties and responsibilities as
expressly set forth herein, and no other duty, obligation or covenant,
fiduciary or otherwise, shall be implied or

 



      
 

 



 

enforceable against Payment Agent by any person. Without limiting the effect
of the immediately preceding sentence, Payment Agent shall have no obligation
or liability to any party hereto (or any person claiming through any of them)
(i) to review, examine, enforce, administer or take notice of any agreement,
instrument or document other than this Agreement or as expressly provided in
this Agreement, (ii) to determine whether any condition precedent to a
disbursement of funds hereunder, other than as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, have been or will be satisfied or otherwise to investigate any
notice received by Payment Agent hereunder, (iii) to evaluate or determine the
validity or legality of any action or omission by any other person, (iv) to
make any payment to any person from any source other than a fund or account
established pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, (v) to communicate with any person other than as expressly
provided for in this Agreement, (vi) for any action or omission of Payment
Agent taken or made upon any instruction expressly provided for in this
Agreement, other than as the result of the bad faith, gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Payment Agent, (vii) for any action or omission of any
third party, including any other party hereto or any federal or state bank
regulator, and (viii) for any other action or omission of, or for errors in
judgment, by the Payment Agent under or in connection with this Agreement
taken or made in good faith and without gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

 



 

(b) Parent will indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless the Payment Agent
from and against any and all losses, liabilities, costs, damages or expenses,
including. without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses,
incurred or made, arising out of or in connection with the performance of the
Payment Agents obligations under the provisions of this Agreement, including
but not limited to, acting, or refusing to act in reliance upon any signature,
endorsement, assignment, certificate, order, request, notice, report, record,
instructions or other instrument or document believed by the Payment Agent in
good faith to be valid, genuine and sufficient; _provided_ , _however_ , such
indemnification shall not apply to any such act or omission resulting from the
willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Payment Agent. The indemnities
provided by this Section 5.5 shall survive the resignation or discharge of the
Payment Agent or the termination of this Agreement. Anything in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Payment Agent or Parent
be liable under or in connection with this Agreement for indirect, special,
incidental, punitive or consequential losses or damages of any kind
whatsoever, including but not limited to lost profits, whether or not
foreseeable, even if the Payment Agent or Parent has been advised of the
possibility thereof and regardless of the form of action in which such damages
are sought.

 



 

5.6 **Term.** Parent and the Payment Agent agree that this Agreement shall
terminate upon the later of: (a) written notice from the Securityholders
Representative, Parent or the Escrow Agent that all funds held in escrow
pursuant to the Indemnity and Adjustment Escrow Agreement have been disbursed
or (b) upon completion of all unclaimed property reporting and escheatment
obligations arising in connection with the Merger and the duties of the
Payment Agent pursuant to this Agreement. If, upon termination of this
Agreement, any Shares remain unexchanged or other payments remain unpaid and
moneys and/or securities on deposit hereunder are not escheatable in
accordance with unclaimed property laws and regulations, any remaining moneys,
securities and property shall be delivered by the Payment Agent to Parent.
Thereafter, Parent shall be responsible for compliance with unclaimed property
obligations. In the event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason
while any moneys and/or securities are on deposit hereunder, such moneys
and/or securities shall be delivered by the Payment Agent to Parent promptly
following such termination.

 



 

5.7 **Amendments.** No provision of this Agreement may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by the
Payment Agent, Parent and, in the case of an amendment or modification to any
Section other than Sections 3.6 and 4.1-4.5, the Securityholders
Representative; _provided_ , that each of Parent and the Securityholders
Representative may amend _Exhibit B_ (solely with respect to its authorized
persons set forth therein) at any time, and from time to time, upon

 



      
 

 



 

written notice to the Payment Agent and Parent or the Securityholders
Representative, as applicable. Any inconsistency between this Agreement, on
the one hand, and the Merger Agreement or the Letter of Transmittal, on the
other hand, shall be resolved in favor of the Merger Agreement or the Letter
of Transmittal, as applicable; _provided_ that (a) the Payment Agent is not a
party to the Merger Agreement and is not subject to its terms, and (b) the
rights and obligations of the Payment Agent shall be governed solely by the
provisions of this Agreement, without reference to the Merger Agreement. In
the absence of written notice from Parent to the effect that an inconsistency
exists between the Merger Agreement or Letter of Transmittal, on the one hand,
and this Agreement, on the other hand, the Payment Agent shall be entitled to
assume that no such inconsistency exists and shall not have any duty to
inquire as to the existence of any such inconsistency.

 



 

5.8 **Notices.** All notices to be given by any party to another party under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective (a) on the
date of delivery if made by personal delivery (including delivery by any
commercial delivery service); (b) three (3) days after deposit for delivery by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested; or
(c) on the date of delivery if sent by facsimile or electronic mail

5.9 **Counterparts and Severability.** This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, including by facsimile or electronic mail delivery of a
pdf file, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together
shall constitute one instrument. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
held illegal, invalid or unenforceable by any court, this Agreement shall be
construed and enforced as if such provision had not been contained herein and
shall be deemed binding and enforceable to the full extent permitted by
applicable law.

 



 

5.10 **Law; Waiver of Jury Trial.** This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the non-exclusive
jurisdiction and laws of the State of Delaware. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
EXPRESSLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESOLVING ANY CLAIM OR
COUNTERCLAIM RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

5.11 **Assignment; Resignation of Securityholders Representative.**

 



 

(a) This Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto without prior
written consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ that (i) the
Securityholders Representative may assign its rights under this Agreement to
any successor Securityholders Representative elected or selected to replace it
in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement without the consent of
any party hereto, so long as the replacement Securityholders representative
shall agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement as fully
as if it were an original signatory hereto, and (ii) Parent may assign any or
all of its rights under this Agreement to any one or more Securityholders
without the consent of any party hereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time
the Securityholders Representative shall have resigned and no replacement
Securityholders Representative shall have been designated in accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement:

 



 

(i) any requirement in this Agreement to deliver notice to the Securityholders
Representative shall be deemed to be satisfied upon the delivery of notice to
each of the Securityholders at the applicable addresses set forth on _Schedule
A_ ; and

 



 

(ii) Parent may take any action that is to be taken by the Securityholders
Representative or that requires the consent or approval of the Securityholders
Representative pursuant to this Agreement if (1) Parent delivers written
notice of its intention to take such action to the Payment Agent and each of
the Securityholders at the applicable addresses set forth on _Schedule A_ and
(2) within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of such written notice,
Parent does not receive written notice from a replacement Securityholders
Representative appointed in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement
objecting to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, taking such
action; _provided_ , that, if Parents or the Surviving Corporations
inability to take the applicable action prior to the delivery of notice to the
Securityholders or the expiration of such fifteen-Business Day period would
materially prejudice the rights of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, then
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, may, in good faith, take
such action and thereafter shall deliver prompt written notice thereof to the
Securityholders.

 



 

5.12 **Payment Matter**. In the event that Payment Agent makes any payment to
any party pursuant to this Agreement and for any reason such payment (or any
portion thereof) is required to be returned to any account or fund hereunder
or to another party or is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent
or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a receiver, trustee
or other party under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, other federal or state
law, common law or equitable doctrine, then the recipient shall repay to
Payment Agent upon written request the amount so paid to it. [NTD: Is this a
provision required by the Payment Agent?]

 



 

5.13 **Compliance with Orders**. Payment Agent shall comply with judgments or
orders issued or process entered by any court with respect to the funds held
by it hereunder, including, without limitation, any attachment, levy or
garnishment, without any obligation to determine such courts jurisdiction in
the matter and in accordance with its normal business practices. If the
Payment Agent complies with any such judgment, order or process, then it shall
not be liable to any party hereto or any other person by reason of such
compliance, regardless of the final disposition of any such judgment, order or
process.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 6**

 



 

 **CONFIDENTIAL DATA**

 



 

6.1 **Confidential Data.** Each of the Payment Agent, the Securityholders
Representative and Parent acknowledges that during the term of this Agreement,
the parties hereto may make confidential data available to each other or may
otherwise obtain proprietary or confidential information regarding Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, the Securityholders and the Payment
Agent (collectively, hereinafter " ** _Confidential Data_** "). Confidential
Data includes all information not publicly available and includes, but is not
limited to, (a) data or information which identifies past, current or
potential customers, stockholders, business practices, financial results,
research, development, systems and plans, (b) any information and material
identified by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Payment Agent or
Parent as "Proprietary" or "Confidential"; (c) data the Payment Agent
furnishes to Parent from the Payment Agents database, and/or (d) data
received from the Company, the Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation or Parent and enhanced by the Payment Agent. Confidential Data may
be written, oral, recorded, or maintained on other forms of electronic media.

 



 

6.2 **Relief.** Each of the Payment Agent, the Securityholders Representative
and Parent acknowledges that all Confidential Data furnished to the other
party is considered proprietary and strictly confidential. Each of the Payment
Agent, the Securityholders Representative and Parent acknowledges that the
unauthorized use or disclosure of any Confidential Data may cause irreparable
harm to the other party. Accordingly, each of the Payment Agent, the
Securityholders Representative and Parent agrees that the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Payment Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including injunctive relief, in addition to all other
remedies available at law for any threatened or actual breach of this Article
6 or any threatened or actual unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential
Data.

 



 

6.3 **Security Measures.** The Payment Agent will employ the same security
measures to protect Confidential Data received from the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent that it would employ for its own comparable confidential
information (but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care in handling
Confidential Data). Without limiting the foregoing, the Payment Agent further
agrees, subject to applicable law and regulations, that: (i) Confidential Data
shall not be distributed, disclosed, or conveyed to any third party except by
prior written approval of Parent; (ii) no copies or reproductions shall be
made of any Confidential Data, except as needed to provide the services
described in this Agreement; and (iii) the Payment Agent shall not use any
Confidential Data for its own benefit or for the benefit of any third party.

 



 

6.4 **Subpoena, Summons or Legal Process.** Except as prohibited by applicable
law or regulation, the Payment Agent shall promptly notify Parent in writing
of any subpoena, summons or other legal process served on the Payment Agent
for the purpose of obtaining Confidential Data. In such cases, Parent shall
have a reasonable opportunity to seek appropriate protective measures;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 6.4 shall not require the Payment
Agent to notify Parent of its receipt of any subpoena, summons or other legal
process if the Payment Agent is prohibited by law or regulation from making
such disclosure.

 



 

6.5 **Exceptions.** The obligations set forth in Sections 6.1 through 6.4
above shall not apply to:

 



 

(a) any disclosure specifically authorized in writing by Parent;

 



 

(b) any disclosure required by applicable law or regulation or stock exchange,
including pursuant to a court order; or

 



 

(c) Confidential Data which:

 



 

(i) has become public without violation of this Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) was disclosed to the Payment Agent or Parent by a third party not under
an obligation of confidentiality to any party hereto; or

 



 

(iii) was independently developed by the Payment Agent not otherwise in
violation or breach of this Agreement or any other obligation of the parties
to each other; or

 



 

(iv) was rightfully known to the Payment Agent prior to entering into this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

6.6 **Obligations Beyond Termination or Assignment.** The obligations of each
party set forth in Sections 6.1 through 6.4 above shall survive termination or
assignment of this Agreement.

 



 

6.7 **Compliance.** The Payment Agents appointment and acceptance of its
duties under this Agreement is contingent upon verification of all regulatory
requirements applicable to the Company and Parent, including successful
completion of a final background check. These conditions include, without
limitation, requirements under the USA Patriot Act Customer Identification
Program (CIP), the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and the U.S. Department of the
Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), each as may be amended from
time to time. If these conditions are not met, the Payment Agent may at its
option promptly terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, and without the
Payment Agent having any liability or incurring any additional costs.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

Pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of May 12, 2011, as such agreement may amended from time to time (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), by and among Constellation Energy Resources, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Parent_ "), Nutmeg Merger Sub, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
"), MXenergy Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and
joined by Mx SR LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, solely in its
capacity as securityholders representative (" _Securityholders Representative_
"), among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "). In connection with, and effective upon consummation of the
Merger, the undersigned, who is (a) a holder of stock certificates
representing shares of class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the " _Class A Common Shares_"), or (b) a holder of stock
certificates representing shares of class C common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the " _Class C Common Shares_" and, together with the
Class A Common Shares, collectively the " _Shares_ "), surrenders the
Certificates (as defined below) to the Paying Agent (as indicated under
"DESCRIPTION OF CERTIFICATES SURRENDERED" below) in exchange for cash
consideration which shall be calculated and payable in the manner and at the
times set forth in the Merger Agreement as described further below. Holders of
Class A Common Shares and Class C Common Shares are referred to herein
individually as a " _Stockholder_ " and collectively, as the " _Stockholders_
". Stock certificates representing the Shares are referred to herein as the "
_Certificates_ ". Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

The undersigned understands, acknowledges and agrees that, pursuant to and as
more fully described in the Merger Agreement, (1) the Merger Consideration has
been deposited with the Paying Agent at the closing of the Merger and (2) a
portion of the remaining cash consideration to be paid to the Stockholders
with respect to the Shares and the holders of Company Restricted Share Units
in an amount equal to the sum of the Fixed Escrow Amount, plus the Adjustment
Escrow Amount plus the Securityholders Representative Escrow Amount (such sum,
the " _Escrow Amount_ ") has been deposited in one or more escrow accounts
with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, in its capacity as escrow agent
(the " _Escrow Agent_ "), in order to satisfy, among other things, certain
indemnification obligations of the Stockholders and the holders of Company
Restricted Share Units pursuant to _Article XI_ of the Merger Agreement and
to cover certain post-Closing purchase price adjustments and the fees and
expenses of the Securityholders Representative and the Escrow Agent. The
amounts deposited with the Escrow Agent, together with any interest,
investment income or other proceeds applicable thereto, shall be held by the
Escrow Agent, subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement and
the Securityholders Representative Escrow Agreement. The undersigned will be
entitled to receive any portion of the Escrow Amount that is hereafter
distributed to the Stockholders and the holders of Company Restricted Share
Units, if any, in proportion to the undersigneds percentage share of the
Fully Diluted Common Stock. Funds released from escrow, if any, will be mailed
to the undersigned by the Paying Agent at the address set forth below (or at
such other address as is provided by the undersigned to the Paying Agent,
Parent and the Securityholders Representative in writing not less than five
(5) days prior to such release) promptly following its release. The
undersigned acknowledges that indemnification

 



      
 

 



 

claims and other claims made on the Escrow Amount may delay or preclude the
release of some or all of the Escrow Amount to the undersigned.

 



 

 **Please note that backup withholding taxes may be withheld from payments
made for the surrender of the Certificates representing the Shares if the
undersigned does not complete the substitute Form W-9 provided below in
accordance with the guidelines attached to this Letter of Transmittal or
provide a properly completed Form W-8BEN (or other appropriate Form W-8),
whichever is applicable.**

 



 

 **The undersigned must surrender the Certificates to the Paying Agent in
connection with the delivery of this Letter of Transmittal. In the event that
the Certificates have been lost, destroyed or stolen the Stockholder shall
complete a Certificate Affidavit in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
in lieu of surrendering the Certificates, shall make a $100 payment to the
Paying Agent, and shall furnish an indemnity bond in an amount providing
coverage for the total amount of the consideration to be received by the
undersigned for such lost, destroyed or stolen Certificates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the undersigned be required to pay more
than 5% of the total amount of the consideration which may be received by the
undersigned for the lost, destroyed or stolen Certificates in order to obtain
such indemnity bond (or such lesser amount as Parent may reasonably agree to),
and in the event the cost of such indemnity bond would exceed 5%, then the
undersigned shall purchase an indemnity bond providing the maximum amount of
coverage that may be purchased for a price equal to 5% of the total amount of
the consideration which may be received by the undersigned for the lost,
destroyed or stolen Certificates. (See Instruction 7 of Annex 1)**

Agent, and covenants and agrees with the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the

(a) The undersigned has the right, power, authority and capacity to execute,

authorized by all necessary action on the part of the undersigned. This Letter
of Transmittal has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
undersigned and constitutes the undersigneds valid and binding obligation,
enforceable in accordance with its terms and conditions, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

(b) The undersigned holds good and valid title to the Shares surrendered
hereby and either (i) has record ownership of the Shares and the Certificates
representing such Shares, if applicable, set forth under the "DESCRIPTION OF
CERTIFICATES SURRENDERED" or (ii) if the Shares are registered in a name other

_Liens_ "), with no defects of title whatsoever. Except for any rights, if
any, held by the spouse of the undersigned, who has consented to this transfer
of Shares with his or her signature on the Spousal Consent included with this
Letter of Transmittal, the undersigned has the

 



      
 

 



 

exclusive right, power and authority to vote and surrender the Shares owned by

The undersigned will, upon request, execute and deliver any additional
documents reasonably requested by Parent and the Paying Agent in connection
with the surrender of the Certificates.

 



 

The undersigned hereby acknowledges that delivery of the Certificates
identified above shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Shares
represented by such Certificates shall pass, only (a) if the Merger has been
consummated and (b) upon proper delivery of this Letter of Transmittal and any
Certificates or any Certificate Affidavit (as applicable) to the Paying Agent.
The undersigned understands that surrender is not made in acceptable form
until receipt by the Paying Agent of this Letter of Transmittal, or a
facsimile hereof, duly completed and signed. All questions as to validity,
form and eligibility of any surrender of any Certificates hereunder shall be
determined by Parent and the Paying Agent, and such determination shall be
final and binding on all parties.

 



 

The undersigned understands that after the Merger has been consummated,
payment of the cash consideration for the Shares represented by the
surrendered Certificates will be made in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement.

 



 

All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall survive the
death or incapacity of the undersigned, and any obligation of the undersigned
hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, personal
representatives, trustees in bankruptcy, successors and assigns of the
undersigned.

If the Shares to be tendered hereby are registered in the name of two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile hereof).

 



 

If this Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile hereof) is signed by the
registered Stockholder listed and tendered hereby and the cash consideration
issued in exchange therefor is to be issued to such holder, such holder need

In any other case, such holder must either properly endorse the Shares
tendered or transmit a properly completed separate power with this Letter of

must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate powers, in each case signed as
the name of the registered Stockholder appears on the Certificates.

 



 

If this Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile hereof) or any Shares or powers
are signed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-
fact, officers of corporations or others acting in a fiduciary or
representative capacity, such persons should so indicate when signing, and,
unless waived by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, evidence
satisfactory to the Company or the Surviving Corporation of such persons
authority to act must be submitted with this Letter of Transmittal.

 



 

Endorsements on Shares or signatures on powers required by this Instruction 2
must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution that is a member of or
participates in the Security Transfer Agent Medallion Program or such other

* such Shares are tendered for the account of an Eligible Institution.

 



 

In all other cases, all signatures on this Letter of Transmittal (or facsimile
hereof) must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution that is a member of or
participates in the Security Transfer Agent Medallion Program or such other
signature guarantee program as may be acceptable to the Company.

 



 

 **If any of the Shares listed and tendered hereby are held of record by two
or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal.**

 



 

 **If any of the tendered Shares are registered in different names on several
Certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign, and submit as many
separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations of
Certificates surrendered.**

 



 

3. _Payment and Special Delivery Instructions_. Indicate the name and address to which payment of the cash consideration for the Shares is to be sent if different from the name or address of the person or persons signing this Letter of Transmittal.

In addition, a Stockholder must complete a Certificate Affidavit in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ before receiving any consideration for his, hers or its Shares if such Stockholder is not delivering a Certificate with this Letter of Transmittal.

 



 

The Stockholder should promptly notify the Paying Agent, at the address listed

 **IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION**

 



 

 **Purpose of Substitute Form W-9**

 



 

If you are a U.S. Person (defined below), to prevent backup withholding on any
payments that may be made to you, you are required to notify the Paying Agent
of your correct taxpayer identification number. To do this, you should
complete the substitute Form W-9 provided above by filling in your name and
address in the space provided, filling in your taxpayer identification number
in Part I of the Form (or writing "Applied For" if you are awaiting a taxpayer
identification number and completing the box entitled "CERTIFICATE OF AWAITING
TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER"), crossing out Item 2 of the certification
where and if applicable, indicating your exempt status, if applicable, by
checking the box in Part II, and signing and dating the Form at the bottom. By
doing so you will be certifying that the taxpayer identification number
provided on Substitute Form W-9 is correct (or that you are awaiting a
taxpayer identification number) and that (1) you are exempt from backup
withholding, (2) you have not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service
that you are subject to backup withholding as a result of failure to report
all interest or dividends or (3) you have been notified by the Internal
Revenue Service that you are no longer subject to backup withholding. See the
enclosed "Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on
Substitute Form W-9" for additional instructions. For purposes of the
substitute Form W-9, a U.S. Person is an individual who is a U.S. citizen or
U.S. resident alien, a partnership, corporation, company, or association
created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United
States, or any political subdivision thereof, an estate (other than a foreign
estate) or a domestic trust.

 



 

If you are not a U.S. Person, you should not complete a substitute Form W-9.
Instead, to avoid backup withholding, you should complete an IRS Form W-8BEN
(or other appropriate type of IRS Form W-8). In the case of Non-U.S. Person
for which IRS Form W-8BEN is the appropriate form, IRS Form W-8BEN requires a
Non-U.S. Person to provide such Non-U.S. Persons name and address, along with
certain other information, and to certify, under penalties of perjury, that
such Non-U.S. Person is not a U.S. Person. Non-U.S. Persons may obtain an IRS
Form W-8BEN and instructions (or other appropriate IRS Form W-8) from the
IRSs website (http://www.irs.gov).

 



 

 **What Number to Set Forth**

 



 

You should provide the social security number (if an individual) or employer
identification number of the record owner of the Shares surrendered hereby in
the space provided on Part I of the Substitute Form W-9. If the Shares are in
more than one name or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the
enclosed "Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on
Substitute Form W-9" for additional guidelines on which number to report.

 



 

 **Failure to include a properly completed substitute Form W-9 or IRS Form
W-8BEN (or other appropriate IRS Form W-8) may result in the application of
U.S. backup withholding.**

 **Obtaining a Number**

 



 

If you do not have a taxpayer identification number, apply for one
immediately. To apply for an SSN, obtain Form SS-5, Application for a Social
Security Card, from your local Social Security Administration office or get
this form online at www.socialsecurity.gov/online/ss-5.pdf. You may also get
this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS
Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for an ITIN, or Form SS-4,
Application for Employer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN. You can
apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website at
www.irs.gov/businesses/ and clicking on Employer ID Numbers under Starting a
Business. You can get Forms W-7 and SS-4 from the IRS by visiting www.irs.gov
or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676).

 



 

To complete the Substitute Form W-9 if you do not have a TIN, write "Applied
For" in the space provided for the TIN, complete the Certificate of Awaiting
Taxpayer Identification Number, sign and date the form and return it to the
Paying Agent. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made
with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days
to get a TIN and give it to the Paying Agent before you are subject to backup
withholding on payments. The 60 day rule does not apply to other types of
payments. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such payments until
provide your TIN to the Paying Agent.

 



 

Note: Writing "Applied For" means that you have already applied for a TIN or
that you intend to apply for one soon.

Payees specifically exempted from backup withholding on ALL payments include
the following:

"EXEMPT" IN PART II OF THE FORM AND RETURN IT TO THE PAYER. IF YOU ARE A
NONRESIDENT ALIEN OR A FOREIGN ENTITY NOT SUBJECT TO BACKUP WITHHOLDING, FILE
WITH PAYER AN APPROPRIATE COMPLETED IRS FORM W-8.

 



 

Payments that are not subject to information reporting also are not subject to
backup withholding. For details, see sections 6041, 6041A(a), 6042, 6044,
6045, 6049, 6050A, 6050N and their regulations.

 



 

 **Privacy Act Notice**.Section 6109 requires most recipients of dividend,
interest or other payments to give taxpayer identification numbers to payers
who must report the payments to the IRS. The IRS uses the number for
identification purposes and to help verify the accuracy of tax returns. The
IRS also may provide this information to the Department of Justice for civil
and criminal litigation and to cities, states, and the District of Columbia to
carry out their tax laws. The IRS may also disclose this information to other
countries under a tax treaty, to federal and state agencies to enforce federal
non-tax criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies
to combat

      
 

 



 

terrorism. Payers must be given the numbers whether or not recipients are
required to file tax returns. Payers must generally withhold 28% of taxable
interest, dividends and certain other payments to a payee who does not furnish
a taxpayer identification number to a payer. Certain penalties may also apply.

 



 

 **Penalties**

 



 

 **(1)** ** ****Penalty for Failure to Furnish Taxpayer Identification
Number.** If you fail to furnish your taxpayer identification number to a
payer, you are subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your
failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

 

 **(2)** ** ****Civil Penalty for False Information With Respect to
Withholding.** If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis which
results in no imposition of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty
of $500.

 

 **(3)** ** ****Criminal Penalty for Falsifying Information.** Willfully
falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal
penalties including fines and/or imprisonment.

of attorney or other authorization respecting same which is now outstanding
and in force, or otherwise disposed of the same; and no person, firm,
corporation, agency or government other than Stockholder has or has asserted
any right, title, claim, equity, or interest in, to or respecting the
Certificate or the proceeds thereof.

 



 

2. The Stockholder does hereby further agree as follows:

 



 

a. That this Affidavit of Loss and Indemnity Agreement is being executed by
the Stockholder for the purpose of documenting and verifying for the Paying
Agent that the Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed and inducing the
Paying Agent, (i) to refuse to recognize any person other than Stockholder as
the owner of the Certificate, (ii) to refuse to make any payment, transfer,
registration, delivery or exchange called for by or with respect to the
Certificate to any person other than Stockholder, (iii) to refuse to take any
other action pursuant to the request or demand of any duplicate or definitive
security or other instrument in substitution for the Certificate and (iv) to

b. That the Stockholder will immediately surrender to the Paying Agent the
Certificate, should the Certificate hereafter come into the possession or
control of the Stockholder;

 



 

c. That the Stockholder will at all times protect, indemnify and hold harmless
each of the Paying Agent, Parent and their respective subsidiaries and related

 



      
 

 



 

companies, each person, firm or corporation now or hereafter acting as the
Companys transfer agent, registrar, attorney or paying agent, or in any other
capacity, and each of their respective successors and assigns (collectively,

or in consequence of the Certificates having been destroyed, lost or stolen,
such indemnity extending to and including, but not being limited to, any
expense, loss, or other matter or any litigation or other expenditures in any
way arising from or connected with, directly or indirectly, the Certificates
or arising out of compliance with the request of the Stockholder herein set
forth, and the Stockholder further agrees to furnish to the above named
Indemnitees or any of them, without any expense to them, a bond of indemnity,
in such form as said Indemnitees or any of them may require and in an amount
not greater than the aggregate consideration to be received in respect of the
Certificates, with satisfactory surety or sureties if this agreement of
indemnity should not at any time for any reason in the opinion of said
Indemnitees or any of them afford sufficient protection; _provided_ that the
Stockholders cost of obtaining the required bond shall in no event exceed 5%
of the total amount of consideration which may be received by the Stockholder
for the shares represented by the Certificates; and

 



 

d. That the agreement by the Stockholder to indemnify the Indemnitees shall be
binding upon the Stockholders successors and assigns and shall inure to the
benefit of the Indemnitees.

A. **_Cancellation of Restricted Share Units_**.

 



 

1. The undersigned holder (the " _RSU Holder_ ") of RSUs (as defined in Section B.1 below) hereby acknowledges that, pursuant to _Section 4.1(d)_ of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of May 12, 2011, by and among the Company, Parent, Nutmeg Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and joined by Mx SR LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in its capacity as securityholders representative (the " _Securityholders Representative_ "), the RSUs will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash consideration in an amount equal to the Common Share Price (as defined in the Merger Agreement), payable in accordance with the Merger Agreement and Section B below, less applicable federal, state and local income tax withholding and Social Security, Medicare, state disability, unemployment and other withholding obligations (collectively, the " _Tax Obligations_ "), subject to and following the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), all on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to _Section 5.4_ **** of the Merger Agreement, receipt of such consideration by the RSU Holder will be subject to the receipt by Parent, the Company and Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, a New York state chartered commercial bank (the " _Paying Agent_ "), of this Restricted Share Unit Surrender Agreement (the " _Surrender Agreement_ ") executed by the undersigned RSU Holder. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement, a copy of which has been provided to the RSU Holder.

 



 

2. The RSU Holder further agrees that any restricted share unit agreements previously entered into between the Company and the RSU Holder (the " _RSU Award Agreements_ ") shall be automatically terminated as of the Effective Time with no further obligations of the Company thereunder except as provided herein and in the Merger Agreement. The RSU Holder further acknowledges that the RSU Holder is aware of the terms of the Merger and does hereby waive all requirements under the Equity Compensation Plan (as defined in Section B.1 below) and any RSU Award Agreements heretofore entered into by the RSU Holder in respect of notice to be given by the Company in connection with the Merger or in respect of any action otherwise required thereunder by the Company, and by execution of this Surrender Agreement hereby waives and relinquishes any and all right to receive consideration for the RSUs other than as provided herein and in the Merger Agreement. The RSU

the procedures described herein, and the acceptance thereof, will constitute a
binding agreement between the RSU Holder and the Surviving Corporation upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement and this
Surrender Agreement.

1. In exchange for an amount in cash equal to the Common Share Price (which shall be calculated and payable in the manner and at the times set forth in the Merger Agreement), less applicable Tax Obligations, the RSU Holder hereby surrenders for cancellation to the Company all of the RSU Holders right, title and interest in and to all restricted share units (the " _RSUs"_ ) settleable in shares (the " _Shares_ ") of Class C **** common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), of the Company pursuant to the provisions of the MXenergy Holdings Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the " _Equity Compensation Plan_ "), such RSUs of the RSU Holder being listed on the Schedule of Ownership (the " _Ownership Schedule_ ") attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, in exchange for, in respect of each RSU, an amount in cash which shall be calculated and payable in the manner and at the times set forth in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

2. The RSU Holder understands, acknowledges and agrees that, pursuant to and as more fully described in the Merger Agreement, a portion of the cash consideration to be paid to the Stockholders and the holders of RSUs in an amount equal to the sum of the Fixed Escrow Amount, plus the Adjustment Escrow Amount, plus the Securityholders Representative Escrow Amount (such sum, the " _Escrow Amount_ ") will be deposited in one or more escrow accounts with the Paying Agent, in its capacity as escrow agent (in such capacity, the " _Escrow Agent_ "), in order to satisfy, among other things, certain indemnification obligations of the Stockholders and the holders of RSUs pursuant to _Article XI_ of the Merger Agreement and to cover certain post-Closing purchase price adjustments and the fees and expenses of the Securityholders Representative and the Escrow Agent. The amounts deposited with the Escrow Agent, together with any interest, investment income or other proceeds applicable thereto, shall be held by the Escrow Agent, subject to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement and the Securityholders Representative Escrow Agreement. The undersigned RSU Holder will be entitled to receive any portion of the Escrow Amount that is distributed to the Stockholders and the holders of RSUs, if any, in proportion to the undersigned RSU Holderss percentage share of the Fully Diluted Common Stock, less applicable Tax Obligations. The undersigned RSU Holder acknowledges that indemnification claims and other claims made on the Escrow Amount may delay or preclude the release of some or all of the Escrow Amount to the undersigned RSU Holder.

 



 

3. The RSU Holder acknowledges that all payments to be made pursuant to this Surrender Agreement and the Merger Agreement will be made as follows:

 



 

(a) the Closing Common Share Price, less applicable Tax Obligations, will be
paid by the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or, if requested by the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent) on or immediately following the
Closing Date (or, if later, upon delivery of a duly executed Surrender
Agreement to the Surviving Corporation); and

 



 

(b) any remaining portion of the Common Share Price that may become payable to
the Securityholders pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, less
applicable Tax Obligations, will be paid by the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Surviving Corporations receipt of the funds from
the Paying Agent pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement or, at the request of
the Surviving Corporation, by the Paying Agent.

 



 

4. Payments to be made by the Paying Agent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation will be made by delivery of a check to the RSU Holder at the address set forth below, or, if the RSU Holder is employed by the Company or the Surviving Corporation at the time of such payment and the Company or the Surviving Corporation makes the payment directly, in accordance with payroll practices, including by automatic deposit.

 



 

5. The RSU Holder further (i) acknowledges that all payments to be made pursuant to this Surrender Agreement and the Merger Agreement are subject to the Tax Obligations applicable to compensatory payments of supplemental wages (which shall be reported to the RSU Holder as supplemental wages on Form W-2, or 1099-Misc, if applicable, as income for the calendar year in which payment to the RSU Holder occurs as set forth in Section B3 above), and (ii) represents that backup withholding therefor is not required with respect to such payments.

and delivering this Surrender Agreement (including the spousal consent signed

2. The RSU Holder is the record owner of the RSUs surrendered hereby and has not transferred or assigned such RSUs to any other Person. The RSUs owned by the

charges, pledges, security interests, options, rights of first refusal or
other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), other
than Liens pursuant to the RSU Award Agreement or the Equity Compensation
Plan. Subject to the terms of the RSU Award Agreement and the Equity
Compensation Plan, the undersigned RSU Holder has the exclusive right, power
and authority to transfer or surrender the RSUs owned by the RSU Holder.
Except for the Equity Compensation Plan and the RSU Holders RSU Award
Agreement, the RSU Holder is not a party to, or bound by, any agreement
affecting or relating to the RSU Holders right to transfer or surrender the
RSUs owned by the RSU Holder.

 



 

3. The RSU Holder acknowledges that he or she has received a copy of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

4. As contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the undersigned hereby makes, constitutes and accepts the appointment of Mx SR LLC as Securityholders Representative (acting by or through any one or more of its officers), and any replacement or successor to the Securityholders Representative appointed in accordance with _Section 2.4_ of the Merger Agreement, as the undersigneds representative for and in the undersigneds name, place, and stead and for its use and benefit, to act on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, _Section 2.4_, _Article V_ and _Article XI_ thereof, and to prepare, execute, certify, acknowledge, swear to, file, deliver, or record any and all agreements, instruments or other documents, and to take any and all actions, that are within the scope and authority of the Securityholders Representative as provided for and described in _Section 2.4_ of the Merger Agreement. This grant of authority (i) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of the undersigned and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive until all funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account, Fixed Escrow Account and the Securityholders Representative Escrow Account have been distributed.

 **IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION**

 



 

 **Purpose of Substitute Form W-9**

 



 

If you are a U.S. Person (defined below), to prevent backup withholding on any
payments that may be made to you, you are required to notify the Paying Agent
of your correct taxpayer identification number. To do this, you should
complete the substitute Form W-9 provided above by filling in your name and
address in the space provided, filling in your taxpayer identification number
in Part I of the Form (or writing "Applied For" if you are awaiting a taxpayer
identification number and completing the box entitled "CERTIFICATE OF AWAITING
TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER"), crossing out Item 2 of the certification
where and if applicable, indicating your exempt status, if applicable, by
checking the box in Part II, and signing and dating the Form at the bottom. By
doing so you will be certifying that the taxpayer identification number
provided on Substitute Form W-9 is correct (or that you are awaiting a
taxpayer identification number) and that (1) you are exempt from backup
withholding, (2) you have not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service
that you are subject to backup withholding as a result of failure to report
all interest or dividends or (3) you have been notified by the Internal
Revenue Service that you are no longer subject to backup withholding. See the
enclosed "Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on
Substitute Form W-9" for additional instructions. For purposes of the
substitute Form W-9, a U.S. Person is an individual who is a U.S. citizen or
U.S. resident alien, a partnership, corporation, company, or association
created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United
States, or any political subdivision thereof, an estate (other than a foreign
estate) or a domestic trust.

 



 

If you are not a U.S. Person, you should not complete a substitute Form W-9.
Instead, to avoid backup withholding, you should complete an IRS Form W-8BEN
(or other appropriate type of IRS Form W-8). In the case of Non-U.S. Person
for which IRS Form W-8BEN is the appropriate form, IRS Form W-8BEN requires a
Non-U.S. Person to provide such Non-U.S. Persons name and address, along with
certain other information, and to certify, under penalties of perjury, that
such Non-U.S. Person is not a U.S. Person. Non-U.S. Persons may obtain an IRS
Form W-8BEN and instructions (or other appropriate IRS Form W-8) from the
IRSs website (http://www.irs.gov).

 



 

 **What Number to Set Forth**

 



 

You should provide the social security number (if an individual) or employer
identification number of the record owner of the Shares surrendered hereby in
the space provided on Part I of the Substitute Form W-9. If the Shares are in
more than one name or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the
enclosed "Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on
Substitute Form W-9" for additional guidelines on which number to report.

 



 

 **Failure to include a properly completed substitute Form W-9 or IRS Form
W-8BEN (or other appropriate IRS Form W-8) may result in the application of
U.S. backup withholding.**

 



      
 

 



 

 **GUIDELINES FOR CERTIFICATION OF TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION**

 



 

 **NUMBER ON SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9**

 



 

 **Guidelines for Determining the Proper Identification Number to Give the
Payer**. Social Security numbers have nine digits separated by two hyphens:
i.e., 000-00-0000. Employer identification numbers have nine digits separated
by only one hyphen: i.e., 00-0000000. The table below will help determine the
number to give the payer.

 **GUIDELINES FOR CERTIFICATION OF TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION**

 



 

 **NUMBER ON SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9**

 



 

 **Obtaining a Number**

 



 

If you do not have a taxpayer identification number, apply for one
immediately. To apply for an SSN, obtain Form SS-5, Application for a Social
Security Card, from your local Social Security Administration office or get
this form online at www.socialsecurity.gov/online/ss-5.pdf. You may also get
this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS
Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for an ITIN, or Form SS-4,
Application for Employer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN. You can
apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website at
www.irs.gov/businesses/ and clicking on Employer ID Numbers under Starting a
Business. You can get Forms W-7 and SS-4 from the IRS by visiting www.irs.gov
or by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676).

 



 

To complete the Substitute Form W-9 if you do not have a TIN, write "Applied
For" in the space provided for the TIN, complete the Certificate of Awaiting
Taxpayer Identification Number, sign and date the form and return it to the
Paying Agent. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made
with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days
to get a TIN and give it to the Paying Agent before you are subject to backup
withholding on payments. The 60 day rule does not apply to other types of
payments. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such payments until
providing your TIN to the Paying Agent.

 



 

Note: Writing "Applied For" means that you have already applied for a TIN or
that you intend to apply for one soon.

 



 

 **Payees Exempt From Backup Withholding**

 



 

Payees specifically exempted from backup withholding on ALL payments include
the following:

 

* An organization exempt from tax under section 501(a), an individual retirement account, or a custodial account under section 403(b)(7) if the account satisfies the requirements of section 401(f)(2).

Exempt payees described above should file the Substitute Form W-9 to avoid

PAYER. FURNISH YOUR TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. CHECK THE BOX MARKED
"EXEMPT" IN PART II OF THE FORM AND RETURN IT TO THE PAYER. IF YOU ARE A
NONRESIDENT ALIEN OR A FOREIGN ENTITY NOT SUBJECT TO BACKUP WITHHOLDING, FILE
WITH PAYER AN APPROPRIATE COMPLETED IRS FORM W-8.

 



 

Payments that are not subject to information reporting also are not subject to
backup withholding. For details, see

 



      
 

 



 

sections 6041, 6041A(a), 6042, 6044, 6045, 6049, 6050A, 6050N and their
regulations.

 



 

 **Privacy Act Notice**.Section 6109 requires most recipients of dividend,
interest or other payments to give taxpayer identification numbers to payers
who must report the payments to the IRS. The IRS uses the number for
identification purposes and to help verify the accuracy of tax returns. The
IRS also may provide this information to the Department of Justice for civil
and criminal litigation and to cities, states, and the District of Columbia to
carry out their tax laws. The IRS may also disclose this information to other
countries under a tax treaty, to federal and state agencies to enforce federal
non-tax criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies
to combat terrorism. Payers must be given the numbers whether or not
recipients are required to file tax returns. Payers must generally withhold
28% of taxable interest, dividends and certain other payments to a payee who
does not furnish a taxpayer identification number to a payer. Certain
penalties may also apply.

 



 

 **Penalties**

 



 

 **(1)** ** ****Penalty for Failure to Furnish Taxpayer Identification
Number.** If you fail to furnish your taxpayer identification number to a
payer, you are subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your
failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

 



 

 **(2)** ** ****Civil Penalty for False Information With Respect to
Withholding.** If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis which
results in no imposition of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty
of $500.

 



 

 **(3)** ** ****Criminal Penalty for Falsifying Information.** Willfully
falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal
penalties including fines and/or imprisonment.
