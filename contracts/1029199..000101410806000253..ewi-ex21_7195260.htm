Date (the " _Final Balance Sheet_ "), which shall be prepared in the same
manner and form, and applying the same principles, as the Reference Balance
Sheet and which shall reflect by footnote or otherwise the adjustments
necessary to conform to the definition of Working Capital set forth herein. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but no later than
forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to the Buyer
the Final Balance Sheet and a statement certifying Sellers good faith
calculation of the Working Capital of the Business as of the Closing Date
(such statement, the " _Final Working Capital Statement_ ", and the Working
Capital set forth thereon, the " _Final Working Capital_ ").

 

(b) The Buyer and its independent certified public accountants may
review the Final Balance Sheet, the Final Working Capital Statement, the Final
Working Capital, the Preliminary Working Capital Statement and the Preliminary
Working Capital and may make inquiry of the representatives of Sellers
accountants and Seller. The Seller shall cooperate and assist, to the extent
reasonably requested by the Buyer and/or its independent accountants, in the
review of the Final Balance Sheet, the Final Working Capital Statement, the
Final Working Capital, the Preliminary Working Capital Statement and the
Preliminary Working Capital. If the Buyer disagrees with any aspect of the
Preliminary Working Capital and/or Final Working Capital calculations, the
Buyer shall contact Seller in writing to attempt to resolve the matter. The
Seller agrees to address in good faith Buyers concerns regarding the
calculations of the Preliminary Working Capital and/or Final Working Capital,
but has no obligation to agree with Buyer. The determination of the
Preliminary Working Capital and Final Working Capital shall be binding and
conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, the Buyer and Parent unless the Buyer
shall have notified Seller in writing no later than thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Final Working Capital Statement of any objection to the Final
Working Capital or to Preliminary Working Capital or both. A notice under this
Section 1.4(b) shall specify, in reasonable detail, the items in the
calculation that are being disputed, and the Buyer and Parent shall be deemed
to

 



 

12

  have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Preliminary
Working Capital Statement and Final Working Capital Statement, as applicable,
delivered by Seller.

 

(c) At the request of either party, any dispute between the parties
relating to the calculation of the Preliminary Working Capital and/or the
Final Working Capital that cannot be resolved by them within thirty (30) days
after receipt of notice of any objections to such calculation pursuant to
Section 1.4(b) shall be referred to a mutually agreeable auditor independent
of both parties for decision, which decision shall be final and binding on
both parties. In making such decision, such auditor shall consider only those
items or amounts on the Preliminary Working Capital Statement and/or the Final
Working Capital Statement as to which the Buyer has disagreed, and shall have
no authority to resolve any dispute other than with respect to the matters
specifically referred to in this Section 1.4. The parties agree that they
will request that the auditor render its decision within thirty (30) days
after referral of the dispute to the auditor for decision pursuant hereto. The
fee of the auditor for, and relating to, the making of any such decision shall
be borne by the parties equally.

 

(d) The Final Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Working Capital and the
Final Working Capital shall become final and binding on both parties hereto
upon the earliest of (i) the expiration of the period within which Seller may
notify the Buyer of any objections thereto pursuant to Section 1.4(b) if no
notice of objection has been given, (ii) agreement by Seller and the Buyer
that the Preliminary Working Capital and the Final Working Capital, together
with any modifications thereto agreed by Seller and the Buyer, shall be final
and binding, or (iii) the date on which the auditor shall issue its decision
with respect to any dispute relating to such calculation.

 

(e) Within five (5) days after the determination of the Preliminary
Working Capital and the Final Working Capital becomes final and binding on the
parties hereto pursuant to Section 1.4(d), if the Final Working Capital is
greater than the Preliminary Working Capital, the Buyer or Parent shall pay to
Seller the difference between the Final Working Capital and the Preliminary
Working Capital, and if the Final Working Capital is less than the Preliminary
Working Capital, Seller shall pay to the Buyer the difference between the
Final Working Capital and the Preliminary Working Capital; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Buyer nor Seller shall have any obligation to
make a payment pursuant to this Section 1.4(e) if the difference between the
Preliminary Working Capital and the Final Working Capital is less than or
equal to two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) (it being understood that if
the difference between the Preliminary Working Capital and the Final Working
Capital exceeds two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000), then the Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, shall be obligated to make a payment equal only to
two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) plus the amount of the excess over two
hundred thousand dollars ($200,000)). All payments under this Section 1.4(e)
shall be by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the party receiving payment.

 

1.5 _Adjustment of Parent Common Stock_. If, between the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Closing, the Parent Common Stock is
recapitalized or reclassified, or any stock dividend, stock split, or reverse
stock split of the Parent Common Stock occurs or Parent merges, consolidates,
reorganizes or enters into another business combination with any Person or
sells or exchanges all or substantially all of its assets, in a transaction in
which the Parent Common

 



 

13

  Stock is exchanged for securities of such Person, then the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be delivered as the Stock Purchase Price under Section 1.3(a)
(including those shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under the CVRs and the
Appreciation Rights) will be appropriately and equitably adjusted to the kind
and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property to which the
holders of those shares of the Parent Common Stock would have been entitled
had the stock been issued and outstanding as of the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to participate in that corporate event. To
the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that such Person
assumes the obligations set forth in this Agreement. The provisions of this
Section 1.5 will apply to successive mergers, consolidations, reorganizations,
and combinations.

 

1.6 _Exemption from Registration; Legended Certificates_. The shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued to Seller hereunder (including those
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under the CVRs and the Appreciation
Rights), the CVRs and the Appreciation Rights will be issued in a transaction
exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), by reason of Section 4(2) thereof and/or Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act and such securities may not be re-offered
or resold or otherwise transferred other than in conformity with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable Laws or
pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The certificates issued by Parent with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issued hereunder (including
those shares of Parent Common Stock issuable under the CVRs and the
Appreciation Rights) and any certificates or instruments representing the CVRs
and the Appreciation Rights will be legended to the effect described above and
will include such additional legends as necessary to comply with applicable
U.S. federal securities Laws and Blue Sky Laws.

_Registration Rights_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but in no
event later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, subject to receipt
of information regarding the Seller required to be included therein, Parent
shall prepare and file a "shelf" registration statement with respect to the
resale of the shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to Seller as the Stock
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.3(a) above (including those shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable under the CVRs and the Appreciation Rights, but
not the CVRs and Appreciation Rights themselves) (the "Registrable Shares")
(which term includes any securities into which or for which such shares may
hereafter be changed, converted or exchanged, and any other shares or
securities issued with respect to such shares to the Seller), on an
appropriate form for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Shelf Registration Statement"), in order to enable the resale of
the Registrable Shares by each Seller from time to time through the automated
quotation system of the Nasdaq Global Market (or such other national
securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities
association in the United States on which the shares of Parent Common Stock
are then principally traded). Parent shall use best efforts to cause the Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable
thereafter, and to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously
effective (subject to any Suspension or Blackout Period) (each as defined
below) for a period ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which each Seller
could sell all Registrable Shares then held by such Seller in one transaction
without restriction by the volume limitations of Rule 144(e) under the
Securities Act or (ii) when all Registrable Shares covered by the Shelf
Registration Statement have been sold pursuant

 



 

14

  thereto. Unless Seller shall consent in writing, no other party, including
Parent, shall be permitted to offer securities under any such Shelf
Registration Statement. In the event that Parent fails to file, or if filed
fails to use best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be
declared effective as soon as practicable thereafter and, upon effectiveness,
to maintain the effectiveness (subject to any Suspension or Blackout Period)
of, the Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, Seller may make a written request for a Demand Registration (as
defined below) pursuant to Section 1.7(b); provided, that if and so long as
the Shelf Registration Statement is on file, after filing and prior to
effectiveness the Parent complies with its obligations to use best efforts to
cause the Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as
practicable after filing, and thereafter maintains its effectiveness for the
period specified in this Section 1.7(a) (subject to any Suspension or Blackout
Period), then Parent shall have no obligation to effect a Demand Registration.

 

(b) (i) Subject to Section 1.7(a), Seller may make a written
request for registration under the Securities Act of all or part of the
Registrable Securities (a "Demand Registration"), and Parent shall comply with
such request; provided, that Parent shall not be obligated to effect more than
one (1) Demand Registration in any twelve (12) month period; and provided,
further, that the number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by
Seller making such written request shall have a market value of at least Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000); provided that Seller shall not be entitled to
request or participate in a Demand Registration at any time after the date on
which such Seller could sell all Registrable Shares then held by such Seller
in one transaction without restriction by the volume limitations of Rule
144(e) under the Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, the number of
Demand Registrations which may be made pursuant to this Section 1.7(b)(i)
shall be unlimited. Any such request will specify the number of Registrable
Securities proposed to be sold and will also specify the intended method of
disposition thereof. Within ten (10) days after receipt of such request,
Parent will give written notice of such registration request to any other
Seller and include in such registration all such Registrable Securities with
respect to which Parent has received written requests for inclusion therein
within twenty (20) days after the receipt by such Seller of Parents notice.
Each such request will also specify the number of Registrable Securities to be
registered and the intended method of disposition thereof. Unless Seller
shall consent in writing, no other party, including Parent, shall be
permitted to offer securities under any registration statement required to be
filed pursuant to a Demand Registration.

 

(ii) A registration will not count as a Demand Registration until it
has become effective and shall have remained effective until the earlier of
(A) ninety (90) days after the effectiveness date or (B) all Registrable
Shares registered under such registration statement shall have been sold
pursuant to such registration statement; provided that if such request for
Demand Registration is withdrawn at the request of any Seller, such
registration shall count as a Demand Registration unless the participating
Sellers agree to pay all expenses incurred by Parent in connection with such
requested registration.

 

(iii) If Seller so elects by written notice to Parent, the offering of
such Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in
the form of an underwritten offering. Seller shall select the book-running
managing Underwriter in connection with such registration; provided that such
managing Underwriter must be reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Parent may
select any additional investment banks and managers to be used in

 



 

15

  connection with the offering; provided that such additional investment bankers
and managers must be reasonably satisfactory to Seller. To the extent 25% or
more of the Registrable Securities so requested to be registered are excluded
from the offering, Seller shall have the right to one (1) additional Demand
Registration under this Section 1.7(b) in such twelve-month period with
respect to such Registrable Securities; provided in no event shall Parent be
required to effect more than two Demand Registrations pursuant to this
provision in any 12 month period.

 

(iv) In order to effectuate such Demand Registration, Parent will as
expeditiously as practicable prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on any form for which Parent then qualifies or which counsel for
Parent shall deem appropriate and which form shall be available for the sale
of the Registrable Securities to be registered thereunder in accordance with
the intended method of distribution thereof, and use its best efforts to cause
such filed registration statement to become and remain effective for a period
of not less than 270 days.

 

(c) In connection with a registration statement required to be filed
hereunder, Parent will use its best efforts to (i) register or qualify the
Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States (where an exemption does not apply) as
Seller reasonably (in light of Sellers intended plan of distribution)
requests and (ii) cause such Registrable Securities to be registered with or
approved by such other Governmental Entities in the United States as may be
necessary by virtue of the business and operations of Parent and do any and
all other acts and things that may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
enable Seller to consummate the disposition in each such jurisdiction of the
Registrable Securities owned by Seller; provided, that Parent will not be
required to (A) qualify generally to do business or to register as a broker or
dealer in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify
but for this paragraph (c), (B) subject itself to taxation in any such
jurisdiction or (C) consent to general service of process in any such
jurisdiction.

 

(d) At the request of Seller, Parent shall promptly furnish to Seller
and each Underwriter, if any, without charge, as many copies of the
registration statement as proposed to be filed, and thereafter furnish to
Seller and Underwriter, if any, such number of conformed copies of such
registration statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case
including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein), the prospectus included in such registration statement (including
the preliminary prospectus) and such other documents as Seller or Underwriter
may reasonably request to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Shares
pursuant to such registration statement.

 

(e) Parent shall pay the following expenses incurred by Parent in
connection with the registration of the Registrable Shares: (i) all
registration and filing fees, (ii) fees and expenses of compliance with
securities or blue sky laws (including reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel to Parent in connection with blue sky qualifications of the
Registrable Securities), (iii) printing expenses, (iv) internal expenses
(including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and
employees of Parent performing legal or accounting duties), (v) the fees and
expenses incurred by Parent in connection with the listing of the Registrable
Securities, and (vi) reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for Parent
and customary fees and expenses for independent certified public accountants
retained by Parent (including the expenses of any comfort letters or costs
associated with the delivery by independent certified public accountants of a
comfort letter or comfort letters requested pursuant

 



 

16

   to subsection (g) below). Parent shall have no obligation to pay any
underwriters or brokers discounts or commissions or any fees or
disbursements of any counsel, advisors or experts retained by any Seller.

 

(f) With respect to any Demand Registration for an underwritten
offering, Parent will make available for inspection by Seller or Underwriter,
if any, participating in any disposition pursuant to a registration statement
required to be filed hereunder and any attorney, accountant or other
professional retained by Seller or any such Underwriter (collectively, the
"Inspectors"), all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents
and properties of Parent (collectively, the "Records") as shall be reasonably
necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and
cause Parents officers, directors and employees to supply all information
reasonably requested by any Inspectors in connection with such registration
statement. Records which Parent determines, in good faith, to be confidential
and which it notifies the Inspectors are confidential shall not be disclosed
by the Inspectors unless (i) the disclosure of such Records is necessary to
avoid or correct a misstatement or omission in such registration statement or
related preliminary prospectus or prospectus or (ii) the release of such
Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of
competent jurisdiction. Seller agrees that information obtained by it as a
result of such inspections shall be deemed confidential and shall not be used
by it as the basis for any market transactions in the securities of Parent
unless and until such is made generally available to the public. Seller
further agrees that it will, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is
sought in a court of competent jurisdiction, give notice to Parent and allow
Parent, at its expense, to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure
of the Records deemed confidential. 

 

(g) With respect to any Demand Registration for an underwritten
offering, Parent will enter into customary agreements (including an
underwriting agreement, if any, in customary form) and take such other actions
as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition
of such Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement,
including but not limited to, using its best efforts to furnish to Seller or
Underwriter, if any, a signed counterpart, addressed to Seller or Underwriter,
of (i) an opinion or opinions of counsel to Parent and (ii) if eligible under
applicable accounting standards, a comfort letter or comfort letters from
Parents independent public accountants, each in customary form and covering
such matters of the type customarily covered by opinions or comfort letters,
as the case may be, as Seller or Underwriter reasonably requests.

 

(h) Subject to Section 1.7(i), in the event of: (i) any request by
the SEC or any other federal or state Governmental Entity during the period of
effectiveness of a registration statement contemplated by this Section 1.7 for
amendments or supplements to such registration statement or related
preliminary prospectus or prospectus or for additional information; (ii) the
issuance by the SEC or any other federal or state Governmental Entity of any
stop order suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement
contemplated by this Section 1.7 or the initiation of any proceedings for that
purpose; (iii) the receipt by Parent of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the
Registrable Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any
Action for such purpose; or (iv) any event or circumstance that, in the good
faith judgment of, Parent necessitates the making of any changes in a
registration statement contemplated by this Section 1.7 or related preliminary
prospectus or prospectus, or any document incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated therein by

 



 

17

  reference, so that, in the case of such registration statement, it will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and that in the case of a preliminary prospectus or
prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading; then Parent shall deliver a document in
writing to Seller (the "Suspension Notice") to the effect of the foregoing
(which notice will include the date of the beginning and end of the intended
suspension, if known) and, upon receipt of each Suspension Notice, Seller will
suspend offers and sales of Registrable Shares pursuant to such
registration statement (the "Suspension") until Seller receives copies of a
supplemented or amended preliminary prospectus or prospectus prepared and
filed by Parent, or until Seller is advised in writing by Parent that the
current preliminary prospectus or prospectus may be used, and has received
copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or
deemed incorporated by reference in any such preliminary prospectus or
prospectus. In the event of any Suspension, Parent will use best efforts to
cause the use of the preliminary prospectus or prospectus so suspended to be
resumed as soon as reasonably practicable after delivery of a Suspension
Notice to Seller; provided, however, that in any 12 month period, the
aggregate duration of any Suspension may not exceed 90 days. Nothing in this
Section 1.7(h) shall prevent Seller from offering, selling or distributing
pursuant to Rule 144 at any time to the extent permitted under applicable Law.

 

(i) If at any time Parent sends a Suspension Notice to the Seller,
Parent also notifies the Seller that the event giving rise to such notice
relates to a development involving Parent and that Parent has determined that
disclosure of such development at such time would be detrimental to Parent and
its Subsidiaries, then Parent will not be required to use best **** efforts to
make any changes to any registration statement contemplated by this Section
1.7 or related preliminary prospectus or prospectus, or any document
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, during a
period of up to 45 consecutive days as specified in the notice contemplated
herein (the "Blackout Period"), and Seller shall suspend offers and sales
of Registrable Shares pursuant to such registration statement during each
Blackout Period; provided, however, that in any period of 365 consecutive days
Parent may not avail itself of its rights under this Section 1.7(i) with
respect to more than two Blackout Periods. Nothing in this Section 1.7(i)
shall prevent Seller from offering, selling or distributing pursuant to Rule
144 at any time to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Section 1.7, no
Suspension nor Blackout Period may be declared unless declared for all holders
of Parent Common Stock that have registration rights and may not have a
duration longer than the shortest such period applicable to any such holder.

 

(k) Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent
permitted by Law, each Seller and each Sellers partner, advisors, affiliates,
trustee, representatives, employees and agents against all Losses resulting
from any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact in,
or any omission (or alleged omission) of a material fact required to be stated
in, any registration statement contemplated by this Section 1.7 or related
preliminary prospectus or prospectus, or necessary to make the statements
therein (in the case of a preliminary prospectus or prospectus, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made)

 



 

18

  not misleading or any violation by Parent of the Securities Act, state
securities Laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under such Laws
applicable to Parent in connection with any such registration, as such
expenses are incurred, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained
in any information furnished in writing to Parent by such Seller expressly for
use therein and except to the extent such indemnification obligation arises
out of or is based upon sales of Registrable Shares by the Seller (i) after
the delivery by Parent to Seller of a Suspension Notice and before (A) the
delivery by Parent of the supplemented or amended preliminary prospectus or
prospectus prepared and filed by Parent as provided in Section 1.7(h) or (B)
Seller is advised in writing by Parent that the current preliminary prospectus
or prospectus may be used, or (ii) during a Blackout Period specified in
Section 1.7(i). The indemnity provided for in this Section 1.7(k) shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of Seller.

 

(l) In connection with any registration statement contemplated by
this Section 1.7, each Seller will furnish to Parent in writing such
information as Parent reasonably requests for use in connection with such
registration statement or related preliminary prospectus or prospectus and
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by Law,
Parent, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, advisors and agents,
and each Person who controls Parent against all Losses resulting from any
untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact in, or any
omission (or alleged omission) of a material fact required to be stated in,
such registration statement or related preliminary prospectus or prospectus or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a preliminary
prospectus or prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading or any violation by any Seller of the Securities Act,
state securities Laws or any rule or regulation promulgated under such Laws
applicable to Seller in connection with any such registration, or from sales
of Registrable Shares by Seller (i) after the delivery by Parent to Seller of
a Suspension Notice and before (A) the delivery by Parent of the supplemented
or amended prospectus prepared and filed by Parent as provided in Section
1.7(h) or (B) Seller is advised in writing by Parent that the current
preliminary prospectus or prospectus may be used or (ii) during a Blackout
Period specified in Section 1.7(i), as such expenses are incurred, provided
that in the event of such an untrue statement or omission the Seller shall be
liable only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained
in any information so furnished in writing by Seller to Parent specifically
for inclusion therein. In no event shall any Seller be liable pursuant to this
paragraph for any amount in excess of the gross proceeds received by such
Seller from the Registrable Shares sold by such Seller pursuant to such
registration statement.

 

(m) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
written notice of the commencement of any Action with respect to which a claim
for indemnification may be made pursuant to this Section 1.7, such indemnified
party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an
indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of
such Action; provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to
give notice as provided herein will not relieve the indemnifying party of any
obligations hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party has
been materially prejudiced by such failure. If any such Action is brought
against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to
participate in and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified, to the extent that it may wish, with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after such
notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party

 



 

19

  of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall
not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof,
unless the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense of such claim
and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified person. An
indemnifying party who elects not to assume the defense of a claim will not be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel in any single
jurisdiction for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with
respect to such claim, or with respect to claims separate but similar or
related in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations.
No indemnifying party may consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to a claim without the consent of the indemnified
party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, or unless such
judgment or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect of such claim. No indemnified party may consent to entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any action the defense of
which has been assumed by an indemnifying party, and no indemnified party may
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any action
the defense of which has not been assumed by an indemnifying party without the
consent of such indemnifying party, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld.

 

(n) If for any reason the indemnification provided for in subsections
(k) and (l) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient to hold it
harmless, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or
liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault
of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement or the omission or alleged omission relates to information supplied
by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand or the indemnified party
on the other and the parties relevant intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or
omission. No party guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (with the meaning of
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any party
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentations. In no event shall
any Seller be required to contribute pursuant to this paragraph any amount in
excess of the gross proceeds received by such Seller from the Registrable
Shares sold by such Seller pursuant to such registration statement.

 

(o) Parent shall use best efforts to ensure that prior to the
effectiveness of a registration statement contemplated by this Section 1.7,
the Registrable Shares have been accepted for quotation on the Nasdaq Global
Market, subject to notice of issuance.

 

(p) (i) Seller will cooperate reasonably in providing to Parent such
information as is customarily and reasonably required of selling stockholders
in a registered offering.

 

(ii) The parties acknowledge that Parent may be required to include
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in any registration statement that Parent may file with the SEC pursuant to
the Securities Act, including any registration statement contemplated by this
Section 1.7, and in current and periodic reports that

 



 

20

  Parent will file with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, including a
Current Report on Form 8-K reporting on the closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby. To the extent Parent, either in connection with the
registration obligations in this Section 1.7 or to otherwise comply with any
SEC or other reporting obligation before the Closing, requires that (a) any
audits be performed on the financial statements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (b) any other changes be made to such financial statements in
order to comply with any SEC requirements, or (c) any certifications or
consents be provided (collectively, "Financial Statement Matters"), then (A)
Parent shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses related to or
arising out of all Financial Statement Matters and the engagement of all
auditors performing any related services, (B) Parent shall be solely
responsible (subject to the next clause) for procuring, obtaining and causing
the completion of all Financial Statement Matters, (C) Seller will, until the
Closing Date, reasonably cooperate in Parents efforts to procure, obtain or
complete all Financial Statement Matters, at Parents sole expense (except as
set forth in the penultimate sentence of this subsection), which cooperation
will include without limitation (1) providing the access described in Section
4.1, (2) executing any documentation reasonably required by the Parent or
Parents independent public accountants in connection with such accountants
audit, including standard representation letters, (3) providing copies of
internal financial statements and any related work papers and supporting
documentation and (4) requesting the Companys auditors to reasonably
cooperate with Parents independent public accountants and (D) any failure by
Seller to comply with its obligations under this sentence will, as its sole
consequence, defer Parents filing obligations in respect of the registration
obligations under Section 1.7(a) by the number of days that such filing is
delayed by Sellers failure to comply with the provisions of subsection (C)
above (as measured from the date that written notice is delivered by Parent to
Seller that Parent believes in good faith that Seller is in violation of
subsection (C), and that such violation is preventing Parent from proceeding
with the registration obligation under 1.7(a), and until such time that such
violation has ceased or been cured), and shall not give constitute or
contribute to any breach or default by Seller or a failure of any condition to
Closing in favor of Parent. The parties agree that they will retain KPMG, LLP
to conduct the audit of the 2006 financial statements of the Company and its

_Purchase of Foreign Subsidiaries_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

Buyer and Parent may elect to have one or more of their foreign Affiliates
purchase the Equity Securities of one or more foreign Subsidiaries of the
Company (in particular, the parties anticipate that the foreign Affiliates of
Parent may purchase the Equity Securities of the foreign Subsidiaries of the
Company in Spain, Germany and Australia), with the timing of the transaction
or transactions to occur on the Closing Date either simultaneous with or
immediately prior to the Closing. If Buyer and Parent make such an election,
they will provide notice to the Seller at least ten days prior to the Closing,
which notice must specify in reasonable detail the structure of the
transaction or transactions and be accompanied by Contracts and other
documents needed to effect such transaction or transactions. The parties will
work in good faith to negotiate and enter into such additional Contracts
and other documents as may be necessary to effect such purchases. If any such
purchase occurs, the aggregate purchase price payable to the owner of the
Companys foreign Subsidiary will reduce the Cash Purchase Price hereunder by
an equal amount. If, as a result of any such purchase, Seller, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries would have to (i) incur any additional expenses (not
including any expenses addressed elsewhere in this Agreement ( _e.g._ ,
Sections 2.20 and 5.5 (other, with respect to Section 5.5, than the fees of

 



 

22

  legal and tax professionals that are directly attributable to the purchase of
the foreign Subsidiaries as described herein) or (ii) pay any additional Taxes
to a Governmental Entity (such additional expenses and Taxes, the "
_Additional Costs_ "), the Cash Purchase Price will be increased (such
increase, the " _Foreign Subsidiary Purchase Price Increase_ ") by an amount
equal to such Additional Costs.

good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, except

interest therein, any other interest of Seller or any other Person therein,
the jurisdiction in which Company and each Subsidiary was organized, and each

Effect. Company and its Subsidiaries have all necessary corporate power and
authority to own their respective properties and assets and to carry on their
respective businesses as now conducted and are duly qualified or licensed to

which the character or the location of the assets owned or leased by any of
them or the nature of the business conducted by any of them requires licensing
or qualification, except where failure (i) to be so in good standing or
qualified or licensed or (ii) to have such power and authority would not have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. _Schedule 2.1_ correctly lists the current
directors and executive officers of Company and of each Subsidiary. True,
correct and complete copies of the respective charter documents of Company
and its Subsidiaries as currently in effect have been delivered to Buyer.

Contracts or other rights to subscribe for or purchase, or Contracts or other
obligations to issue or grant any rights to acquire, any Equity Securities of
Company or any Subsidiary. There are no outstanding Contracts, nor any other
shares, equity interests, options, warrants, calls, commitments, conversion
rights, rights of exchange, plans or other arrangements of any character of
Seller, Company or any Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any Equity Securities of any of such entities. There are no preemptive rights

be terminated for any reason, (ii) any financing source that is a party to the
Financing Commitment notifies Buyer or Parent that such source no longer
intends to provide financing to Buyer or Parent on the terms set forth
therein, or (iii) for any reason Buyer or Parent no longer believe in good
faith that it will be able to obtain any of the financing substantially on the
terms described in the Financing Commitment. Buyer and Parent shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, without the prior
written consent of Seller, take any action or enter into any transaction,
including, without limitation, any merger, acquisition, joint venture,
disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing that could reasonably

45

  issued, funding conditions no less favorable than those included in the

the termination date included in the Financing Commitment as originally
issued, and other terms and conditions the aggregate effect of which is not

transactions contemplated hereby in comparison with those terms and conditions
contained in the Financing Commitment as originally issued. Buyer and Parent
shall accept any such new commitment letter if the funding conditions and
other terms and conditions contained therein, in the aggregate, are not
materially adverse to Buyer and Parent in comparison with those contained in
the Financing Commitment as originally issued.

 

(c) Buyer and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
Seller to be named as a third party beneficiary of all Financing Commitments.

in connection with the Financing. Any such certificate, opinion, appraisal or
other statement will be provided to Seller at the time it is provided to any
banks or other lenders or promptly thereafter.

 

(e) It is expressly understood and agreed that Parents and Buyers
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on

condition or contingent upon the results of Parents and Buyers efforts to
obtain the full amount of the Financing required to effect the Closing
pursuant to, and to satisfy its obligations under, Article II hereof,
including paying Seller the Cash Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.3
hereof.

publicly traded company and (ii) if divisions or subsidiaries of a business
enterprise are engaged in the Business, but other divisions or subsidiaries of
such business enterprise are not engaged in the Business, it shall not be a
violation of this Section 5.1(a) to take otherwise prohibited actions with
respect to such other divisions or subsidiaries provided that the Seller is

subsidiaries that are engaged in the Business. For purposes of this Section
5.1(a), " _Permitted Businesses_ " means those businesses described on

provided to Buyers similarly situated employees or (ii) those benefits that
the Affected Employees were receiving as of the date of this Agreement

reasonable or required under the Laws of the applicable jurisdiction. Any
discretionary elements of compensation, including any discretionary equity or
equity based awards, will remain discretionary.

 

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause Company and its Subsidiaries to,
honor all vacation, holiday, sickness and personal days accrued by Affected
Employees which are reflected on the Final Working Capital Statement.

 



 

47

  (d) Buyer shall, or shall cause Company and its Subsidiaries to, give
all Affected Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting
under any employee benefit plan arrangement maintained after the Closing Date
by Buyer or by Company or any Subsidiary thereof for such Affected Employees
service with Company or any Subsidiary; provided that such crediting of
service shall not result in any duplication of benefits nor shall such
crediting apply to any Benefit Plans implemented after the Closing Date.

 

(e) To the extent required by Law and if permitted by the applicable
insurance policies, Buyer shall, or shall cause Company and its Subsidiaries,
(i) with respect to any life, health or disability insurance plan, to waive

with respect to participation and coverage requirements under any welfare
benefit plan established to replace any Company Benefit Plan in which such

respect to such Affected Employee and that have not been satisfied as of the
Closing Date under any Company Benefit Plan maintained for the Affected
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) with respect to any
health insurance plan, to provide each Affected Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any

of seven (7) years after the Closing in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of individuals who prior to the Closing were directors,
officers, employees or agents of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, unless
such modification is required by Law, and in such event, Buyer and Parent
hereby agree to provide any rights to the extent they are so modified by Law
in a manner adverse to the beneficiaries. Any contract for indemnification of
directors, officers, employees or agents shall remain in effect, and the
Buyer and Parent shall cause Company and its Subsidiaries to continue to honor

their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other

Outside Date or the Extended Outside Date;

 

(iii) _Material Breach by Seller_. By Parent and Buyer, if Seller
breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform

susceptible to cure, Seller shall have thirty (30) business days after receipt
of reasonably specific notice from Parent and Buyer of a description of the

Buyer breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties or

Buyer shall have thirty (30) business days after receipt of reasonably

[Confidentiality] shall survive any such termination. A termination under
Section 7.1 shall not relieve any party of any liability for a breach of, or
for any misrepresentation under this Agreement, or be deemed to constitute a
waiver of any available remedy (including specific performance if available)
for any such breach or misrepresentation. The non-solicitation and all other
obligations contained in the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full

---|---|--- 
 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim may be made or suit or other Action
instituted under Sections 8.1(a), 8.1(b), 8.1(c), 8.2(a) and 8.2(b) following
the expiration of the applicable

 



 

55

  survival period set forth in Section 7.3 (the " _General Survival Period_ ")
except for Reserved Claims. The term " _Reserved Claims_ " shall mean: (a) all
claims as to which any Indemnified Party has in good faith given any
Indemnifying Party written notice on or prior to the end of the applicable
General Survival Period; and (b) all claims to the extent alleging fraud
(defined to require at a minimum intent to deceive). No claim may be made or
suit or other Action instituted under any provision of this Article 8 unless
the Indemnified Party provides written notice to the Indemnifying Party prior
to the expiration of the applicable period provided in Section 7.3 (which
written notice shall describe the facts then known by the Indemnified Party
relating to such claim, including, without limitation, the reason why the
Indemnified Party believes the claim is subject to indemnification by the
Indemnifying Party, and which for third-party claims, shall attach, if
available, a copy of the written instrument or instruments in which the third
party claim is asserted).

   

      



  |  

8.4

  |  

_Monetary Limitations on Indemnification_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

Seller shall not have any liability for indemnification to Buyer under
Sections 8.1(a) or 8.1(d) until such time as the aggregate amount of Losses

of such excess; _provided_ , _however_ , that no individual Loss of One
Hundred Thousand Dollars $100,000 or less shall be counted in determining
whether the Basket Amount has been reached. In addition, in no event shall
Seller have an aggregate liability in excess of $35,000,000 (i) as a result of
liability for indemnification under Section 8.1(a) (other than as a result of
liability for indemnification relating to or arising out of Section 2.2 as to
which this sentence is inapplicable), (ii) as a result of liability
for indemnification under Section 8.1(b) (other than as a result of liability
relating to or arising out of an intentional or willful disregard of a
covenant, as to which this sentence is inapplicable), or (iii) as a result of
liability for indemnification under Section 8.1(d), except to the extent of
fraud (defined to include, at a minimum, intent to deceive), in which case,
(except as to fraud as defined above), the aggregate liability shall not
exceed the Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence is
inapplicable to any other provision of this Agreement providing for
indemnification ( _e.g._ , Sections 1.7 and 8.7) even though such
indemnification might otherwise be construed as a covenant under Sections
8.1(b) or 8.1(c).

   

      



  |  

8.5

  |  

_Third Party Claims_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

Promptly after the receipt by any Indemnified Party of notice of the
commencement of any Action against such Indemnified Party by a third party
(other than any Action relating to Taxes governed by Section 8.7), such
Indemnified Party shall, if a claim with respect thereto is or may be made
against any Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article 8, give such
Indemnifying Party written notice thereof. The failure to give such notice
shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder except
where, and then solely to the extent that, such failure actually prejudices
the rights of such Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying Party shall have the
absolute right after the receipt of notice to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with such Action, at such Indemnifying Partys
expense and with counsel of its choice, provided that the Indemnifying
Party so notifies the Indemnified Party that it will defend such Action
within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice and commences the
defense of such Action; _provided_ , _however_ , Indemnified Party may
participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its sole
cost and expense and the Indemnifying Party shall not settle

 



 

56

  any such Action unless Indemnified Party is fully released without any
admission of liability, and the Indemnified Party is not otherwise obligated
to undertake any action, or restricted in taking any action by the terms of
such settlement. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume the
defense of such Action in accordance with the terms of this Section 8.5, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend such Action with counsel of
its choice reasonably acceptable to Seller and the Indemnifying Party will
reimburse the Indemnified Party for the costs thereof, including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses incurred. The Indemnifying Party will not be
liable for any judgment or settlement with respect to such Action effected
without its prior written consent. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully
with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of
any such indemnity claim.

8.6

  |  

_Nature of Indemnification Payments_.

  |  

8.7

  |  

_Certain Tax Matters_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

(a) _ _Seller Indemnity__. Seller agrees, jointly and severally to
defend and hold harmless Buyer against (i) any Tax due and payable by or on
behalf of Company or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date that
is attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, including the Divestiture Taxes,
if any (collectively, all of such Taxes are referred to herein as the "
_Aggregate Pre-Closing Taxes_ "), and (ii) any deficiencies in any Tax payable
by or on behalf of Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from any audit
by any taxing agency or authority with respect to any of the Aggregate Pre-
Closing Taxes, including the Divestiture Taxes, if any, _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be liable
for any Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods that have been paid by
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date nor shall Seller be
liable for any Aggregate Pre-Closing Taxes attributable to Tax periods ending
on or before the Interim Balance Sheet Date unless the aggregate amount of all
such Taxes attributable to Tax periods ending on or before the Interim Balance
Sheet Date (and not paid by Company or its Subsidiaries on or prior to the
Closing Date) exceeds the amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes on the face
of the Company Interim Balance Sheet and is included in the Final Working
Capital Statement. The term " _Pre Closing Tax Period_ " shall mean all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion of a
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

 

(b) _ _Buyer Indemnity__. Buyer shall be liable for and shall pay
(and shall indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, successors and assigns harmless from and against) all Taxes of or
attributable to Company or its Subsidiaries that are attributable to any Post-
Closing Tax Period. The term " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ " shall mean all
taxable periods that begin after the Closing Date and the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date.

 

(c) _ _Straddle Period__. In the event the Companys status as an S
corporation is not terminated as a result of the Closing, Seller and Buyer
agree to terminate the Companys tax year in accordance with Code Section
1377. For purposes of Section 8.7(a) and Section 8.7(b), in

 



 

57

  the case of any Taxes that are payable for a Tax period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such
Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (i) in the case of any
Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, sales, gross receipts,
wages, capital expenditures or expenses, be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax
based upon or related to income, sales, gross receipts, wages, capital
expenditures or expenses, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable
if the Pre-Closing Tax Period ended on the Closing Date.

 

(d) _ _Transfer Taxes__. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne equally by
Seller and Buyer.

 

(e) _ _Cooperation in Tax Matters__. Each party to this Agreement (a
" _Party_ ," or collectively the " _Parties_ ") shall provide the other
Parties with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by such Party in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other
examination by any taxing authority, or any judicial or administrative
proceedings relating to Liability for Taxes, and shall retain and provide the
other Parties with any records or information which may be relevant to such
Tax Return, audit, examination, proceedings or determination (but only to the
extent he, she or it had possession of such records or other
information immediately after the Closing). Such assistance shall include
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder and
shall include providing copies of any relevant Tax Return and supporting work
schedules. The Party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the other
Parties for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such
assistance. Without limiting the provision of this Section 8.7(e) Buyer agrees
that it shall retain, until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date,
copies of all Tax Returns, work schedules and other records or information
which Buyer, Company or any of its Subsidiaries possess and which may be
relevant to such Tax Returns of Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods.

 

(f) _ _Overpayment__. Any overpayment of Taxes by Company and/or
Seller on behalf of Company, plus any interest thereon, resulting from an
audit or examination of any Pre-Closing Tax Return (" _Tax Refunds_ ") shall
be remitted by Buyer to Seller within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such
overpayment by Buyer or Company, or if such excess is applied to other Taxes
owed by Buyer or Company for which Seller is not responsible, within fifteen
(15) days of filing of the relevant Tax Return applying such overpayment.

   

      



  |  

8.8

  |  

_Insurance Proceeds_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no indemnification
shall be made by Seller with respect to any matter to the extent that
insurance proceeds have been collected by Buyer with respect to that matter.
Buyer and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover under
insurance policies for any Losses prior to seeking indemnification under this
Agreement.

 



 

58

        



  |  

8.9

  |  

_Tax Benefits_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in determining the
amount of any claims of an Indemnified Party (" _Claims_ "), such amount shall
be reduced by the amount of any tax benefit effects (" _Tax Benefits Effects_
") accruing to the Indemnified Party related to the Claims or the payments
made pursuant to such Claims. The Tax Benefits Effects shall be determined by
taking into account all facts and circumstances existing at the date of the
Closing through the future date(s) to which such benefits run (to the extent
of the present value thereof, discounted at the applicable federal rate, as of
the date of such indemnification). For purposes of determining the time or
times at which Tax Benefits Effects shall be taken into account to reduce any
indemnification claims hereunder, the parties agree that Tax Benefits Effects
shall reduce the amount of any indemnification claims only if, as and when
actually realized by the Indemnified Party. If an Indemnifying Party has paid
for an indemnification claim which is later subject to reduction due to a Tax
Benefits Effect, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay such amount to the
Indemnifying Party.

 

      



  |  

8.10

  |  

_Subrogation_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

Upon making any indemnity payment pursuant to this Article 8, the Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any
third party in respect of the Losses to which the payment related. The parties
hereto will execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence and perfect the above described subrogation rights.

 

      



  |  

8.11

  |  

_Specific Performance_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

Each partys obligation under this Agreement is unique. If any party should
breach its covenants under this Agreement, the parties each acknowledge that
it would be extremely impracticable to measure the resulting damages;
accordingly, the nonbreaching party or parties, in addition to any other
available rights or remedies they may have under the terms of this Agreement,
may sue in equity for specific performance, and each party expressly waives
the defense that a remedy in damages will be adequate.

 

      



  |  

8.12

  |  

_Exclusive Remedy_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any breach or
failure to be true and correct, or alleged breach or failure to be true and
correct, of any representation or warranty, or any breach or alleged breach or
non-performance of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement and any related
agreements or documents, shall be indemnification in accordance with Section
1.7 or this Article 8. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties
hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all
other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of contributions,
if any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in
the future, that it may have against Seller or Buyer and Parent, as the case
may be, arising under or based upon any federal, state or local Law (including
any such Law relating to banking or regulatory matters or arising under or
based upon any securities Law, common Law or otherwise). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 8.12 shall not operate to (i) interfere with or impede
the operation of the provisions of Article 1 providing for the resolution of
certain disputes relating to the Purchase Price between the parties

 



 

59

  and/or by an independent accountant or (ii) limit the rights of the parties to
seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief)
or to redress fraud (defined to require, at a minimum, intent to deceive).

disclosure is reasonably apparent to a reader from the text or context of such
information.

document shall be construed as an admission or indication to any party other
than to Buyer or Parent that such agreement or document is enforceable or
currently in effect under such agreement or document. No disclosure in Seller
Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any
Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such

(b) Each party hereby irrevocably submits to and accepts for itself
and its properties, generally and unconditionally, the exclusive jurisdiction

Court located in the State of California, Central District, and service of
process pursuant to the laws of such courts, waives any defense of forum non
conveniens and agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered thereby arising
under or out of in respect of or in connection with this Agreement or any
related document or obligation. Each party further irrevocably designates and
appoints the attorney designated as the copyholder in or pursuant to Section
9.15 hereof to receive notices on its behalf, as its agent to receive on its
behalf service of all process in any such Action before any body, such
service being hereby acknowledged to be effective and binding service in every
respect. A copy of any such process so served shall be mailed by registered
mail to each party by mailing the designated attorney at its address provided
in Section 9.15, with a copy to the party listed as the primary notice
recipient; provided that, unless otherwise provided by applicable law, any
failure to mail such copy shall not affect the validity of the service of such
process. If any agent so appointed refuses to accept service, the designating
party hereby agrees that service of process sufficient for personal
jurisdiction in any action against it in the applicable jurisdiction may be
made by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to its address
of the attorney designated as the copyholder as provided in Section 9.15. Each
party hereby acknowledges that such service shall be effective and binding in
every respect. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right of any party to bring
any action or proceeding against the other party in any other jurisdiction.

Seller, Buyer and Parent each acknowledge that each party to this Agreement
has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the

this Agreement against the party that drafted it has no application and is
expressly waived.

 

      



  |  

9.22

  |  

_Severability_.

 _EXHIBIT A_

 



 

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

 

THIS TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT, dated as of ____________, 2007 (this " _
**Agreement**_ "), by and among RIA Envia, Inc., a New York corporation ("
_RIA_ "), and Associated Foreign Exchange, Inc. a California corporation (the
" _ **New Afex**_ ").

 

WHEREAS, Euronet Payments and Remittance, Inc., a North Carolina corporation
(the " _ **Buyer**_ "), the sole stockholder of Buyer, and the holders of all
of the outstanding capital stock of RIA are parties to a Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as of November 21, 2006 (the " _ **Purchase Agreement**_ "),
pursuant to which the Buyer will purchase, amongst other things, all of the
capital stock of RIA;

 

WHEREAS, the entering into of this Agreement is a condition to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
warranties, covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

      



  |  

Section 1

  |  

_Definitions._ 

---|---|--- 
 

 

In this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings.

 

" _ **Service Provider**_ " means, with respect to each of the Services, the
party designated as the "Service Provider" as set forth in Schedule I attached
hereto. The term "Service Provider" is deemed to include any affiliate of the
Service Provider that is directed by Service Provider to provide Services
and/or receive compensation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 

" _ **Service Receiver**_ " means, with respect to each of the Services, the
party designated as the "Service Receiver" as set forth in Schedule I attached
hereto. The term "Service Receiver" is deemed to include any affiliate of the
Service Receiver that is directed by Service Receiver to receive Services
and/or pay compensation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 

" _ **Services**_ " means any of the services as set forth in Schedule I
attached hereto to be provided by the Service Provider to the Service Receiver
set forth in Schedule I attached hereto.

 

" _ **Term**_ " or _**"Terms"**_ means, with respect to each of the Services,
the period of time beginning on the date hereof and expiring on the date set
forth in Schedule I attached hereto.

 

All terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such
terms in the Purchase Agreement.

        



  |  

Section 2

  |  

_Services._ 

---|---|--- 
 

 

(a) Commencing on the date hereof and continuing throughout the
respective Terms, the Service Provider shall provide (or cause to be provided)
to the Service Receiver the Services as set forth in Schedule I attached
hereto. The Services shall be substantially equivalent in nature, scope,
quality and volume as provided by the Service Provider prior to the Closing
Date. The Service Provider shall provide (or cause to be provided) the
Services to the Service Receiver in a manner that is not adversely
discriminatory as compared to any similar Services provided by Service
Provider to its own business.

 

(b) The Service Receiver understands that the Services provided
hereunder are transitional in nature and are furnished by the Service Provider
for the purpose of accommodating the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement. The Service Receiver agrees to transition to its own internal
organization or other third party service providers for the provision of each
of the Services as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later
than the expiration of the applicable Term. In no event shall the Service
Receivers failure to transition off of a Service prior to expiration of the
applicable Term be considered a breach hereof, and the Service Receivers
failure to so transition shall not obligate the Service Provider to continue
providing Services after the expiration of the applicable Term.

 

(c) The Service Receiver understands that, with respect to the
Services related to information technology and software support described on
Schedule I, certain systems are used by the Service Provider on its corporate
computers under license agreements between the Service Provider and various
vendors. In order for the Service Provider to provide the Services using such
systems to the Service Receiver, the Service Provider may be required to
negotiate new license agreements, or amendments to the existing agreements,
with the vendors of these systems. Any reasonable incremental out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Service Provider in connection with its
efforts to obtain all necessary rights to provide the Services to the Service
Receiver using such systems shall be promptly reimbursed by the Service
Receiver, provided that such costs and expenses are approved in advance by the
Service Receiver and provided that such reimbursement does not result in a
duplication of costs already allocated in the costs set forth in the Schedule
I attached hereto. For the avoidance of doubt, the Service Provider shall not
be obligated to provide any services for which Service Receiver refuses to
approve such costs in advance.

 

(d) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, the Services are
provided "AS IS." SERVICE PROVIDER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED AND STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-
INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN
INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY SERVICE PROVIDER (INCLUDING ITS AGENTS OR
EMPLOYEES) SHALL IN ANY WAY CREATE ANY WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

 



 

A-2

  (e) Solely with respect to the Services related to information
technology described on Schedule I, at the sole cost of the Service Receiver,
during the term of Service set forth on Schedule I, the Service Provider shall
cooperate with the Service Receiver and its representatives in the transition
from operating or using the Service Providers systems, hardware and

_Payment_ 

---|---|--- 
 

 

(a) In consideration for the provision of Services by the Service
Provider, the Service Receiver agrees to pay to the Service Provider those
amounts determined in accordance with the rates and charges set forth in
Schedule I attached hereto. In addition, the Service Receiver shall pay the
Service Provider all incidental out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably
incurred by the Service Provider in providing the Services including, but not
limited to, air fare, lodging, meals, mileage, parking and ground
transportation. Notwithstanding the above, the Service Provider shall have the
option to increase the charges for the Services provided to the Service
Receiver upon 30 days prior written notice at any time it increases the
charges to its own business units for the same Services; provided, however,
that any increases in charges for such Services shall be limited to the
average increases in rates charged for the same Services to the Service
Providers own business units; and provided, further, that any such increase
shall be subject to the Service Receivers right of termination of Services as
provided in Section 4.

 

(b) Within 21 days of the last day of each calendar month, the
Service Provider shall provide to the Service Receiver an invoice for the
preceding months Services, which shall include (i) the Services provided by
the Service Provider to the Service Receiver for such month, (ii) the charges
for such Services, (iii) a list of the incidental out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Service Provider for such month, and (iv) reasonable
documentation verifying the incidental out-of-pocket expenses and third-party
service charges billed, including copies of third-party statements and
invoices. The amount stated in such invoices shall be paid by the Service
Receiver in full within 10 days of the invoices being issued to an account
designated by the Service Provider, provided that if the Service Receiver
disputes in good faith any invoiced amount, the Service Receiver shall not be
obligated to pay the disputed amount within such time frame.

 

(c) All payments due to the Service Provider under this Agreement
shall be exclusive of any sales tax or other applicable tax or levy, which
shall be payable by the Service Receiver.

 

(d) In no event shall any Service Provider withhold or delay
providing Services on account of any breach, or alleged breach, of the
Purchase Agreement, or any other agreement entered into in connection
therewith. However, any Service Receiver may set-off against amounts due under
this Agreement relating to the provision of Services; provided, however that
no Service Receiver shall have any other set-off rights, including, without
limitation, any rights to withhold, set-off or defer payment of any amount
required under the Purchase Agreement or any agreement referred to therein

 



 

A-3

  (other than this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, any breach hereunder
shall not constitute a breach of, or be indemnifiable pursuant to, the
Purchase Agreement.

 

(e) In the event of any material Service interruption, whether or not
scheduled, or any other disputed invoiced amount, RIA and New Afex agree to
negotiate in good faith to adjust the relevant charges for the applicable
Services or other costs if and to the extent appropriate.

_Early Termination of Particular Services._ 

---|---|--- 
 

 

If the Service Receiver should, at any time during the respective Terms, cease
to require the Service Provider to provide any particular Service (the " _
**Designated Services**_ "), it shall give at least 15 days prior written
notice to such effect to the Service Provider. Following the receipt of such
notice the Service Provider shall, within the time period designated therein
(not to be less than 15 days), cease to provide the Designated Services.
Cancellation shall not relieve the Service Receiver from paying for any
Services rendered by the Service Provider prior to cancellation. This
Agreement is a master agreement and shall be construed as a separate and
independent agreement for each Service to be provided hereunder. Any
termination of this Agreement with respect to any Service or Designated
Services shall not terminate this Agreement with respect to any other Service
then being provided pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 5

  |  

_Sub-Contracting._ 

---|---|--- 
 

 

The Service Provider may, upon at least 15 days prior written notice and the
prior written consent of the Service Receiver, not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, delegate or sub-contract its duties under this Agreement to a
qualified third party, provided that, notwithstanding such delegation or sub-
contracting, the Service Provider shall still remain liable for the
performance of its duties hereunder.

writing by the parties, the Service Providers obligation to provide or
procure, and the Service Receivers obligation to purchase, a Service shall
cease as of the end of the applicable Term (and any permitted extension) as
set forth in Schedule I attached hereto or upon such earlier termination as
provided in Section 4.

 

(b) Either party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to
the other party if the other party commits a material breach of any of the
terms or conditions of this Agreement and, if such breach is capable of cure,
fails to remedy the breach within 30 days of reasonable specific written
notice of breach being given to the other party.

 

(c) Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Service
Receiver shall pay to the Service Provider all monies due to the Service
Provider in respect of Services provided prior to such termination or
expiration.

THE CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS EVIDENCED BY THIS CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS
AGREEMENT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED, OR UNDER ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A
WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL, REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, TO THE
EFFECT THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER APPLICABLE FEDERAL
AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS

 

CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS AGREEMENT

 

THIS CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of
the ___ day of ___________, 2007 (the " _Grant Date_ ") by and between Euronet
Worldwide, Inc. (the "Company") and ______________________________ (the "
_Holder_ "). (The Company and Holder are sometimes individually referred to as
a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties").

 

WHEREAS, the Company and the Holder are parties to that certain Stock Purchase
Agreement dated November 21, 2006 (" _Stock Purchase Agreement_ "), pursuant
to which the Company agreed that it would grant to Holder certain contingent
value rights to receive payments in cash or in shares of the Companys common
stock, par value $0.02 per share (such rights are sometimes referred to herein
individually as a " _CVR_ " and collectively as " _CVRs_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to enter into this Agreement to set forth the
terms and conditions of the CVRs.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein and
in the Stock Purchase Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 

1. _Grant of CVRs_. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to Holder, as of the Grant Date, contingent value rights associated with _________________ (______) shares of Common Stock (the " _Aggregate Base Common Stock_ ") [$100 million of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to Section 1.3 of the Stock Purchase Agreement as designated by the Company] issued to the Holder under the Stock Purchase Agreement in the amount of One (1) CVR for each share of Aggregate Base Common Stock. 

 

      



  |  

2.

  |  

_Settlement of CVRs_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

      



  |  

(a)

  |  

For purposes of this Agreement: 

---|---|--- 
 

 

(i) the Initial FMV equals $_____, which is the "Fair Market Value"
per share of Common Stock on the second trading day immediately prior to the
date hereof,

  (ii) the Target FMV equals $_____, which is the Initial FMV
multiplied by 1.2,

 

(iii) the Maturity Date FMV shall equal the "Fair Market Value" per
share of Common Stock on the Maturity Date,

 

(iv) the "Fair Market Value" or "FMV" of the Common Stock shall mean
the average "Closing Sales Price" of the Common Stock over the thirty (30)
trading days immediately preceding the applicable determination date,

 

(v) the "Closing Sale Price" of Common Stock on any date means the
average of the high and low sale price per share of the Common Stock on such
date on the Nasdaq Global Market or such other U.S. securities exchange or
other market on which the Common Stock is listed for trading on such date,
which constitutes the principal U.S. securities market for the Common Stock,
and

 

(vi) the "Maturity Date" shall be the day which is 180 days after the
first anniversary of the Grant Date, provided that if such day is not a
business day, the Maturity Date shall be the first business day thereafter,
subject in each case to Section 3(b).

 

(b) In connection with the settlement of the CVR, the Holder will
provide a certification to the Company that the Holder has complied with
Section 15 of this Agreement. Subject to adjustment as provided herein, the
Company shall pay (the "CVR Payment") to the Holder hereof, on the third
business day following the Maturity Date, an amount per CVR, as reasonably
determined by the Company, (i) equal to 20% of the Initial FMV, if the
Maturity Date FMV is less than the Initial FMV or (ii) equal to the Target
FMV minus the Maturity Date FMV, if the Maturity Date FMV exceeds the Initial
FMV but is less than the Target FMV; provided that to the extent Stock
Appreciation Rights originally granted to the Holder pursuant to the Stock
Appreciation Rights Agreement of even date herewith are exercised on or prior
to the Maturity Date, the amount of the CVR Payment under clause (i) or (ii)
above, as the case may be, relating to each underlying share of Common Stock
associated with such Stock Appreciation Rights will not exceed (1) 20% of the
Initial FMV minus (2) the proceeds from the Stock Appreciation Right relating
to such underlying share of Common Stock. No CVR Payment shall be made if the
Maturity Date FMV equals or exceeds the Target FMV.

 

(c) The CVR Payment, if any, shall be paid by the Company, in its
sole discretion, in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and
shares of Common Stock, provided that in no event shall the number of shares
of Common Stock issuable hereunder (together with all shares of Common Stock
issued pursuant the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Stock Appreciation Rights
granted pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement and the other Contingent
Value Rights issued pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement) exceed
___________ shares of Common Stock (" _Nasdaq Cap_ "), subject to adjustment
as provided herein. If the Nasdaq Cap would be exceeded by the making of a CVR
Payment in shares of Common Stock, then such CVR Payment shall be paid in
cash. For purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon settlement of CVRs, the value of each share of Common Stock
shall equal the Maturity Date FMV. All shares of Common Stock issued upon

 



 

B-2

  settlement of the CVRs shall be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable. The CVRs shall not be represented by separate
certificates, but shall be contract rights hereunder evidenced by a book-entry
system maintained by the Company.

 

      



  |  

3.

  |  

_Certain Adjustments_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

(a) In the event of any extraordinary dividend or any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock or the capital structure of the Company by
reason of any stock dividend, stock split or reverse stock split, exchange of
shares, recapitalization or reclassification of its capital stock, or any
similar change affecting the Companys outstanding shares of capital stock or
capital structure, or any merger, consolidation or other business combination
involving the Company (except as provided in subsection (b)), the Company
shall make appropriate and equitable adjustments to the Initial FMV, the
Target FMV and the Maturity Date FMV, the number and kind of shares or other
property (including cash) to be issued upon settlement of an outstanding CVR,
and the number of shares constituting the Aggregate Base Common Stock (and
CVRs associated therewith).

 

(b) In the event of a merger, consolidation or other business
combination in which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the
merger, consolidation or other business combination will own less than 50% of
the outstanding voting power of the outstanding equity interests of the
surviving entity or its parent or in the event of any transaction or series of
related transactions that results in the acquisition of all or substantially
all of the Companys outstanding Common Stock by a single person or entity or
by a group of persons and/or entities acting in concert, or in the event of
the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Companys assets (all
of the foregoing being referred to as "Acquisition Events"), then (i) the
Maturity Date shall be the earlier of the date otherwise determined under
Section 2(a)(vi) and the date of the Acquisition Event and (ii) the Maturity
Date FMV shall equal the greater of the amount determined under Section
2(a)(iii) and the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors of the Company) of the consideration received for each share of
Common Stock, if applicable, in the Acquisition Event.

 

      



  |  

4.

  |  

_Compliance with Securities Laws_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

(a) The Holder represents and warrants that the Holder is acquiring
the CVRs for the Holders own account and for the purpose of investment and
not with a view to the sale or distribution thereof. The Holder understands
that the CVRs and the shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon
settlement of the CVRs will not have been registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ") or any state securities laws
and that the CVRs and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of

(b) The Holder represents, covenants, and agrees that the Holder will
not assign its rights hereunder or sell or otherwise dispose of the CVRs or of

disposition. The

 



 

B-3

  certificates representing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement

applicable federal and state securities laws.

 

(c) The Company agrees that it will comply with the provisions of
Section 1.7 of the Stock Purchase Agreement relating to the registration of
the resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of the CVRs.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Company has no obligation to

5. _Reservation of Shares_. During the term of the CVRs, to the extent that the Company has not determined to make any CVR Payment in cash, the Company shall at all times reserve and keep available from its authorized but unissued or treasury shares such number of shares of its Common Stock as shall be issuable upon settlement of the CVRs.

 

6. _Notices_. Any notice or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder shall be delivered by hand or by reputable express courier or sent by certified or registered mail to the Holder at the last address shown on the books of the Company maintained for the registry and transfer of the CVRs. 

 

7. _No Rights as Stockholder_. A Holder shall not be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder of Common Stock with respect to, any shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement of the CVRs until such shares, if any, are actually issued. 

 

8. _Withholding_. The settlement of CVRs shall be subject to any required withholding under applicable federal, state, local or foreign tax laws, and the amount of such withholding shall be the responsibility of the Holder.

14. _Assignment_. The Holder may not assign its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, or transfer the CVRs associated herewith without the prior written consent of the Company, except an assignment and transfer in connection with the assignment and transfer of Stock Appreciation Rights of Holder in accordance with the terms of the Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement of even date herewith. Upon any assignment and transfer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the transferee shall be the "Holder" for purposes of this Agreement, and shall have all of the rights and obligations of the Holder hereunder.

 

15. _Prohibition on Certain Transactions_. Each Holder and each direct or indirect assignee under this Agreement, on behalf of itself and its affiliates, successors and assigns, agrees that it will not, at any time prior to the close of business on the Maturity Date, directly or indirectly, offer to "short sell", contract to "short sell" or otherwise "short sell" or encourage others to "short sell" any securities of the Company, including, without limitation, shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, any capital markets transaction executed on a Holders behalf by an investment bank, hedge fund, market maker or other transaction facilitator in connection with the monetization of shares of Common Stock of the Company shall not constitute a breach or violation of this Section, even if such capital markets transaction itself involves a "short-sell."; provided, neither Holder may directly engage in a "short sale". For purposes of this Agreement, "short selling" shall include any sale (excluding the sale of shares of Aggregate Base Common Stock at least 90 days prior to the Maturity Date), any trade in any option or other derivative security, any hedging transaction relating to the securities of the Company or any other transaction intended to affect the price of the Common Stock. Each Holder represents and warrants to the Company, and it shall be condition to any Transfer hereunder that each direct or indirect transferee represent and warrant to the Company that as of the time of the Transfer, neither it nor any of its affiliates holds or is a party to any option, security, instrument or agreement that would violate the provisions of this Section if acquired after the time it becomes a party to this Agreement. Without limiting the remedies of the Company as a result of any breach, if any Holder breaches the restrictions of this Section on short selling, such Holder will forfeit and relinquish to the Company without consideration one CVR for each share that such Holder short sells in breach of this Section; provided that if any Holder engages in a sale (but not a short sale) of any shares of Aggregate Base Common Stock at a time that such sale is prohibited by this Section, then the forfeiture provided by this sentence shall be the sole remedy as a result of such breach. 

 

16. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement represents the entire understanding and agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all other negotiations, understandings and representations (if any) made by and among such parties.

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused this Agreement to
be executed as of the day and year first above written.

THE STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS EVIDENCED BY THIS STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
AGREEMENT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED, OR UNDER ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A
WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL, REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, TO THE
EFFECT THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER APPLICABLE FEDERAL
AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS

 

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

 

THIS STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of
the ___ day of ___________, 2007 by and between Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (the "
_Company_ ") and ______________________________ (the " _Holder_ "). (The
Company and Holder are sometimes individually referred to as a "Party" and
collectively as the "Parties").

 

WHEREAS, the Company and the Holder are parties to that certain Stock Purchase
Agreement dated November 21, 2006 (" _Stock Purchase Agreement_ "), pursuant
to which the Company agreed that it would grant to Holder certain stock
appreciation rights with respect to certain shares of the Companys common
stock, par value $0.02 per share (the " _Common Stock_ ") whereby Holder would
have the right to participate in any increase in the value of such shares of
Common Stock (individually as to an increase in value for each such share of
Common Stock, an " _SAR_ " and collectively " _SARs_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to enter into this Agreement to set forth the
terms and conditions of the SARs.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein and
in the Stock Purchase Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 

1. _Grant of SARs_. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to Holder One (1) SAR per share with respect to _____ shares of Common Stock (" _Initial Shares_ ") issued to Holder under the Stock Purchase Agreement on the date hereof [$100 million of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to Section 1.3 of the Stock Purchase Agreement as designated by the Company]. Each SAR represents the right to participate in an increase in the value of one (1) share of Common Stock. The Holder shall be entitled to receive, for each SAR granted hereunder and subsequently exercised, an amount payable in Common Stock equal to the excess of the "Fair Market Value", as hereinafter defined, per share of the Common Stock on the date of exercise over $_____, which is the "Fair Market Value" per share of Common Stock on the second trading day immediately prior to the date hereof (" _Initial Fair Market Value_ "); and provided that in no event shall the number of shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder (together with all shares of Common Stock issued pursuant the Stock Purchase Agreement, the other SARs granted pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Contingent Value Rights granted pursuant to the Stock 

  Purchase Agreement) exceed ___________ shares of Common Stock (" _Nasdaq Cap_
"), subject to adjustment as provided herein. Each unexercised SAR granted
under this Agreement shall lapse immediately upon such issuance of a number of
such shares of Common Stock equal to the Nasdaq Cap, and no additional SARs
shall be granted under this Agreement on or after such time. For purposes of
determining the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
SARs, the value of the shares of Common Stock to be issued shall be their
"Fair Market Value" on the date of exercise of the respective SARs. The Holder
will be entitled to cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock
otherwise issuable based upon the "Fair Market Value" of the shares on the
date of exercise. The minimum number of SARs that may be exercised at any time
is the lesser of (a) Ten Thousand (10,000) SARs or (b) the number of SARs
then owned by the Holder. The SARs shall not be represented by separate
certificates, but shall be contract rights hereunder evidenced by a book-entry
system maintained by the Company.

 

2. _Fair Market Value_ _._ For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Fair Market Value_ " of the Common Stock shall mean the average "Closing Sales Price" of the Common Stock over the last thirty (30) trading days immediately preceding the applicable determination date. The " _Closing Sale Price_ " of Common Stock on any date means the average of the high and low sale price per share of the Common Stock on such date on the Nasdaq Global Market or such other U.S. securities exchange or other market on which the Common Stock is listed for trading on such date, which constitutes the principal U.S. securities market for the Common Stock.

---|---|--- 
 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the SARs
shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time
from and after the date of grant until the close of business on the Expiration
Date. The " _Expiration Date_ " shall be the day which is 180 days after the
first anniversary of the date hereof, provided that if such day is not a
business day, the Expiration Date shall be the first business day thereafter,
subject to Section 4(b). All rights with respect to any unexercised SARs shall
expire, and the SARs shall become null and void at the close of business on
the Expiration Date.

 

(b) In order to exercise the SARs in whole or in part, the Holder
shall complete the "Notice of Intention to Exercise SARs" attached hereto (the
" _Notice Form_ "), and deliver the completed Notice Form to the Legal
Department of the Company at the Companys office located at 4601 College
Boulevard, Suite 300, Leawood, Kansas 66211 (or such other office or agency of
the Company as the Company may designate by notice in writing to the Holder).

 

(c) As soon as practicable after exercise of SARs, the Company shall
cause to be issued and delivered to the Holder (i) a certificate or
certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such SARs, all of which shares shall be duly
authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, (b) cash in lieu
of any fractional share and (c) any other securities or property (including
cash) to which such Holder may be entitled upon such exercise pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. Each stock certificate representing shares of Common
Stock so issued and delivered shall be registered in the name of the Holder.

_Certain Adjustments_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

(a) In the event of any extraordinary dividend or any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock or the capital structure of the Company by
reason of any stock dividend, stock split or reverse stock split, exchange of
shares, recapitalization or reclassification of its capital stock, or any
similar change affecting the Companys outstanding shares of capital stock or
capital structure, or any merger, consolidation or other business combination
involving the Company (except as provided in subsection (b)), the Company
shall make appropriate and equitable adjustments to the aggregate number and
kind of shares which thereafter may be issued under this Agreement under the
Nasdaq Cap, the number and kind of shares or other property (including cash)
to be issued upon exercise of an outstanding SAR granted under this
Agreement, the number of shares constituting the Initial Shares (and SARs
associated therewith) and the Initial Fair Market Value per share for any
Initial Share.

 

(b) In the event of a merger, consolidation or other business
combination in which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the
merger, consolidation or other business combination will own less than 50% of
the outstanding voting power of the outstanding equity interests of the
surviving entity or its parent or in the event of any transaction or series of
related transactions that results in the acquisition of all or substantially
all of the Companys outstanding Common Stock by a single person or entity or
by a group of persons and/or entities acting in concert, or in the event of
the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Companys assets (all
of the foregoing being referred to as " _Acquisition Events_ "), then the
Company may, in its sole discretion, terminate all outstanding SARs, effective
as of the date of the Acquisition Event, by delivering notice of termination
to Holder at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of consummation of the
Acquisition Event; provided, that during the period from the date on which
such notice of termination is delivered to the consummation of the Acquisition
Event, the Holder shall have the right to exercise in full, subject to the
limitations in Section 1, all of the SARs that are then outstanding as of the
date immediately preceding the date of the Acquisition Event, which exercise
may be contingent on the occurrence of the Acquisition Event, and further
provided that, if the Acquisition Event does not take place within a specified
period after giving such notice for any reason whatsoever, the notice and
exercise shall be null and void. In the event of an Acquisition Event, the
Expiration Date shall be the earlier of the date of the Acquisition Event or
the date specified in Section 3(a).

_Assignment_. 

---|---|--- 
 

 

(a) The Holder, and each indirect or indirect transferee
(collectively, the " _Transferor_ "), may not assign its rights under this
Agreement, in whole or in part, or transfer the SARs associated herewith
(collectively, a " _Transfer_ ") without the prior written consent of the
Company, except upon compliance with the following provisions:

 

(i) The Transferor shall concurrently Transfer to the transferee a
number of Contingent Value Rights ("CVRs"), which CVRs were originally granted
to the Transferor pursuant to the Contingent Value Rights Agreement of even
date herewith, that is equal to the number of SARs transferred. Any Transfer
hereunder may be made only for cash or cash equivalents.

 

(ii) Prior to any Transfer, the Transferor shall deliver to the
Company a written notice (by written notice to the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company with a copy to the Legal Department at the Companys principal
office) which shall set forth (A) a description of the intended transferee,
which need not be a specific identification, (B) the amount and form of
consideration to be received in exchange for the SARs and CVRs, (C) the
intended manner of Transfer, and (D) any other terms and conditions of the
proposed Transfer ("Disposition Notice"), together with a copy of any written
agreement, letter of intent, form of offer or similar document relating to the
proposed Transfer (but with redactions of the identity of the intended
transferee, in the Transferors discretion).. The Transferor shall also
promptly provide such further information with respect to the Transfer as is
reasonably requested by the Company. The date as of which the Company has
received the Disposition Notice and the other documents and information
required hereunder is referred to as the " _Notice Date_ ".

 

(iii) Upon receipt of the Disposition Notice, the Company shall have the
right and option (" _Purchase Option_ ") to purchase all, but not less than
all, of the SARs and CVRs subject to the Disposition Notice for cash. The
Company may exercise such Purchase Option at any time by giving the Transferor
written notice of exercise prior to the close of business on the second
business day following the Notice Date (" _Option Expiration Date_ "). Upon
exercise of the Purchase Option, the Company and the Transferor shall be
legally obligated to consummate the purchase and sale of the SARs and CVRs
upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Company does not
exercise the Purchase Option prior to the close of business on the Option
Expiration Date, the Purchase Option shall expire at such time. The

 



 

C-5

  purchase price payable by the Company for the SARs and CVRs shall be the
consideration for the SARs and CVRs set forth in the Disposition Notice.

 

(iv) The closing of any purchase of SARs or CVRs by the Company ("
_Closing_ ") under this Section shall take place at 10:00 a.m. local time, on
the date ten (10) business days after the giving of the Disposition Notice to
the Company, at the principal office of the Company, unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by the Company and the Transferor. At the Closing, the Company
shall pay the purchase price by wire transfer of immediately available funds
and the Company and Holder shall sign appropriate agreements amending or
terminating this Agreement and the Contingent Value Rights Agreement between
the parties relating to termination of the respective SARs and CVRs.

 

(v) If the Company does not exercise the Purchase Option prior to the
close of business on the Option Expiration Date, the Transferor shall be free,
for a period of ten (10) days after the Option Expiration Date, to make the
Transfer of the SARs and CVRs, at the price and on the terms specified in the
Disposition Notice, to the person or persons listed in the Disposition Notice.
If the Transferor shall fail to so Transfer such SARs and CVRs within such ten
(10) day period, the Transferor may not Transfer such SARs and CVRs without
giving a new Disposition Notice and again complying with the terms of this
Section. The Holder shall promptly give the Company notice of the name and
valid contact information for Transferee.

 

(b) A Transfer under this Section shall not be effective, and shall be
void and of no effect, unless the transferee shall agree in writing to be
fully bound by all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the
Contingent Value Rights Agreement entered into with the Holder on the date
hereof. Upon any Transfer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
transferee shall be the "Holder" for purposes of this Agreement, and shall
have all of the rights and obligations of the Holder hereunder.

 

16. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement represents the entire understanding and agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all other negotiations, understandings and representations (if any) made by and among such parties.

executed as of the day and year first above written.
