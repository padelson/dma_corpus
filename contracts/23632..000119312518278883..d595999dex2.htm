Section 2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Preliminary Adjustment Certificate_. Seller shall deliver the Preliminary
Adjustment Certificate to Buyer no later than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

(b) _Closing Adjustment Certificate_. Within sixty (60) days after
the Closing, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer the Closing Adjustment
Certificate; _provided_ , that if Seller does not deliver the Closing
Adjustment Certificate within such time period, then the Preliminary
Adjustment Certificate shall be deemed to be the Closing Adjustment
Certificate. Buyer and Seller shall provide to each other such data and
information as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation and review of the Closing Adjustment Certificate.

(c) _Notice of Disagreement_. The Closing Adjustment Certificate shall become
final and binding upon the Parties on the date that is thirty (30) days after
(i) the delivery of the Closing Adjustment Certificate by Seller, or (ii) the
expiration of the sixty (60)-day time period specified in  _Section_ __ _
2.4(b)_ in the event Seller does not deliver a Closing Adjustment Certificate
within such time period (the " _Final Settlement Date_ ") unless Buyer gives
written notice of its disagreement (" _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Seller
prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable
detail the dollar amount, nature and basis of any such disagreement. If a
Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller, then the Closing Adjustment
Certificate (as revised in accordance with paragraph (d) below, if applicable)
shall become final and binding on the Parties on, and the Final Settlement
Date shall be, the earlier of (i) the date upon which Seller and Buyer agree
in writing with respect to all matters specified in the Closing Adjustment
Certificate and (ii) the date upon which the Final Adjustment Certificate is
issued by the Independent Accounting Firm.

 

(d) _Final Adjustment Certificate_. During the first twenty (20) days after
the date upon which Seller receives a Notice of Disagreement, the Parties
shall attempt to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with
respect to all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end
of such twenty (20)-day period (or earlier by mutual agreement to arbitrate)
the Parties have not reached agreement, the matters that remain in dispute may
be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by either Seller or Buyer for
review and resolution. The hearing date shall be scheduled by the Independent
Accounting Firm as soon as reasonably practicable, and shall be conducted on a
confidential basis. Seller and Buyer shall, not later than seven (7) days
prior to the hearing date set by the Independent Accounting Firm, submit a
brief (to include their respective calculations with regard to amounts in
dispute on the Closing Adjustment Certificate) for settlement of any amounts
set forth in the Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute. The Parties
shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to render a decision (which
decision shall include a written statement of findings and conclusions,
including a written explanation of its reasoning with respect to such findings
and conclusions) resolving the matters in dispute in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_, and the Final Adjustment Certificate reflecting such
decision, within ten (10) Business Days after the conclusion of the
hearing, unless the Parties reach agreement prior thereto and withdraw the
dispute from arbitration. The Independent Accounting Firm shall (i) act as an
independent accounting firm and not as an expert, (ii) address only those
items in dispute and, (iii) for each item, not assign a value greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either Seller or Buyer or smaller
than the smallest value for such item claimed by

 



20

    

 either Seller or Buyer. The decision of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be final and binding on the Parties. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_ shall
be borne by the Parties in inverse proportion to their respective success on
the merits and such allocation of fees and expenses shall be calculated by the
Independent Accounting Firm and shall be final and binding on the Parties.
For example, if Sellers computation of the Adjustment Amount set forth on the
Closing Adjustment Certificate is different from the Adjustment Amount set
forth on the Final Adjustment Certificate as adjusted by the Independent
Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_ by ten percent (10%),
and Buyers computation of the Adjustment Amount set forth on the Notice of
Disagreement is different from the Adjustment Amount set forth on the Final
Adjustment Certificate by five percent (5%), then two-thirds of the fees and
expenses relating to the appointment of the Independent Accounting Firm and
the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm will be
paid by Seller and one-third of such fees and expenses shall be paid by Buyer.
As used in this Agreement, the term " _Final Adjustment Certificate_ "
shall mean the Closing Adjustment Certificate delivered (or deemed delivered)
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_, as subsequently adjusted, if applicable,
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_ to reflect any subsequent written
agreement between the Parties with respect thereto and, if submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm, any amendments or modifications to the Closing
Adjustment Certificate decided by the Independent Accounting Firm.

 

(e) _Final Settlement and Adjustment to Purchase Price; Payment_.

 

(i) (x) If the Adjustment Amount set forth on the Final Adjustment Certificate
is a positive amount, then the Purchase Price shall equal the Preliminary
Purchase Price decreased by an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount set forth
on the Final Adjustment Certificate (an " _Excess Payment_ ") and (y) if the
Adjustment Amount set forth on the Final Adjustment Certificate is a negative
number, then the Purchase Price shall equal the Preliminary Purchase Price
increased by an amount equal to the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount
set forth on the Final Adjustment Certificate (a " _Shortfall Payment_ ").

(ii) Any Shortfall Payment shall be paid by Buyer to Seller, and any Excess
Payment shall be paid by Seller to Buyer, in each case, not later than three
(3) Business Days after the Final Settlement Date by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts specified by Buyer or
Seller, as applicable. The amount of any payment to be made after the Closing
Date pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(e)(ii)_ shall bear interest from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a floating
rate per annum (accruing daily and computed on the basis of a year of three
hundred sixty (360) days and the actual number of days elapsed) initially
equal to the 3-Month LIBOR Rate determined as of the Closing Date,
and adjusting on each three month anniversary of the Closing Date to the
3-Month LIBOR Rate determined as of such anniversary date. Such interest shall
be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates.

 



21

    

Section 2.5 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) The Parties agree to allocate the Purchase Price (and any liabilities
taken into account as consideration for the Company Interests
under applicable Tax Law) among the Interests of the Company Entities and,
further, for purposes of Section 1060 or Sections 743, 751 and 755 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any comparable or
similar provisions of applicable state and local Tax Law), as the case may
be, to allocate the portion of the Purchase Price (including any liabilities
taking into account as consideration for the Company Interests under
applicable Tax Law) allocated to the Interests of the applicable Company
Entity among the separate classes of assets of such Company Entity in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

 

(b) No later than sixty (60) days after the Final Settlement Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to Seller a proposed allocation (the " _Proposed
Allocation_ ") consistent with _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_. If Seller disagrees
with any items reflected in the Proposed Allocation, then Seller shall notify
Buyer in writing of such disputed items within sixty (60) days after receipt
thereof, and, thereafter, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to
resolve such disputed items for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer
period as mutually agreed by the Parties). To the extent that Seller and
Buyer are unable to resolve any disputed items, the Parties shall jointly
submit any remaining disputed items for resolution to the Independent
Accounting Firm, and shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to render
its decision (which decision shall include a written statement of findings
and conclusions, including a written explanation of its reasoning with respect
to such findings and conclusions) resolving the matters in dispute in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ within thirty (30) days after such
firm is retained, which decision shall be final and binding on the Parties.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall be borne by the Parties in inverse proportion to
their respective success on the merits, and such allocation of fees and
expenses shall be calculated by the Independent Accounting Firm and shall be
final and binding on the Parties. The purchase price allocation as finally
agreed or determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall be the "
_Final Allocation_."

 

(c) The Final Allocation, as adjusted to take into account any subsequent
adjustments to the Purchase Price (and any liabilities taken into account as
consideration for the Company Interests under applicable Tax Law), shall be
binding on the Buyer, the Company Entities and Seller and their respective
Affiliates for all Tax purposes. The Buyer, the Company Entities and Seller
and their respective Affiliates shall report, act, and file Tax Returns
(including IRS Form 8594, IRS Form 8308 and the informational statements
required pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.743-1(k)(1)(i) and
1.751-1(a)(3), as applicable) in all respects and for all purposes consistent
with the Final Allocation and shall not take any position contrary thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall be construed so
as to prevent any Party from settling, or require any Party to commence or
participate in any litigation or administrative process challenging any
determination made by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of
the Final Allocation.

Section 2.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
responsibility for any and all Transfer Taxes imposed as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be divided equally between
Buyer and Seller. To the extent that either Party pays more than its
respective equal share of Transfer Taxes, the other Party shall promptly
reimburse such Party for such excess amount paid upon receipt by such other
Party of reasonably satisfactory evidence of the amount of such Transfer Taxes
and payment thereof by such Party. The Parties will reasonably cooperate in
the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns or other documentation in
connection with any Transfer Taxes subject to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,
including joining in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation to the extent required by Law.

For all purposes of this _Article III_ and _Article IV_ , the representations
and warranties of Seller shall be qualified by (i) the actual effect of any
PGandE Condition or Bankruptcy Event to the extent they are actually affected,
directly or indirectly, by a PGandE Condition or Bankruptcy Event and (ii) the

(b) Each Non-JV Company Entity is duly qualified or licensed to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensure necessary, except in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have more than an Material Adverse Effect on the Company
Entities, taken as a whole.

 

Section 3.2 _Noncontravention_. Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of Buyer set forth in _Article V_ , neither the execution and

which it is or will be a party, nor the consummation by Seller of the

(c) assuming receipt of the Consents of Governmental Authorities described in
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_, violates any Law to which any Company Entity is subject,
except, in the case of each of clauses (b) and (c), for such violations or
breaches as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a liability material to any Company Entity or otherwise
impair materially the operation of the business of any Company Entity.

 



23

    

Section 3.3 _Capitalization_. _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of the Company Entities, and with respect to each

to any Rights or Contracts that would require Seller or such Company Entity to
sell, transfer, issue or otherwise dispose of any Interests of the Company

respects, respectively, the financial position and statements of operations

rather than historical basis.

 



24

    

(b) As of the Closing, the Company Entities set forth on  _Section_ __ _
3.6(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall have no direct material assets
or liabilities other than (i) Liabilities arising from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents and (ii)
the equity of any other Company Entity.

Section 3.7 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Non-JV Company Entities have no
Liabilities that would be required under GAAP to be reflected or reserved

whole, except for (a) Liabilities set forth, reflected in, reserved against or

Affiliate of Seller) since the Balance Sheet Date, (c) Liabilities that are

Liabilities under Contracts of the Non-JV Company Entities (other than as a

payment of any non-cash or in-kind dividend or other distribution of
Interests or property other than cash or cash equivalents with respect to the
Company Interests, (iii) there has not been any change in accounting methods,

required or permitted by GAAP, and (iv) there has not been any change, event
or development that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Company Entities. Since the Balance Sheet
Date, neither Seller, nor any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries has
caused (i) any part of the solar electric generating facility or electric
energy storage facility development business of Seller or its Affiliates, or
(ii) any of the material assets comprising such facilities under development,
to be transferred to any Person (other than a Company Entity) pursuant to the
Restructuring.

Section 3.9 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each Non-JV Company Entity has (i) timely filed, or caused to be timely
filed, all material federal, state and local Tax Returns that were required
to be filed by or with respect to it with the IRS or other applicable Taxing
Authority on or prior to the date hereof, taking into account all permitted
extensions. Seller has timely filed all material federal, state and local Tax
Returns required to be filed with the IRS or other applicable Taxing Authority
with respect to the Company Interests. All such Tax Returns are correct and
complete in all material respects. There are no Liens for Taxes on any of the
assets of any Non-JV Company Entity other than Permitted Liens.

(b) All material Taxes due and payable by each Non-JV Company, or by Seller
or its Affiliates (other than the Company Entities) with respect to each
Company Entity or the Company Interests, have been paid, except Taxes that
are being contested in good faith and for which reserves have been established
in accordance with GAAP in the Financial Statements.

 



25

    

(c) There are no outstanding or unsettled written claims, asserted
deficiencies or assessments against any Non-JV Company Entity for the
assessment or collection of any material Taxes. There are no ongoing or
scheduled audits, examinations or other administrative or judicial proceedings
with respect to any material Taxes of any Non-JV Company Entity being
conducted with respect to any Non-JV Company. Except as set forth on 
_Section_ __ _ 3.9(c)_ to the Seller Disclosure Schedule, none of the Non-JV
Company Entities is a party to any Tax indemnification, Tax allocation, Tax
sharing or similar agreement (other than any (i) Governing Document of any
Non-JV Company Entity, (ii) customary Tax gross up provision in a financing
document or lease or (iii) commercial agreement entered into in the
ordinary course of business that is not primarily related to Taxes).

(d) The U.S. federal income tax classification of each Non-JV Company Entity
is set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.9_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 

(e) To Sellers Knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist (in each case that
are specific to the Non-JV Company that directly or indirectly owns the Great
Valley Solar Project) that would reasonably be expected to cause the Great
Valley Solar Project not to qualify for the California Section 73 exclusion
during Tax periods prior to the Closing.

(f) Assuming the truth and accuracy of the representations set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 5.12_ of this Agreement, the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in any Adverse ITC Impact.

sole and exclusive representations and warranties of Seller relating to Taxes
of any Company Entity, and no other representation or warranty in this
Agreement shall be construed to apply to any matter relating to Taxes of any
Company Entity. The representations and warranties set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.9_ (i) are made only with respect to Tax periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) shall not be construed as a
representation or warranty, and shall not be relied upon for any claim
of indemnification with respect to, (x) any Taxes of Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Company Entities) attributable to any Tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, (y) any Tax positions taken by the
Buyers or their Affiliates (including the Company Entities) in any Tax period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or (z) any Taxes or
direct or indirect Liabilities arising from or related to any California
Property Tax Assessment Event.

site reviews and all communications with any Person in an expeditious and
efficient manner; and (B) except to the extent resulting from the negligence

their respective Representatives by reason of applicable Law, which
constitutes or allows access to information protected by attorney-client
privilege, or which Seller or its Affiliates (or, prior to the Closing, the

reason of any Contract with a third party or which would otherwise expose
Seller or its Affiliates (or, prior to the Closing, the Company Entities) to
a material risk of Liability.

confidence all confidential information obtained from Seller, the Company
Entities or their respective Affiliates or Representatives, whether or not

Company Entitys Governing Documents, the Parties shall cause such
Company Entity to use the "interim closing method" and "calendar day
convention" (in each case as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.706-4)
for purposes of allocating tax items of such Company Entity to the portion of
such tax year ending on the Closing Date and beginning after the Closing Date,
respectively.

(b) Seller shall cause each Company Entity (other than any JV Project Company

such Company Entity for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date

each case, in accordance with the Governing Documents of such Company Entity
(or, in the case of the JV Project Companies, as such Governing Documents are
in effect prior to the Closing) and consistent with the past practices of such
Company Entity and Buyer agrees not to object to the preparation of such
Tax Returns on behalf of Seller by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Buyer shall

effect prior to the Closing) and consistent with the past practices of such JV
Project Company. Buyer also shall cause each Company Entity to prepare and
file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax Returns of such Company
Entity for any Straddle Period (a " _Straddle Period Return_ "), in each case,
in accordance with the Governing Documents of such Company Entity (or, in the
case of the JV Project Companies, as such Governing Documents are in effect
prior to the Closing) and consistent with the past practices of such Company
Entity. In the case of any JV Project Company, Seller shall be entitled to
exercise all rights (and shall be subject to any obligations) of Seller (or
its Affiliates (including any Company Entity prior to the Closing)) as a
"member" under the Governing Documents of such JV Project Company as in
effect prior to the Closing with respect to the review, approval and filing
of any Pre-Closing Tax Return prepared by Buyer and any Straddle Period Return
of such JV Project Company that is an income Tax Return or other material Tax
Return. In the case of any Non-JV Company Entity, Seller shall be entitled to
exercise all rights (and shall be subject to any obligations) of Buyer (or any
Affiliates (including the Company Entities following the Closing) or
Representative thereof) with respect to the review, approval and filing of any
Straddle Period Return of such Non-JV Company Entity that is an income Tax
Return or other material Tax Return. To the extent not otherwise provided (or
required to be provided) to Seller pursuant to the Governing Documents of the
applicable Company Entity, Buyer shall provide Seller with a draft of
each Pre-Closing Tax Return prepared by Buyer and each Straddle Period Return
or other material Tax Return at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
thereof (including extensions) for Sellers review and comment, and subject
to the Governing Documents of the applicable Company Entity (or, in the case
of the JV Company Entities, as such Governing Documents are in effect prior to
the Closing), Buyer shall incorporate Sellers reasonable comments.

(c) Seller shall not be responsible for any California Property Tax Assessment
Event or any Taxes resulting therefrom.

(d) From and after the Closing Date, without Sellers consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, none of Buyer, any of its

shall (i) amend or approve or consent to the amendment of any Pre-Closing
Return or Straddle Period Return, (ii) make, change, approve or consent to
any Tax election with respect to any Company Entity, or take or fail to take
any action with respect to any such entity, in each case, that reasonably
would be expected to increase the Taxes of Seller or its Affiliates or
beneficial owners for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or
any Straddle Period, or (iii) agree or consent to the amendment of any
Governing Document, or the waiver of any right or obligation of any Company
Entity under, any Governing Document of, any Company Entity that reasonably
would be expected to impair or adversely affect the right of Seller hereunder
to exercise the rights of Buyer (or its Affiliate (including the Company
Entities following the Closing) or any Representative thereof) as provided in
_Sections 6.7(b_ ) or _6.7(e)_.

(e) Seller and Buyer shall notify the other within ten (10) days of the
receipt by Seller or Buyer (or any of their Affiliates), as applicable, of
notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with
respect to Taxes of or with respect to any Company Entity for which Seller
(or any of its Affiliates) may be liable pursuant to this Agreement, directly
on a pass-through basis (such as income Taxes) or otherwise (a " _Tax
Proceeding_ "); _provided_ , 

 



44

    

  _however_ , no failure or delay in providing notice of a Tax Proceeding
shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Party
under this Agreement, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced thereby. From and after Closing, in the case of any Tax Proceeding
with respect to a JV Project Company any Tax period that ends on or before, or
that includes, the Closing Date, Seller shall be entitled to exercise all
rights (and shall be subject to any obligations) of Seller (or its Affiliate
(including any Company Entity prior to the Closing)) as a "member" under the
Governing Documents of such JV Project Company as in effect prior to the
Closing (including the right to act as tax matters partner or partnership
representative if and as provided therein), with respect to the control and
defense of such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, if Buyer would be liable
for any material Taxes with respect to any such Tax Proceeding, if Seller
controls such Tax Proceeding, Seller shall (i) permit Buyer to participate (at
its own expense) in such Tax Proceeding, (ii) keep Buyer reasonably informed
of the developments and status of such Tax Proceeding, and (iii) not settle
or compromise any such Tax proceeding without Buyers consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the case of any Tax
Proceeding with respect to a Non-JV Company Entity, Seller shall be entitled
to exercise all rights (and shall be subject to any obligations) of Buyer (or
any Affiliate (including the Company Entities following the Closing) or
Representative thereof) pursuant to the Governing Documents of the applicable
Non-JV Company Entity (including the right to act as tax matters partner or
partnership representative if and as provided therein), with respect to the
control and defense of such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, if Buyer would
be liable for any material Taxes with respect to any such Tax Proceeding, if
Seller controls such Tax Proceeding, Seller shall (i) permit Buyer to
participate (at its own expense) in such Tax Proceeding, (ii) keep Buyer
reasonably informed of the developments and status of such Tax Proceeding, and
(iii) not settle or compromise any such Tax proceeding without Buyers
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If

shall (i) permit Seller to participate (at its own expense) in such Tax
Proceeding, (ii) keep Seller reasonably informed of developments and the
status of such Tax Proceeding and (iii) not settle or compromise such Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of Seller, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event of any conflict
between the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(e)_ and _Section_ __ _
8.3_ (to the extent applicable), this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(e)_ shall control.

 

(f) Except to the extent specifically included in Adjusted Working Capital (as
finalized pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_), Seller shall be entitled to an
amount equal to the product of (i) the relevant Applicable Percentage and (ii)
any Tax refunds or credits received by or credited to Buyer or its Affiliates
(including any Company Entity following the Closing) with respect to any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date
(collectively, " _Tax Refunds_ "). Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Seller the amount of Sellers share of any Tax Refund (plus any interest
actually received with respect thereto from an applicable Governmental
Authority), net of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
Taxes) incurred in connection with receiving such Tax Refund, within ten (10)
days of receipt of such Tax Refund.

(g) Any Tax-sharing, Tax allocation or Tax reimbursement agreement between
Sempra Energy or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Non-JV Company
Entity, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date.

 



45

    

(h) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
provide to the other party such cooperation and information, as and to the
extent reasonably requested and reasonably necessary, in connection with (i)
preparing, reviewing or filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for
refund of or with respect to the Company Entities, (ii) determining
Liabilities for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes of or with respect to the

for federal income tax purposes as a C corporation to either (i) file an

income tax purposes under Section 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii), or (ii) in the case of
Rabley Holdings, Inc., cause such Company Entity to convert into, or merge
into, a limited liability company that is treated as an entity disregarded
from its owner for federal income tax purposes under Treasury
Regulations Section 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii).

Section 6.8 _Insurance_. From and after the Closing Date (i) the Company
Entities shall cease to be insured by, have access or availability to, be
entitled to make claims on, be entitled to claim benefits or seek coverage
under, any of Sellers or its Affiliates insurance policies or any of their
self-insured programs and (ii) Buyer shall be solely responsible for obtaining
or providing insurance coverage for the Company Entities for any event or
occurrence after the Closing sufficient to comply with any and all of the
contractual and statutory obligations of the Company Entities.

Section 6.9 _Support Obligations_. At Buyers sole risk, cost and expense,
Buyer shall take all steps necessary, including offering substitute
guarantees, letters of credit, cash or similar support of or procured by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates and related certificates and legal opinions, and
Seller shall cooperate (it being understood that such cooperation shall not
include any requirement to pay any consideration or offer or grant any
financial accommodation) in all reasonable respects with Buyer, to ensure
that, effective as of the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates (other than
any Company Entity) shall be released from all obligations and Liabilities
relating to or arising under or out of or in connection with each Support
Obligation. Without limiting Buyers obligations under the preceding
sentence, if such requirements are not satisfied as of the Closing Date, then
subject to acceptance by Seller in its reasonable discretion, Buyer or its
Affiliates shall, in lieu of causing such release of Seller and its
Affiliates from such Support Obligations, enter into such indemnification and
reimbursement agreements (including the provision of letters of credit, cash,

Section 6.10 _Employee Relations and Benefits_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, Seller Parent
and its Affiliates shall retain sponsorship of, and shall retain and
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates against, all Liabilities
under, the Benefit Plans, whether arising before, on or after the Closing, and
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not assume sponsorship of, contribute to or
maintain, or have any Liability with respect to, the Benefit Plans.

(b) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, offer employment to Company
Employees currently employed in the positions set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.10(b)_ of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule. Such offers of employment to the
Company Employees shall be made no later than twenty (20) days prior to the
Closing Date and shall provide for such employment to be effective as of
12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date. Each Company Employee who receives and accepts
an offer of employment from Buyer or one of its Affiliates and actually
commences employment with Buyer or an Affiliate on or after the Closing Date
is referred to herein as a " _Continuing Employee_." Seller Parent hereby
authorizes Buyer and its Affiliates to enter into discussions with the Company
Employees regarding employment with Buyer or its Affiliates as contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_. Buyer and its Affiliates shall comply with
all applicable Laws relating to the foregoing offers of employment to, and
continuation of employment of, the Company Employees on and after the
Closing. Buyer shall assume liability for, and fully indemnify and hold
harmless Seller Parent and its Affiliates with respect to, any Liability
incurred by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates pursuant to applicable
Laws or otherwise, including without limitation, the WARN Act, in connection
with any Company Employee, to the extent such liability arises from actions of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates on or after the Closing or with respect to
the actions described in the immediately preceding sentences (including the
selection and hiring of Company Employees). Nothing herein shall be construed
as a representation or guarantee by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates
that any particular Company Employee shall accept Buyers offer of employment
or shall continue in employment with Buyer or its Affiliates following the
Closing.

 

(c) For a period of not less than one (1) year following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each Continuing
Employee with the severance benefits set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule. For purposes of this covenant and the
severance plans of Buyer and its Affiliates, such Continuing Employee shall
be credited for service with Seller Parent and its Affiliates as described in
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(d)_ and for service with Buyer and its Affiliates
following the Closing Date. 

(d) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall give each Continuing Employee full
credit for all purposes, including eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, vesting and benefit accrual, under any employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements (including severance and vacation/paid time off
policies (and any accruals thereunder)) provided, sponsored, maintained
or contributed to by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (" _Buyer Plans_ ") for
such Continuing Employees service with Seller Parent or its Affiliates prior
to the Closing, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent
recognized by Seller Parent or such Affiliates, except to the extent such
credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of
service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, Buyer shall not be required to provide credit for such
service for benefit accrual purposes under any Buyer Plan that is a defined
benefit pension plan.

(e) Buyer shall (i) waive or cause to be waived for each Continuing Employee
and his or her dependents, any waiting period provision, payment requirement
to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-
work requirement, evidence of insurability requirement and any other
restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under
the welfare plans of Buyer or any of its Affiliates applicable to such
Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing condition
limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other restriction would not have
been applicable (or was previously satisfied by) to such Continuing

 



47

    

 Employee under the terms of the comparable Benefit Plan, and (ii) give or
cause to be given full credit under the Buyer Plans applicable to each
Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all out-of-pocket or other
co-payments and deductibles under any Benefit Plan satisfied prior to the
Closing in the same plan year as the Closing for purposes of any annual and
lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single continuous employer.

(f) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, have in effect as of the
Closing flexible spending reimbursement accounts for medical and dependent
care expenses under a cafeteria plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code
(the " _Buyer_ __ _s Cafeteria Plan_ ") that provide benefits to Continuing
Employees no less favorable than the benefits provided to Buyers other
employees. Buyer agrees to cause the Buyers Cafeteria Plan to accept a spin-
off of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts of the Continuing
Employees from the cafeteria plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code
maintained by Seller Parent in which such employees participated immediately
prior to the Closing (" _Seller Parent_ __ _s Cafeteria Plan_ ") and to honor
and continue through the end of the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs the elections made by each Continuing Employee under the Seller
Parents Cafeteria Plan in respect of the flexible spending accounts that are
in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer shall credit or debit, as
applicable, effective as of the Closing Date, the applicable account of each
Continuing Employee under Buyers Cafeteria Plan with an amount equal to the
balance of such Continuing Employees account under Seller Parents Cafeteria
Plan as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall cause to be transferred from
the Seller Parents Cafeteria Plan to the Buyers Cafeteria Plan the excess,
if any, of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible spending
reimbursement accounts made prior to the Closing during the year in which the
Closing Date occurs by Continuing Employees over the aggregate reimbursement
payouts made prior to the Closing for such year from such accounts to
the Continuing Employees. If the aggregate reimbursement payouts from the
flexible spending reimbursement accounts made prior to the Closing during the
year in which the Closing Date occurs made to Continuing Employees exceed the
aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts prior to the Closing for
such year by the Continuing Employees, Buyer shall cause such excess to be
transferred to Seller Parent as soon as practicable following the Closing
Date. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall assume and be solely
responsible for all claims by Continuing Employees under the Seller Parents
Cafeteria Plan whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that
have not been paid in full as of the Closing.

 

(g) Buyer shall cause each Continuing Employee who is a participant in a
Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that
includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of
Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Seller_ _401(k)_ _Plans_ ") to be allowed
to participate, effective as of the date of his or her commencement of
employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates, in a tax qualified plan which
includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of
Section 401(k) of the Code that is sponsored and maintained by Buyer or an
Affiliate thereof (the " _Buyer_ _401(k)_ _Plan_ ") and such Continuing
Employee shall be credited with eligibility service and vesting service for
all periods of service with Seller Parent or its Affiliates to the extent so
credited with such service under the applicable Seller 401(k) Plan. In
addition, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer
401(k) Plan to accept rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
inclusive of loans) from the Seller 401(k) Plan, including any participant
loans.

joint venture agreement, limited liability company agreement, or any
other agreement to which either it or they or any such other Person, on the
one hand, and any Company Entity, on the other hand, is a party shall be
deemed to apply to, or restrict, in any way, the execution, delivery and
performance of the Transaction Documents or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby and (c) agrees that the execution, delivery
and performance of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby shall be permitted without any Company

cause the replacement of any such Contract by a Contract having effect
beginning not earlier than the Closing Date and otherwise having
substantially the same terms, which shall be deemed to be reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and Seller; and _provided further_ , that any
indemnities with respect to activities or events occurring prior to the
Closing that (a) by the terms of the applicable Contract, survive the
termination of such Contract and (b) are in favor of Seller and its Affiliates
or are in favor of any Company Entity, shall not be terminated.

 

Section 6.15 _Post-Closing Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. From and after
the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any
actions that would restrict or prevent its or their ability to perform its or
their post-Closing covenants and agreements hereunder, including any action
that would make its or their "commercially reasonable efforts" materially
less likely to produce the intended result for Seller. Further, as part of

Section 6.18 _Cooperation with Financing_. (a) In connection with any offering
of equity or debt securities, bank borrowing (or syndication thereof) or any
other financing by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, the proceeds of which are
to be used to finance payment of all or any portion of the Purchase Price (or
refinance any interim financing used for such purpose) (the " _Buyer

consolidated financial statements (without footnotes) for the Company Entities
taken as a whole for the year ended December 31, 2017 and for each fiscal
quarter that has ended at least forty (40) days prior to the Closing Date).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, such cooperation
shall not include and shall not require Seller or any of its Affiliates
to (i) prepare or provide audited financial statements for Seller or any of
its Affiliates, or for any of the Company Entities, (ii) obtain consents from
the auditors of Seller or any of its Affiliates to include any audited
financial information in any offering memorandum or other document or

privilege.

obtained by Buyer or its Representatives shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that such
information may be disclosed to lenders in connection with such financing on
a confidential, need to know basis and in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and
agreed that Seller shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ unless the Buyer Financing has not been obtained as

under this section. In no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates have
any obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ following the Closing.

the extent they arise out of any gross negligence or willful misconduct of any
of Seller or its Affiliates or their respective directors, officers,

including the obligation of Buyer to proceed with the Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, if such financing has not been obtained, Buyer shall
continue to be obligated, until such time as the Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms and subject to the waiver or fulfillment of the

the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with the
payment of any such Damages (such amounts and benefits are collectively
referred to herein as " _Indemnity Reduction Amounts_ "). If any Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates receives any Indemnity Reduction Amounts in respect
of a claim for which indemnification is provided under this Agreement after
the full amount of such claim has been paid by an Indemnifying Party or after
an Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment of such claim and such
Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid balance of such claim,
then the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party an
amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount theretofore paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim, less (ii) the amount of the
indemnity payment that would have been due if such Indemnity Reduction Amounts
in respect thereof had been received before the indemnity payment was made.
An insurer or other third party who would otherwise be obligated to pay any
claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or,
solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any
subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and
agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to any
benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the
indemnification provisions by virtue of the indemnification provisions
hereof. Each of Seller and Buyer, as appropriate, shall, or shall cause each
Indemnified Party to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
promptly any claims or rights it may have against all third parties
which would reduce the amount of Damages for which indemnification is
provided under this Agreement and take all commercially reasonable actions to
mitigate damages. Tax benefits under this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(f)_ shall mean
any reduction in actual cash Taxes payable by Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Company Entities after the Closing) attributable to any tax
deduction or loss claimed by Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to the event
or circumstances giving rise to the Damages for which the indemnification was
made, determined on a with or without basis.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall include the obligation to pay Damages relating to
breaches which do not arise out of, or involve, any Third-Party Claims.

 

Section 8.3 _Method of Asserting Claims_. All claims for indemnification by
any Indemnified Party under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party
might seek indemnity under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ is asserted against or sought
to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than a Party or
any of its Affiliates (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), then such Indemnified
Party shall deliver a Claim Notice promptly to the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with paragraph (b) below. In case any such action is brought
against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate in and to assume and control the

 



56

    

 defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Party, and after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party
of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof;
_provided_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at
the Indemnified Partys expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, it shall not be obligated to pay
the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for the Indemnified
Parties with respect to such Third Party Claim, unless the Indemnified
Parties shall have been advised by counsel that representation of any such
Indemnified Parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct due to actual or potential
differing interests between them, in which case such Indemnified Parties shall
have the right to select separate counsel the fees and expenses of which shall
be paid by the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnifying Party shall consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim of
which it has assumed the defense hereunder without the consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that such consent shall not be required
if (i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional general
release by the third party asserting the claim to all Indemnified Parties
affected by the claim and (ii) the settlement is for money damages only. No
Indemnifying Party shall be subject to any Liability for any settlement of a
Third Party Claim made without its consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

(b) In the event of any claim or demand, including Third Party Claims, in
respect of which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice promptly to the
Indemnifying Party, _provided_ , that the failure by any Indemnified Party to
give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such partys rights hereunder
except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced thereby,
and then only to the extent of such prejudice. The Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnified Party within the thirty (30)-day period after its
receipt of such Indemnity Notice (the " _Dispute Period_ ") as to whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its Liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder.

 

(c) The Parties shall cooperate with one another with respect to resolving any
claim or Liability with respect to which one Party is obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, any amounts payable
pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be
paid without duplication, including with respect to duplication of any
Liability that is included in the Final Adjustment Certificate or with respect
to the amount of any Liability for which there is an accrual on the Interim
Balance Sheets.

(b) Except for the express obligations of Seller under this Agreement, for and
in consideration of the Company Interests, effective as of the Closing,
Buyer, on behalf of itself and its direct and indirect equityholders,
Subsidiaries, Affiliates and direct and indirect parent companies, and the
Representatives and direct and indirect equityholders of any of the following
and each of their respective successors and assigns (each a " _Releasor_ "),
hereby absolutely and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever
discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Seller and its past,
present and future equityholders, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and each of the
present and former Representatives, equityholders and control persons of any
of the foregoing, and

 



58

    

 each of the respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns of any of the foregoing (each, a " _Releasee_ ") of, from and against
any and all Actions, causes of action, claims, demands, Damages, judgments,
Liabilities, debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and description
whatsoever, whether known or unknown, both in Law and in equity, in each case
to the extent arising out of or resulting from Sellers or such Releasees

operations, conduct, services, products or employees (including former
employees) of any of the Company Entities (or its predecessors),
whether related to any period of time before or after the Closing, including
any Liabilities under Environmental Law. Each Releasor agrees not to, and
agrees to cause its respective equityholders, Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
Representatives direct and indirect parent companies and each of their
respective successors and assigns, not to, assert any claim against the
Releasees; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Releasor releases its rights and interests under this Agreement.

(c) None of the Seller Indemnified Parties and none of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to any recovery under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document following Closing for any of its or its Affiliates
special, exemplary, punitive, consequential, incidental or indirect damages,
lost profits (including any damages on account of lost opportunities or lost
or delayed power generation) or losses based on diminution of value or
calculated by reference to any multiple of earnings or earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation or amortization (or any other valuation
methodology);  _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to third-party
claims for which any Party is obligated to indemnify another Party hereunder.

 

(d) From and after the Closing, except to the extent provided under this
_Article VIII_ , all rights or remedies that Buyer may have against any
Seller Indemnified Party (i) with respect to adverse matters, including
contingent liabilities, defects (legal or otherwise) and adverse physical or
environmental conditions, that may not have been revealed by
Buyers investigations of the Real Property in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) at or under Environmental
Laws or with respect to any liabilities under Environmental Laws or any other
environmental matters relating to the Company Entities are waived. From and
after the Closing, except as provided in this Agreement, Buyer does hereby
agree, warrant and covenant to (and shall cause the Company Entities to)
release, acquit, forever discharge and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified
Parties from any and all Damages, including all claims, demands and causes of
action for contribution and indemnity under statute or common law, that Buyer
may have asserted or alleged or are or could be asserted or alleged now or in
the future against any Seller Indemnified Party in regard to the Real Property
by reason of or arising out of the physical or environmental condition
thereof, violations of applicable laws and any and all other acts,
omissions, events, circumstances or matters relating to the foregoing or that
relate to or in any way arise pursuant to Environmental Laws or out of
liabilities under Environmental Laws or any other environmental matters of the
Company Entities.

 

(e) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives, successors and
assigns, hereby forever releases, acquits and discharges, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company Entities and their past or
present Representatives, from and against any and all Liabilities which Seller
and any such Affiliate, Representative, successor or assign ever had, now has
or may have, known or unknown, by reason of any fact, event, occurrence,
matter, cause or thing whatsoever arising on or prior to the Closing Date.
Effective as of the Closing, Seller, for itself and on behalf of its and

 



59

    

 their Affiliates and their respective Representatives, successors and
assigns agrees not to assert any claim, and to cause each of its Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives, successors and assigns not to
assert any claim, against any Company Entity or any of its past or present
Representatives in respect thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller does
not release its rights and interests under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

Section 8.5 _Exclusive Remedies_. From and after Closing, except in the case
of actual, intentional fraud (provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt,
this exception shall not be deemed to expand the representations and
warranties expressly set forth herein), the remedies set forth in _Section_ __
_ 2.4_ and this  _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims relating, directly or indirectly, to the subject
matter of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject to  _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, this _Article VIII_ and _Article IX_ ,
Buyer and Seller hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or any of

arising under or based upon any Law.

 

Section 8.6 _Tax Characterization_. The Parties agree to treat any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law.

(b) by either Seller or Buyer by giving written notice to the other Party if
the Closing shall not have occurred by the date that is one hundred eighty
(180) days after the date of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "),
unless extended by written agreement of Seller and Buyer; _provided_ ,
_however_ that if the only conditions that have not been satisfied or waived
as of the Termination Date are the obtaining of any Consents from any
Governmental Authority (including, solely for the purposes of this _Section_
__ _ 9.1(b)_, Consents from the U.S. Department of Energy) required under
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_, the Termination Date shall be automatically extended for
an additional sixty (60) days; _provided further_ that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this subsection (b) shall not be available to any Party
whose breach of its obligations under this Agreement has been a cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated by such time;

 

(c) by either Seller or Buyer by giving written notice to the other Party if
such other Party has breached its covenants, agreements or other obligations
hereunder in a manner that would reasonably be expected to cause any condition
of such Party giving notice set forth in _Article VII_ not to be satisfied
and, except in the case of a breach of Buyers obligation to effect
the Closing and pay the Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of
_Article II_ , such breach either is not capable of being cured or has not
been cured within the earlier of thirty (30) days after written notification
thereof and the Termination Date by the Party seeking termination hereunder;

 



60

    

(d) by either Seller or Buyer by giving written notice to the other Party if
any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall not be
subject to appeal or shall have become final and unappealable; _provided_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this subsection (d) shall not
be available to any Party whose breach of its obligations under this
Agreement has been a cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated by such time; or

 

(e) by Seller if (i) all the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and have been satisfied (and continue to be satisfied)
or irrevocably waived (other than any such conditions which by their terms are
not capable of being satisfied until the Closing Date) and (ii) the Buyer does
not consummate the transactions contemplated hereby within three (3) Business
Days of the day the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.5_.

 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, all rights and obligations of
the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any Liability on the part of
either Party or its Affiliates in respect thereof, except that (i) provisions
of, and the obligations of Buyer and Seller under, _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_,
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ this _Article IX_ and _Article X_ of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and (ii) such termination shall not relieve
any Party of any Liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination.

ARTICLE X.

Section 10.4 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified except in a written instrument executed by
each of the Parties. No waiver by any of the Parties of any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such
occurrence. No waiver by any of the Parties of any of the provisions hereof
shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed by the

Section 10.5 _Exhibits and Schedule_ _s_.

(a) All Exhibits and Schedules and the Disclosure Schedules attached hereto
are hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.

(b) Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to deliver to Buyer,
at any time prior to the Closing Date, a supplement to the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Closing Date Schedule Supplement_ ") to disclose any matter
that, if existing at or arising prior to the date hereof, would have been
required to be set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule for the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth herein to be true and
correct as of the date hereof; provided, however, that any such supplement
shall be of no force or effect with respect to  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_. Seller shall not be liable to Buyer, and Buyer shall
not be entitled to claim that any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement has been breached, on account of any fact, matter
or circumstance of which Buyer becomes aware between the date hereof and the
Closing Date through a Closing Date Schedule Supplement or written notice
delivered to Buyer in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, but only if
such fact, matter or circumstance would have relieved Buyer from its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby at the Closing
Date and Buyer nevertheless elected to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby upon Closing.

Section 10.6 _Headings_. The table of contents and section headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not be deemed a

of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



63

    

Section 10.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
the Exhibits hereto), the other Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any prior understandings,
negotiations, agreements, or representations among the Parties of any nature,
whether written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject
matter hereof or thereof.

 

Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void
or unenforceable in any respect, all other provisions of this Agreement, or
the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other
than those as to which it has been held invalid, illegal, void or
unenforceable, shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and shall in
no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby. Upon such determination
that any provision, or the application of any such provision, is invalid,
illegal, void or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the greatest extent possible. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein, under no circumstance shall the obligation of Seller to deliver the
Company Interests be enforceable absent enforceability of the obligation of
Buyer to pay the Purchase Price, and vice versa.

 

Section 10.10 _Expenses_.

 

(a) Buyer and Seller shall share equally in the obligation to pay (i) any and
all costs of any audit of any Company Entity as may be required to enable
Buyer to complete and file any filing by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer with
any Governmental Authority or otherwise required in order to cause any of the
conditions specified in _Article VII_ to be fully satisfied. and (ii) any and
filing fees and expenses with respect to any filings required under the HSR
Act in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule with
respect to the obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, any fees, costs or expenses
paid or payable to third parties (excluding any Affiliate or Subsidiary of a
Party) incurred in connection with obtaining any Consent required in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
except for fees and disbursements of Representatives employed by the
respective Parties shall be shared equally between Buyer and Seller. 

(c) Unless otherwise provided herein, including as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.2_, each of Buyer and Seller agrees to pay, without right of reimbursement
from the other, all costs and expenses incurred by it incident to the
performance of its obligations hereunder, including the fees and disbursements
of counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts and consultants employed
by the respective Parties in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated.

 



64

    

Section 10.11 _No Recourse Against  Non-Recourse Persons_. Other than
pursuant to and to the extent provided in the Transaction Documents, all
claims, obligations, Liabilities, or causes of action (whether in contract or
in tort, in equity or at Law, or granted by statute) that may be based upon,
in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate
in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance
of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only
against (and are those solely of) the entities that are expressly identified
as parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the " _Contracting Parties_ ").
Other than pursuant to and to the extent provided in the Transaction
Documents, no Person who is not a Contracting Party, including any past,
present or future Representative, incorporator, equityholder or Affiliate of
such Contracting Party or any past, present or future Representative,
incorporator, equityholder or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (the " _Non-
Recourse Persons_"), shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in
tort, in equity or at Law, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of
action, obligations, or Liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with,
or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or in its negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such Liabilities, claims,
causes of action and obligations against any such Non-Recourse Persons.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law, other than pursuant to and to the
extent provided in the Transaction Documents, (a) each Contracting Party
hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of
action that may otherwise be available in equity or at Law, or granted by
statute, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or
otherwise impose Liability of a Contracting Party on any Non-Recourse Persons,
whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency,
control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business
enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise;
and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon any Non-Recourse
Persons with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any entity
providing or agreeing to provide any debt financing to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, the proceeds of which are used for the payment of all or a portion
of the Purchase Price, nor any of their respective Affiliates or their and
their respective Affiliates former, current and future officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives and their respective successors and
assigns, in such capacity have any liability to the Seller, any former,
current or future stockholders, equity holders, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, general or limited partners, members,
managers, agents or Affiliates of the Seller, or any former, current or future
direct or indirect stockholder, equity holder, controlling person, director,
officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, agent or
Affiliate of any of the foregoing other than Buyer and its Affiliates (each, a
"Related Party"), relating to or arising out of this Agreement, whether at
law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Seller nor
any Related Party will have any rights or claims against any of such entity or
Person hereunder.

 

Section 10.12 _Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) each Party recognizes and acknowledges that a
breach by it of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement shall
cause the other Party to sustain irreparable harm for which it would not have
an adequate remedy at Law, and therefore in the event of any such breach the
aggrieved Party shall, without the posting of bond or other security (any
requirement for which the Parties hereby waive), be entitled to the remedy of
specific performance of such covenants and agreements, including injunctive
and other equitable relief, in addition to any other remedy to which it might
be entitled, (ii) a Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement, and (iii) in the event that any action is
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall
allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there
is an adequate remedy at law.

 



65

    

Section 10.13 _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Company Entities and
Seller have retained Latham and Watkins LLP and the legal departments of Seller
and its Affiliates (collectively, " _Seller_ __ _s Counsel_ ") to act as
their counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that
Sellers Counsel has not acted as counsel for any other Party in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and that none of the other Parties
has the status of a client of any of Sellers Counsel for conflict of interest
or any other purposes as a result thereof. Seller and Buyer hereby agree
that, in the event that any dispute, or any other matter in which the
interests of Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company Entities), on the other hand, are adverse,
arises after the Closing between Buyer or the Company Entities, on the one
hand, and Seller and its Affiliates, on the other hand, Sellers Counsel may
represent any or all of Seller and its Affiliates in such dispute even though
the interests of Seller and its Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer
or the Company Entities, and even though Sellers Counsel formerly may have
represented the Company Entities in any matter substantially related to such
dispute.

 

(b) Seller and its Affiliates and Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Company Entities following the Closing with respect to Buyer), acknowledge
and agree that, in connection with any future disputes, lawsuits, actions,
proceedings, investigations or other matters, including any dispute between
Buyer, the Company Entities or any of its or their respective Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, or with
or between any other Persons, with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (i) as to all communications among Sellers Counsel, the
Company Entities, Seller or any of its Affiliates, the attorney-client
privilege, attorney work product protection and the expectation of client
confidence belongs solely to Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company
Entities), and may be controlled by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the
Company Entities), and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the Company
Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates and (ii) Sellers Counsel may
disclose to Seller or its Affiliates any information learned by Sellers
Counsel in the course of its representation of Seller, the Company Entities or
their respective Affiliates, whether or not such information is subject to
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, of Sellers
Counsels duty of confidentiality. Accordingly, Buyer and its Affiliates shall
not have access to any such communications, or to the files of Sellers
Counsel, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (A) to the extent that files of
Sellers Counsel constitute property of the client, only Seller and its
Affiliates shall hold such property rights and (B) Sellers Counsel shall
have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to Buyer or the Company Entities by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Sellers Counsel and the Company
Entities or otherwise.

(c) If and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing, Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) shall have the right to
assert or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between the Company Entities or its Affiliates and any Person
representing them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including the Company Entities), shall be
entitled to waive such privilege only with the consent of Seller.

Section 10.14 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be governed by the Laws of the State of New York.

 

Section 10.15 _Binding Arbitration_.

 

(a) Except with respect to actions with respect to remedies described in
_Section_ __ _ 10.12_, which may be brought and decided in a court of
competent jurisdiction and as provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.15(f)_, each of
the Parties irrevocably agrees that all Disputes shall be finally settled by
binding arbitration, pursuant to comprehensive arbitration rules of JAMS, by
(subject to the first clause of _Section_ __ _ 10.15(b)_) three (3)
arbitrators who are to be appointed in accordance with the said rules and who,
to the extent possible, shall have experience and expertise in the subject
matter involved in the Dispute.

(b) Unless the Parties can agree in writing on a single arbitrator within
fifteen (15) days after the delivery of notice referred to in _Section_ __ _
10.15(a)_, then, within fifteen (15) days thereafter, Seller, on the one hand
(which shall be entitled to specify one arbitrator), and Buyer, on the other
hand (which shall be entitled to specify one arbitrator), shall each notify
the other in writing of the name of the independent arbitrator chosen by them
to participate as a member of a three-member panel of arbitrators. If either
Party fails to give the other timely notice of such appointment, then the
Party who timely gave such notice shall be entitled to require that its
arbitrator act as the sole arbitrator hereunder. If an arbitrator is timely
appointed by each of the Parties, the two named arbitrators shall select the
third member of the arbitration panel within fifteen (15) days after they have
both been appointed, and they shall promptly notify the Parties thereof. If
the two initially appointed arbitrators cannot timely agree on a third
arbitrator, then any Party may request that JAMS select the third arbitrator.
Each arbitrator shall be neutral. The arbitrators, to the extent possible,
shall have experience and expertise in the subject matter involved in the
Dispute and in the solar and wind power industry.

(c) The arbitration hearing shall be held at a site in San Diego, California.
The arbitration proceedings shall be held in the English language.

(d) The arbitration hearing shall be concluded within one hundred
twenty (120) days after the hearing is commenced unless otherwise ordered by
a majority of the arbitrators on compelling grounds, and the award thereon or
decision with respect thereto shall be made within thirty (30) days after the
close of the submission of evidence; _provided_ , that failure by the
arbitrators to conclude the arbitration hearing or make such award or decision
within the foregoing deadlines shall not invalidate such arbitration hearing,
award or decision. Arbitration demanded hereunder by any Party shall be final
and binding on the Parties and may not be vacated except for the reasons set
forth in applicable Law. The decision, arbitration order and relief agreed
upon in writing by any two or more of the arbitrators (in the case of a
three-member panel) shall be deemed the decision of the panel for all purposes
hereof. If two or more members of the arbitration panel cannot agree, then the
decision of the arbitrator not appointed by any Party shall control. The
references herein to the arbitration panel shall also be deemed to refer to a
single arbitrator where a panel is not being used hereunder, and all
references to decisions, orders, awards and relief granted by the panel of
arbitrators shall mean the decision, order, award or relief agreed upon in
writing by the required number of members of the panel, as indicated.

 



67

    

(e) The Parties agree that the arbitration panel may render and the Parties
shall abide by any interim ruling that the arbitration panel deems necessary
or prudent regarding discovery, summary proceedings, or other pre-arbitration
matters.

 

(f) The Parties hereby submit to the _in personam_ jurisdiction of the
California state courts located in San Diego and the federal courts located
in the Southern District of California, and agree that any such court may
enter all such orders in support of the procedures set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 10.15_, and such courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect
to any order in support of such procedures. For any action with respect to
_Section_ __ _ 10.12_, the Parties hereby submit to the _in personam_
jurisdiction of (i) the California state courts located in San Diego and the
federal courts located in the Southern District of California and (ii) the New
York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan (New York County) and
the federal courts located in the Southern District of New York, and such
courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to any remedy sought
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.12_. Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Action,
suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in such courts, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such Action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Any court of law shall enforce the
decision of the panel of arbitrators (or single arbitrator, as applicable) in
its entirety and only in its entirety, including pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.12_.

(g) Each Party shall bear its own costs, expenses and attorneys fees
associated with the Dispute resolution process, and the arbitrators shall not
have authority to allocate the costs or expenses of the arbitration. The
arbitrators shall not have the authority to award punitive damages against any
Party.

 

(h) Third parties dealing with any Party shall be entitled to fully rely on
any written arbitration order or decision with regard to the matters
addressed therein, whether or not such arbitration order or decision has been
confirmed or adopted by a court, or incorporated in any order of any court.

 

Section 10.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
