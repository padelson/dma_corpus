direct control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls.
The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1)&nbsp;transactions are executed only in accordance with management&rsquo;s
authorization; (2)&nbsp;transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; (3)&nbsp;access
to such assets is permitted only in accordance with management&rsquo;s authorization; (4)&nbsp;the reporting of such assets is
compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5)&nbsp;accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded
accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis.
The Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Company&rsquo;s auditors
and the audit committee of the Company Board (i)&nbsp;all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company&rsquo;s internal controls, and the Company has made available to Parent copies
of any material written materials relating to the foregoing. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
is made known to the Company&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge
of the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Company&rsquo;s principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to material information required to be included in the Company&rsquo;s periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer of the Company (as defined in Rule&nbsp;3b-7 promulgated under the

the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent required to be included in reports filed under
the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to Parent&rsquo;s principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of Parent, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective

none of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer of

Termination Payee received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination Payee of the Expense Amount would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code or (B)&nbsp;the Termination Payee&rsquo;s outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt
by the Termination Payee of the Expense Amount should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income

the Expense Amount to the Termination Payee. The Termination Payor agrees to amend this <U>Section 8.3(d)</U> at the reasonable

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the General Partner is hereby authorized to cause the Partnership to issue such
additional Partnership Interests, in the form of Partnership Units, for any Partnership purpose at any time or from time to time
to the Partners (including the General Partner and/or the Limited Partner) or to other Persons, and admit such Persons as additional
general partners of the Partnership pursuant to Section 7.03 or additional Limited Partners pursuant to this Section 4.02, for
such consideration, or in connection with the performance of past, present or future services to the Partnership, and on such terms
and conditions as shall be established by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion, all without the approval of
any Limited Partners or any other Person. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, a Person shall be deemed admitted to
the Partnership as an additional Limited Partner upon the written consent of the General Partner and the execution of a counterpart
to this Agreement by such Person. The General Partner&rsquo;s determination that consideration is adequate shall be conclusive
insofar as the adequacy of consideration relates to whether the Partnership Units are validly issued and fully paid. Notwithstanding

must furnish the General Partner with a FIRPTA Certificate in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;C-1 or Exhibit
C-2 and any other documentation reasonably requested by the General Partner. If the Partnership or the General Partner is required
to withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any amount upon a Redeeming Limited Partner&rsquo;s exercise of the OP Unit Redemption
Right and if the OP Unit Redemption Amount equals or exceeds the Withheld Amount, the Withheld Amount shall be treated as an amount
received by such Partner in redemption of its OP Units. If, however, the OP Unit Redemption Amount is less than the Withheld Amount,
the Redeeming Limited Partner shall not receive any portion of the OP Unit Redemption Amount, the OP Unit Redemption Amount shall
be treated as an amount received by such Partner in redemption of its OP Units, and the Partner shall contribute the excess of
the Withheld Amount over the OP Unit Redemption Amount to the Partnership before the Partnership is required to pay over such excess
to a taxing authority.</P>

the outstanding OP Units into a smaller number of units, or (C) the Partnership issues any Partnership Units in exchange for its
outstanding OP Units by way of a reclassification or recapitalization of its OP Units. If more than one Adjustment Event occurs,

Event as if all Adjustment Events occurred simultaneously. For the avoidance of doubt, the following events shall not be Adjustment
Events: (x) the issuance of Partnership Units in a financing, reorganization, acquisition or other similar business transaction,
(y) the issuance of Partnership Units pursuant to any employee benefit or compensation plan or distribution reinvestment plan,
or (z) the issuance of any Partnership Units in respect of a capital contribution to the Partnership, including a contribution
by the General Partner of proceeds from the sale of securities by the General Partner. If the Partnership takes an action affecting
the OP Units other than actions specifically described above as Adjustment Events and, in the opinion of the General Partner such

Partner shall have the right to make such adjustment to the Class B Units, to the extent permitted by law, in such manner and at
such time as the General Partner, in its sole discretion, may determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. If an adjustment
is made to the Class B Units as herein provided, the Partnership shall promptly file in the books and records of the Partnership
an officer&rsquo;s certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment, which
certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment absent manifest error. Promptly after the filing
of such certificate, the Partnership shall mail a notice to each holder of Class B Units setting forth the adjustment to his, her
or its Class B Units and the effective date of such adjustment.</P>

of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to the Company shareholders in exchange for their shares of Company
Common Stock. The fractional share interests of each Company shareholder will be aggregated, and no Company shareholder, with the
possible exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts, held under separate names, held jointly or held with
multiple brokers, will receive cash with respect to fractional shares in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full

best judgment as to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a
guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0in">In rendering our opinion, we have considered
and relied upon the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder (&ldquo;<U>Regulations</U>&rdquo;), administrative rulings and
other Treasury interpretations of the Code and Regulations by the courts and the IRS, all as they exist at the date hereof. It
should be noted that the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any
time and, in some circumstances, with retroactive effect. A change that is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing could
adversely affect our conclusions set forth herein. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsel&rsquo;s
best judgment as to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a
guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a position
if asserted by the IRS.</P>
