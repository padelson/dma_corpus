THE MERGERS

  



  

Section 2.1 _The Mergers_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
and in accordance with the MGCL and the DLLCA, at the Effective Time, the
Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, whereupon the separate
existence of the Company shall cease, and Merger Sub shall continue under the
name "Tiger Acquisition, LLC" as the surviving entity in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Entity_ ") and shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the MGCL, the DLLCA
and this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall
possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub, and all of the claims, obligations,
liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Surviving Entity.

  



  

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DRULPA, at the Partnership Merger Effective Time,
the Company Operating Partnership shall be merged with and into the Parent
Operating Partnership, whereupon the separate existence of the Company
Operating Partnership shall cease, and the Parent Operating Partnership shall
continue under the name "ARC Properties Operating Partnership, L.P." as the
surviving entity in the Partnership Merger (the " _Surviving Partnership_ ")
and shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. The Partnership
Merger shall have the effects specified in the DRULPA and this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from
and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Partnership
shall possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company Operating Partnership, and all of the claims, obligations,
liabilities, debts and duties of the Company Operating Partnership shall
become the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the
Surviving Partnership (including the obligations of the Company Operating
Partnership under the Company Partnership Agreement).

  



  

Section 2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Mergers (the " _Closing_
") shall occur at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern time), on the third (3rd) Business Day
after all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those
conditions that by their terms are required to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) shall
have been satisfied or waived by the party entitled to the benefit of the
same or at such other time and date as shall be agreed upon by the parties
hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the " _Closing Date_ ". The Closing shall take place at the offices of
Duane Morris LLP, 30 South 17th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19103, or
at such other place as agreed to by the parties hereto.

  



   

15 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Section 2.3 _Effective Time_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall prepare and, on the Closing
Date, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) cause articles of merger
with respect to the Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be duly executed
and filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland
(the " _SDAT_ ") as provided under the MGCL, (ii) cause a certificate of
merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be
duly executed and filed with the Delaware Secretary as provided under the
DLLCA and (iii) make any other filings, recordings or publications required to
be made by the Company or Merger Sub under the MGCL or DLLCA in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT and the Certificate of
Merger shall have been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary on the Closing
Date or on such other date and time (not to exceed thirty (30) days from the
date the Articles of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT and the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary) as shall be
agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in the Articles of Merger
and Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective
being the " _Effective Time_ ") it being understood and agreed that the
parties shall cause the Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall prepare and, on the Closing
Date, the Company Operating Partnership and the Parent Operating Partnership
shall (i) cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Partnership
Merger (the " _Partnership Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed and
filed with the Delaware Secretary as provided under the DRULPA and (ii) make
any other filings, recordings or publications required to be made by the
Company Operating Partnership or the Parent Operating Partnership under the
DRULPA in connection with the Partnership Merger. The Partnership Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Partnership Certificate of Merger
shall have been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary on the Closing Date or
on such other date and time (not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date the
Partnership Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary)
as shall be agreed to by the Company Operating Partnership and the Parent
Operating Partnership and specified in the Partnership Certificate of Merger
(such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the " _Partnership
Merger Effective Time_ "), it being understood and agreed that the parties
shall cause the Partnership Merger Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date
after the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) If the consummation of the Merger prior to the consummation of
the Partnership Merger (and, therefore, the Effective Time occurring prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time), as is contemplated by this Agreement,
would cause any of the parties to incur a materially greater amount of
Transfer Taxes than would be incurred if the Merger were consummated
following the consummation of the Partnership Merger (and, therefore, if the
Effective Time were to occur following the Partnership Merger Effective Time),
then, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and with
the written consent of Parent and the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the timing of the
consummation of the Merger and Partnership Merger shall be re-ordered so that
the Merger shall occur and be consummated following the consummation of the
Partnership Merger (and, therefore, the Effective Time will occur
following the Partnership Merger Effective Time).

Section 2.4 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity and
the Surviving Partnership_. Subject to _Section 6.10_ , at the Effective
Time, the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law
and the applicable provisions of such certificate of formation and limited
liability company agreement. At the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the
Parent Partnership Agreement will be amended and restated substantially in
the form set forth on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto, and the certificate of
limited partnership of the Parent Operating Partnership as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Parent Partnership Agreement,
as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of limited partnership
and partnership agreement of the Surviving Partnership, until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of
such certificate of limited partnership and partnership agreement.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be,
and is hereby adopted as, a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections
354 and 361 of the Code. It is further intended for U.S. federal income tax
purposes that the Partnership Merger shall qualify as and constitute an
"asset-over" form of merger under Treasury Regulations Section
1.708-1(c)(3)(i) with the Surviving Partnership as the continuation of the
Company Operating Partnership and the termination of the Parent Operating
Partnership.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Subsequent Actions_.

  



  

(a) If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Entity
shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, that any actions are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Entity its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights or properties of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the members, officers and managers
of the Surviving Entity shall be authorized to take all such actions as may
be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest in, to or under
such rights or properties in the Surviving Entity or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

  



  

(b) If at any time after the Partnership Merger Effective Time the
Surviving Partnership shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion,
that any actions are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Partnership its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights or properties of the Company Operating
Partnership acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Partnership as a
result of, or in connection with, the Partnership Merger or otherwise to carry
out this Agreement, then the general partner(s) of the Surviving Partnership
shall be authorized to take all such actions as may be necessary or desirable
to vest all right, title or interest in, to or under such rights or
properties in the Surviving Partnership or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement.

subject to _Section 6.1(c)(ii)_ and _Section 6.1(c)(iii)_ , if at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the Company or the Company Operating Partnership should split, combine or
otherwise reclassify the Company Common Stock, the Company GP Units or
Company OP Units, or make a dividend or other distribution in shares of
Company Common Stock, Company GP Units or Company OP Units (including any

reorganization, recapitalization or exchange or other like change, then
(without limiting any other rights of the Parent Parties hereunder), the

Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and subject to

period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Parent or
the Parent Operating Partnership should split, combine or otherwise
reclassify the Parent Common Stock or Parent OP Units, or make a distribution
in shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent OP Units (including any dividend
or other distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or
Parent OP Units), or engage in a reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or exchange or other like change, then the Merger
Consideration or Partnership Merger Consideration, as applicable, shall be

Section 3.2 _Proration_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement,
the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company
Restricted Stock and shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of
Company Options pursuant to _Section 3.10(a)_ ) that may be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_
(the " _Cash Conversion Number_ ") shall be equal to the product (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) of thirty percent (30%) times the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. All other shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Company
Restricted Stock and shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of a
Company Option pursuant to _Section 3.10(a)_ , but other than shares of
Company Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in _Section 3.1(a)_ ) shall
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

  



  

(b) Within two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among former
holders of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock and
shares of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of Company Options
pursuant to _Section 3.10(a)_ ) of rights to receive the Cash Consideration
and the Stock Consideration as follows:

  



  

(i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
(including Company Restricted Stock and shares of Company Common issued upon
exercise of Company Options pursuant to _Section 3.10(a)_ ) with respect to
which Cash Elections shall have been made (the " _Cash Election Number_ ")
exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then all Stock Election Shares and all
Non-Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration, and Cash Election Shares held by such holder of each holder
thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in
respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (A) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by
(B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion Number and the
denominator of which is the Cash Election Number (with the Exchange Agent to
determine, consistent with _Section 3.2(a)_ , whether fractions of Cash
Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number
of such holder's Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration; and

  



   

20 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) If the Cash Election Number is less than or equal to the Cash
Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Electing Shares and Stock
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of
shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock and shares
of Company Common Stock issued upon exercise of Company Options pursuant to
_Section 3.10(a)_ ) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a " _Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article III_ , to submit an election on or prior to
the Election Deadline in accordance with the following procedures:

  



  

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 3.3_ (herein called an " _Election_ ") (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to
which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Cash Election.

  



  

(b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Form of Election_ "), which shall be mailed by the Company to record
holders of Company Common Stock so as to permit those holders to exercise
their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.

  



  

(c) The Company shall mail or cause to be mailed the Form of
Election to record holders of Common Stock as of the record date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to
the anticipated Election Deadline and shall use reasonable best efforts to
make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to all persons who
become holders of shares of Common Stock during the period following the
record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting and prior to the Election
Deadline.

  



  

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the person
authorized to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent under this
Agreement, which person shall be a bank or trust company selected by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") entered into
prior to the mailing of the Form of Election to Company stockholders, shall
have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed
and signed and accompanied by Certificates representing the shares of Company
Common Stock to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in
blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the
Company or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such
Certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a firm that is an
"eligible guarantor institution" (as defined in Rule 17Ad-15 under the
Exchange Act); _provided_ , that such Certificates are in fact delivered to
the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery, and,
in the case of Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents specified in the
procedures set forth in the Form of Election. Failure to deliver shares of
Company Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time
set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise
properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in its sole
and absolute discretion. As used herein, unless otherwise agreed in advance by
the Company and Parent, " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. local time
(in the city in which the principal office of the Exchange Agent is located)
on the later of (i) the date immediately prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting and (ii) the date that Parent and the Company shall agree is five (5)
Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date. The Company and
Parent shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to
each of them announcing the anticipated date of the Election Deadline not
more than fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at least five (5) Business
Days prior to, the Election Deadline. If the Closing is delayed to a
subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate to promptly publicly announce such
rescheduled Election Deadline and Closing.

  



   

21

--- 

    



  

(e) Any Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline,
change or revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly
completed and signed revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the
Election Deadline of his or her Certificates, or of the guarantee of delivery
of such Certificates, or any documents in respect of Book-Entry
Shares, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be
automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written
notification from Parent or the Company that this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_. Subject to the terms of the
Exchange Agent Agreement, if Parent shall determine in its reasonable
discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares
of Company Common Stock (neither Parent nor the Company nor the
Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify any stockholder of any such
defect), such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of
Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be
deemed to be Non-Electing Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter
timely made with respect to such shares.

  



  

(f) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent and
the Company, in the exercise of their reasonable discretion, shall have the
joint right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement, governing (i) the manner and extent to which Elections are
to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by _Section
3.2_ , (ii) the issuance and delivery of certificates representing the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are
converted into the right to receive in the Merger and (iii) the method of
payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right
to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, at the Effective Time, for exchange in accordance with this
_Article III_ , (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form
issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ equal to the aggregate Stock
Consideration, and (ii) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate
Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.14_ )
(collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and Parent shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration, and cash in lieu of
fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement. The cash portion of the
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or
the Surviving Entity. Interest and other income on the Exchange Fund shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Entity and shall
be paid to Parent or the Surviving Entity, as Parent directs. No investment of
the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent from making the payments required by this _Article III_ , and
following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the extent necessary to satisfy
Parent's obligations hereunder for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock at the Effective Time, which additional funds will be
deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.

Section 3.5 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender
of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration (which, to the extent Stock Consideration,
shall be in non-certificated book-entry form) in respect of the shares of

the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with
respect thereto) which remains undistributed to the former holders of shares
of Company Common Stock on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time

Stock) to which they are entitled under this _Article III_ shall thereafter
look only to Parent and the Surviving Entity for payment of their claims with

actions required to cancel (effective prior to the Effective Time) each
outstanding Company Option in accordance with the Company's 2011 Stock Option
Plan, including by providing timely notice of cancellation to each holder of a
Company Option. Any holder of a Company Option shall, upon receipt of such
cancellation notice, have the right to exercise his Company Option in
accordance with the Company's 2011 Stock Option Plan, and if any such holder
exercises his Company Option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock, he
shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including Section 3.1(a) (and, for the sake of
clarity, if any Company Option is outstanding at any time after the date

Company's 2011 Stock Option Plan).

  



  

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, any then-outstanding shares of Company Restricted Stock shall
become fully vested and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
such number of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon such
acceleration to satisfy any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes
(assuming a fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock equal to the
closing price of the Company Common Stock on the last completed trading day
immediately prior to the Closing). All shares of Company Common Stock then-
outstanding as a result of the full vesting of the shares of
Company Restricted Stock and the satisfaction of any applicable income and
employment withholding Taxes shall have the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 3.11 _Withholding Rights_. Each and any Parent Party,
the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration, the Partnership Merger Consideration and/or, otherwise, any
other amounts or property otherwise payable or distributable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts or property (or portions thereof) as such Parent Party,
the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment or
distribution under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority by a Parent Party, the Surviving Entity, the Surviving
Partnership or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Parent Party, the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable.

  



  

Section 3.12 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



  

Section 3.13 _Dissenters ' Rights_. No dissenters' or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 3.14 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates or with respect to Book-
Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
shall receive (aggregating for this purpose all the shares of Parent Common
Stock such holder is entitled to receive hereunder), in lieu thereof, cash,
without interest, in an amount equal to the product of (a) such fractional
part of a share of Parent Common Stock, multiplied by (b) the Per Share Cash
Amount, divided by (c) the Per Share Stock Amount.

Section 4.3 _Capital Structure_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
300,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, $0.01 par value per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "). At the
close of business on December 14, 2012, (i) 177,807,713 shares of Company
Common Stock were issued and outstanding, including 17,400 shares of Company
Restricted Stock, (ii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding, (iii) 8,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for
issuance pursuant to the terms of outstanding awards granted pursuant to the
Company Stock Plans, and (iv) 7,982,000 shares of Company Common Stock were
available for grant under the Company Stock Plans. All issued and outstanding
shares of the capital stock of the Company are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and no class of capital stock of the
Company is entitled to preemptive rights. There are no outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matter on which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may
vote. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Company Options
outstanding. _Section 4.3(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, sets forth

this Agreement (A) the name with respect to the holder of Company Restricted
Stock, (B) the number of shares of outstanding Company Restricted Stock, (C)
the date of grant of such Company Restricted Stock, and (D) the vesting

Company Common Stock or Company Partnership Units other than the Company

Option was duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such
Company Option was by its terms to be effective by all necessary corporate
action, including, as applicable, approval by the Company's board of
directors (the " _Company Board_ "), or a committee thereof, and any required
stockholder approval by the necessary number of votes or written consents,
and each Company Option and Company Restricted Stock grant was made in
accordance in all material respects with the terms of the applicable Company
Stock Plan and applicable Law. The per share exercise price of each Company
Option was not less than the fair market value of a share of Company Common
Stock on the applicable grant date. Immediately prior to the Closing, the
Company will provide to Parent a complete and correct list that contains the
information required to be provided in  _Section 4.3(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, that is correct and complete as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , delivery of such updated schedule shall not cure any
breach of this _Section 4.3_ for purposes of determining whether
the applicable closing condition has been satisfied.

the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them is
bound, obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, deliver or
sell or create, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold or created,

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or
incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented
or restated, if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was
prepared (except as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such
consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of
the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

  



  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal
accounting controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored,
maintained and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or accountants,
except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not
reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of
internal accounting controls. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in
accordance with management's authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the
assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets
is permitted only in accordance with management's authorization; (4) the
reporting of such assets is compared with existing assets at regular
intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other receivables and inventory are
recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to
effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. The Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed
to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Company's internal controls, and the Company has made available to
Parent copies of any material written materials relating to the foregoing.
The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company required
to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those
entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in the
Company's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. Since the
enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer
of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under the Exchange Act).

absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i)

which has not been adequately addressed. The Company has made available to
Parent true and complete copies of all written comment letters from the staff
of the SEC received since November 3, 2010 through the date of this Agreement
relating to the Company SEC Filings and all written responses of the Company
thereto through the date of this Agreement. None of the Company SEC

(b) The Company (i) for all of its taxable years commencing with the
Company's initial taxable year that ended on December 31, 2011 and through and
including its taxable year ended December 31 immediately prior to the
Effective Time has elected and has been subject to U.S. federal taxation as a
real estate investment trust within the meaning of and under the provisions of
Section 856 of the Code _et seq_. (a " _REIT_ ") and has satisfied all
requirements to qualify as a REIT, and has so qualified, for U.S. federal
Tax purposes for all such taxable years; (ii) at all times since such date,
has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal Tax
purposes and will continue to operate (including with regard to the REIT
distribution requirements in the taxable year that includes and/or that ends
with and upon the Effective Time) through to the Merger (and the
consummation thereof) in such a manner so as to quality for its taxable year
that will end with Merger (and consummation thereof); and (iii) has not taken
or omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in a
challenge by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority to its status as a
REIT, and no such challenge is pending or, to the Company's knowledge,
threatened. Each Company Subsidiary and Other Company Subsidiary has been
since the later of its acquisition or formation and continues to be treated
for U.S. federal and state income Tax purposes as (A) a partnership (or a
disregarded entity) and not as a corporation or an association or publicly
traded partnership taxable as a corporation, (B) a Qualified REIT Subsidiary,
or (C) a Taxable REIT Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary holds, directly or indirectly, any asset the disposition of which
would be subject to (or to rules similar to) Section 1374 of the Code.

  



  

(c) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received a
written claim, or to the knowledge of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
an unwritten claim, by any Governmental Authority in any jurisdiction where
any of them does not file Tax Returns or pay any Taxes that it is or may be
subject to Taxation by that jurisdiction.

  



  

(d) (i) There are no disputes, audits, examination, investigations
or proceedings pending (or threatened in writing), or claims asserted, for
and/or in respect of any Taxes or material Tax Returns of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is
a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding relating to Taxes;
(ii) no deficiency for Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, by any Governmental Authority, which deficiency has not
yet been settled, except for such deficiencies which are being contested in
good faith or with respect to which the failure to pay, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has extended or waived (nor granted any extension or waiver of)
the limitation period for the assessment or collection of any Tax that has not
since expired; (iv) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary currently
is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
material Tax Return that remains unfiled; and (v) neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has entered into any "closing agreement" as described in
Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state,
local or foreign income Tax Law).

  



  

(e) Since the Company's formation, (i) neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has incurred any liability for Taxes under Sections
857(b),857(f), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code; and (ii) neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for any other
Taxes other than (x) in the ordinary course of business or consistent with
past practice, or (y) transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with
sales of property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance
exists, which presents a material risk that any material amount of Tax
described in the previous sentence will be imposed upon the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.

(f) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections
1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 3102 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under

case, have paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any and all
material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the
due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

  



  

(g) There are no Company Tax Protection Agreements currently in
force, and no Person has raised, or to the knowledge of the Company or the
Company Operating Partnership threatened to raise, a material claim against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any breach of any Company Tax
Protection Agreement and none of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will give rise to any liability or obligation to make any payment
under any Company Tax Protection Agreement. As used herein, " _Company Tax
Protection Agreements_ " means any agreement to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party and pursuant to which (i) any liability to any
direct or indirect holder of Company Partnership Units or any other

whether or not as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with the

refrain from making Tax elections, (D) operate (or refrain from operating) in

subsidiaries, (F) use (or refrain from using) a particular method for
allocating one or more liabilities of such party or any of its direct or
indirect subsidiaries under Section 752 of the Code and/or (G) only dispose

be given the opportunity to guaranty, indemnify or assume debt of such
Company Subsidiary Partnership or any direct or indirect subsidiary of such
Company Subsidiary Partnership or are so guarantying or indemnifying, or have
so assumed, such debt; and/or (iv) any other agreement that would require
any Company Subsidiary Partnership or the general partner, manager, managing
member or other similarly-situated Person of such Company Subsidiary
Partnership or any direct or indirect subsidiary of such Company Subsidiary
Partnership to consider separately the interests of the limited partners,
members or other beneficial owners of such Company Subsidiary Partnership or
the holder of interests in such Company Subsidiary Partnership in connection
with any transaction or other action. As used herein, " _Company
Subsidiary Partnership_ " means a Company Subsidiary or Other Company
Subsidiary that is a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes.

Company or any Company Subsidiary except Liens for Taxes not yet due and

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries) has or has had any earnings and profits
attributable to such entity or any other corporation in any non-REIT year
within the meaning of Section 857 of the Code.

  



  

(n) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company is not aware of

Section 5.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) Parent has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available
basis) to, the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents
required to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements
thereto, from and after February 11, 2011 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC
Filings_ "). Each Parent SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date
of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became
effective in the case of registration statements), or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Merger Sub nor any other Parent Subsidiary is separately subject to
the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or
incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Filings (as amended, supplemented
or restated, if applicable), including the related notes and schedules, was
prepared (except as indicated in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each such
consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

  



  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries that are used in the system of internal accounting
controls described in the following sentence are recorded, stored, maintained
and operated under means that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or accountants, except
for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not
reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of
internal accounting controls. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have devised
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in
accordance with management's authorization; (2) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the assets of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets
is compared with existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts,
notes and other receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper
and adequate procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a
current and timely basis. Parent's principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer have disclosed to Parent's auditors and the
audit committee of the Parent Board (i) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal controls, and
Parent has made available to the Company copies of any material written
materials relating to the foregoing. Parent has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15
promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material
information relating to Parent required to be included in reports filed
under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
known to Parent's principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in
which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being
prepared, and, to the knowledge of Parent, such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in Parent's periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any
director or executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated
under the Exchange Act).

(d) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on
Parent's most recent balance sheet (or, in the notes thereto) included in the
Parent SEC Filings, none of Parent or its consolidated subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly
contemplated by or under this Agreement, including _Section 6.2_ hereof, (ii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since the most recent balance sheet set forth in the Parent SEC Filings made
through and including the date of this Agreement, (iii) described in any
section of the Parent Disclosure Letter or (iv) that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(e) To the knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Filings is
the subject of ongoing SEC review and Parent has not received any comments
from the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Filings since February 11,
2011 which remains unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or
information request from the SEC as to any matters affecting Parent which has
not been adequately addressed. Parent has made available to the Company true
and complete copies of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC
received since February 11, 2011 through the date of this Agreement relating
to the Parent SEC Filings and all written responses of Parent thereto through
the date of this Agreement. None of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject of
any confidential treatment request by Parent.

supplemented or at the time such document is declared effective by the SEC,

not misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is

time the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. All documents that Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, to the extent
relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or other information supplied by
or on behalf of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for inclusion therein, will
comply as to form, in all material respects, with the provisions of the
Securities Act or Exchange Act, as applicable and the rules and regulations
of the SEC thereunder and each such document required to be filed with any
Governmental Authority (other than the SEC) will comply in all material
respects with the provisions of any applicable Law as to the
information required to be contained therein.

Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company or Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement
to, any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto,
and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC
of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or

Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall,
through the Parent Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the
Parent Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement, and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Parent Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 6.3(d)_ , if, on a date for which the Parent Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have the right to make one or
more successive postponements or adjournments of the Parent Stockholder
Meeting; _provided_ that the Parent Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than (i) thirty (30) days after the date for
which the Parent Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law) or (ii) one hundred
twenty (120) days after the record date for the Parent Stockholder Meeting.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Parent of its
obligation to submit the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the approval
thereof.

efforts to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder
Meeting on the same date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, each of the Company Parties, on the one hand, and the Parent Parties, on
the other hand, shall, and the Company Parties and the Parent Parties shall
cause each of the other Parent Entities and the other Company Entities,

(ii) all other information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other parties may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company Parties nor the Parent
Parties shall be required by this _Section 6.4_ to provide the other party or
the Representatives of such other party with access to or to disclose
information (w) relating to the consideration, negotiation and performance of
this Agreement and related agreements, (x) that is subject to the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such
third party to such access or disclosure), (y) the disclosure of which would
violate any Law or fiduciary duty ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the
withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation
of any Law or fiduciary duty) or (z) that is subject to any attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the withholding party shall allow for such access or disclosure to the
maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege). Each of the parties hereto
will use its reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the
businesses of the other parties that may result from the requests for access,
data and information hereunder.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties hereto will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ , in confidence to

encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer or request
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Acquisition Proposal (an " _Inquiry_ "), (ii) engage in any discussions or

at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Parties may, directly or indirectly through any Representative, in response
to an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal by a
Third Party made after the date of this Agreement (that did not result from a
breach of this _Section 6.5_ ) (i) furnish non-public information to such
Third Party (and such Third Party's Representatives) making a Company
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company receives from the Third Party an
executed Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) any non-public
information concerning the Company Entities that is provided to such Third
Party shall, to the extent not previously provided to Parent or Merger Sub, be
provided to Parent or Merger Sub prior to or substantially at the same time
that such information is provided to such Third Party), and (ii) engage in
discussions or negotiations with such Third Party (and such Third Party's
Representatives) with respect to the Company Acquisition Proposal if, in the
case of each of clauses (i) and (ii): (x) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Company Superior Proposal, and (y) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to

Company Acquisition Proposal or provides nonpublic information or data to any
Person in accordance with this _Section 6.5(c)_ and keep Parent informed of
the status and material terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions or
negotiations on a current basis, including by providing a copy of all

and (iv) of this _Section 6.5(d)_ , a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), or (v) approve, adopt, declare advisable or
recommend (or agree to, resolve or propose to approve, adopt, declare
advisable or recommend), or cause or permit any Company Entity to enter into,
any Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement (other than a Company
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this
_Section 6.5_ ). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board shall be permitted to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Company Board (A) (x) has received an
unsolicited bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from
a breach of this _Section 6.5_ ) that, in the good faith determination of the
Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, after having complied
with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by the
Parent Parties pursuant to  _Section 6.5(e)_ , and such Company Acquisition
Proposal is not withdrawn, and (y) determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors' duties under applicable Law, and in
such case the Company may (i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ or (ii) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, including
approving or recommending such Company Superior Proposal to the Company's
stockholders, and, in the case of a termination, the Company may immediately
prior to or concurrently with such termination of this Agreement, enter into

Superior Proposal; or (B) determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors' duties under applicable Law (based on circumstances not
covered by clause (A)), and, in such case the Company may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, provided, that, in the case of each of
clause (A) and clause (B), in the event of any termination by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ , as may be
applicable, the Company Parties comply with their obligation to pay the
Parent Expense Amount pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_.

  



   

81

(e) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_ unless (i) the
Company has provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") to the Parent Parties that the Company intends to
take such action, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor and, in
the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section
6.5(d)(A)_ , describing the material terms and conditions of, and attaching a
complete copy of, the Company Superior Proposal that is the basis of such
action (it being understood that such material terms shall include
the identity of the Third Party), (ii) during the five (5) Business Day
period following the Parent Parties' receipt of the Notice of Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, negotiate with the Parent Parties in good faith (to the extent the Parent
Parties desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change is no longer necessary, and (iii) following the end of the five (5)
Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking
into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by the
Parent Parties in response to the Notice of Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or otherwise, (x) that in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)(A)_ , the Company Superior Proposal giving
rise to the Notice of Company Adverse Recommendation Change, continues to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal and, (y) after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors' duties under applicable Law. Any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material amendment of such Company Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
and the Company Parties shall be required to comply again with the
requirements of this _Section 6.5(e)_.

  



  

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or
indirectly through its Representatives, from disclosing to the Company's
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board has determined, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure other than
a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any
applicable Company Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the
Company Recommendation (and/or an express reaffirmation the Company's approval
of the Partnership Merger) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.

  



  

(g) The Company Parties shall, and shall cause each of the other
Company Entities, and its and their officers and directors, managers or
equivalent, and other Representatives to (i) immediately cease any existing
discussions, negotiations or communications with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) take
such action as is necessary to enforce any confidentiality provisions or
provisions of similar effect to which any Company Entity is a party or of
which any Company Entity is a beneficiary. The Company Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause all Third Parties who have been furnished
confidential information regarding any Company Entity in connection with the
solicitation of or discussions regarding a Company Acquisition Proposal within
the six (6) months prior to the date of this Agreement to promptly return or
destroy such information (to the extent that they are entitled to have such
information returned or destroyed).

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of
the Parent Parties and the Company Parties shall give (or shall cause the
other Parent Entities or the other Company Entities, respectively, to give)
any notices to Third Parties, and each of the Parent Parties and the Company

without giving the other parties the opportunity to attend or participate
(whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than
any Governmental Authority) with respect to the Mergers, none of the parties

Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Company Parties shall give prompt notice to the Parent
Parties, and the Parent Parties shall give prompt notice to the Company

respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or

shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent Parties shall
give prompt notice to the Company Parties, if, to the knowledge of such

conditions to Closing set forth herein not to be satisfied or satisfaction to
be materially delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the failure by the Company Parties or the Parent Parties to provide
such prompt notice under this _Section 6.8(b)_ shall not constitute a breach
of covenant for purposes of _Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_.

  



  

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to give prompt written notice
to the other parties upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending

exchange or the applicable provisions of any listing agreement of any
party hereto. If for any reason it is not practicable to consult with the

Section 6.10 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and
Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall
provide exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for each
Indemnitee, which is at least as favorable in scope and amount to such
Indemnitee as the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided to such Indemnitee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time in the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws or each of the Company Subsidiaries' respective articles or
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or
governing documents), as in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_
that such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses covers
actions at or prior to the Effective Time, including all transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the provisions of  _Section 6.10(a)_ , during
the period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to): (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such Action arises
out of or pertains to (x) any action or omission or alleged action or
omission in such Indemnitee's capacity as a director, officer, partner,
member, trustee, employee or agent of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or (y) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Mergers; and (ii) pay in advance of the final
disposition of any such Action the expenses (including attorneys' fees and any
expenses incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with enforcing any rights
with respect to indemnification) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Entity (i) shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (ii) shall not have
any obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order
that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the
Indemnitee shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity the amount
of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the
Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable
extension of the coverage afforded by the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each
case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from one or more
insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions and retentions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
coverage provided under the Company's existing policies and with limits of
liability that are no lower than the limits on the Company's existing policies
as long as the annual premium in the aggregate does not exceed in any one
year three hundred percent (300%) of the annual aggregate premium(s) the
Company's paid for such purpose with respect to the period from March 31, 2011
to March 31, 2012 (which aggregate premiums with respect to the period from
March 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012 are hereby represented and warranted by the
Company to be $175,000). If the Company or the Surviving Entity for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Entity shall continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Company's
current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage
provided under the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii)
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide, for a
period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Indemnitees who are insured under the Company's DandO Insurance with comparable
DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Company's current insurance carrier, that is no less favorable in the
aggregate than the existing policy of the Company (which may be
provided under Parent's DandO Insurance policy) or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay
an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of (for any one year) three
hundred percent (300%) of the annual aggregate premium(s) the Company's paid
for such purpose with respect to the calendar year 2011; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, or the Surviving
Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall
be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors'
and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in
existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 6.10_ is not prior to, or in substitution for,
any such claims under any such policies.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section
9.7_ to the contrary, this _Section 6.10_ shall survive the consummation of
the Mergers indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries,
and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of
its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in

the payment and performance of the Surviving Entity's obligations pursuant to

368(a) of the Code.

respect to the shares of Company Common Stock or the Company OP Units
permitted under the terms of this Agreement has (i) a record date prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) has not been paid as of the Effective Time,
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company OP Units, as

Agreement, the parties agree that:

  



  

(i) under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be required
to pay the Parent Expense Amount or the Company Expense Amount, as applicable,
earlier than one (1) full Business Day after receipt of appropriate wire
transfer instructions from the party entitled to payment; and

  



  

(ii) under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be required
to pay the Parent Expense Amount or the Company Expense Amount, as applicable,
on more than one occasion.

  



  

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the Expense Amount is not a penalty, but
is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee
is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and
(iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in
order to obtain such payment, either the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for
the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.3_ , such paying party
shall pay the other party its costs and Expenses in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%)
for the period from the date such payment was required to be made through the

permitted by applicable Law.

(d) (i) If one party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Payor_ ")
is required to pay another party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Payee_
") an Expense Amount, such Expense Amount shall be paid into escrow on the
date such payment is required to be paid by the Termination Payor pursuant to
this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an escrow
account designated in accordance with this _Section 8.3(d)_. In the event
that the Termination Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Payee the
Expense Amount, the amount payable to the Termination Payee in any tax year
of the Termination Payee shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Expense
Amount of the Termination Payee, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount
that can be paid to the Termination Payee without causing the Termination
Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code for the relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount
did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the
Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and the Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of
income from unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income
(in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not
Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by the Termination Payee's
independent accountants, plus (B) in the event the Termination Payee receives
either (x) a letter from the Termination Payee's counsel indicating that the
Termination Payee has received a ruling from the IRS as described below in
this _Section 8.3(d)_ or (y) an opinion from the Termination Payee's
outside counsel as described below in this _Section 8.3(d)_ , an amount equal
to the excess of the Expense Amount less the amount payable under clause (A)
above.

  



  

(ii) To secure the Termination Payor's obligation to pay these
amounts, the Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash
equal to the Expense Amount with an escrow agent selected by the Termination
Payor on such terms (subject to this _Section 8.3(d)_ ) as shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Termination Payor, the Termination Payee and the escrow
agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Expense Amount pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be made at the time the Termination Payor is
obligated to pay the Termination Payee such amount pursuant to _Section 8.3_
by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Expense Amount
in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Termination
Payee unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the
following: (i) a letter from the Termination Payee's independent accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the
Termination Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and the
Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such
year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated
income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall
release such amount to the Termination Payee, or (ii) a letter from the
Termination Payee's counsel indicating that (A) the Termination Payee
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination
Payee of the Expense Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code or (B) the Termination Payee's outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Termination
Payee of the Expense Amount should either constitute Qualifying Income or
should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Expense Amount to the Termination Payee. The Termination
Payor agrees to amend this _Section 8.3(d)_ at the reasonable request of the
Termination Payee in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Expense Amount
that may be distributed to the Termination Payee hereunder without causing
the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve the Termination Payee's chances of securing
a favorable ruling described in this _Section 8.3(d)_ or (iii) assist the
Termination Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside
counsel as described in this _Section 8.3(d)_. Any amount of the Expense
Amount that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as
soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing
limitations of this _Section 8.3(d)_ , _provided_  that the obligation of the
Termination Payor to pay the unpaid portion of the Expense Amount shall
terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five (5) years from
the date of this Agreement.

directors (or similar governing body or entity) at any time before or after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder
Approval and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, there shall not be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes
the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this
Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law
or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires the further
approval of the stockholders of the Company or Parent without such further
approval of such stockholders, or (b) any amendment or change not
permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c)
subject to the proviso of _Section 8.4_ , waive compliance with any agreement
or condition contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

  



  

Section 8.6 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such Expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
and Parent shall share equally all Expenses related to the printing and
filing of the Form S-4 and the printing, filing and distribution of the Joint
Proxy Statement, other than attorneys' and accountants' fees.

  



  

Section 8.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real
property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer
or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any
similar taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (together with any related interests,
penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and shall cooperate in
attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity and the Surviving Partnership shall pay
or cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from any consideration
or amounts payable to holders of the Company Common Stock, all Transfer
Taxes.

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Other than to the
Surviving Entity and the Surviving Partnership, neither this Agreement nor
any rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by any of the parties hereto (whether by

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is
not intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, except for the provisions of Section 6.10 (from and after the

of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with

warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  



  

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto
do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

Partnership distributions; (iii) the rights of each such class or series of
Partnership Units upon dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership; and
(iv) the right, if any, of the holder of each such class or series of
Partnership Units to vote on Partnership matters; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no additional Partnership Units shall be issued to the General Partner
(or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner)
unless:

  



  

(1) (A) the additional Partnership Units are issued in connection
with an issuance of REIT Shares of or other interests in the General Partner,
which shares or interests have designations, preferences and other rights, all
such that the economic interests are substantially similar to the
designations, preferences and other rights of the additional Partnership Units
issued to the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the General Partner) by the Partnership in accordance with this
Section 4.02 and (B) the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) shall make a Capital Contribution to
the Partnership in an amount equal to the consideration received by the
General Partner from the issuance of such REIT Shares or other interests in
the General Partner;

  



   

24 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(2) (A) the additional Partnership Units are issued in connection
with an issuance of REIT Shares of or other interests in the General Partner
pursuant to a taxable share dividend declared by the General Partner, which
shares or interests have designations, preferences and other rights, all such
that the economic interests are substantially similar to the designations,
preferences and other rights of the additional Partnership Units issued to
the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
General Partner) by the Partnership in accordance with this Section 4.02, (B)
if the General Partner allows the holders of its REIT Shares to elect whether
to receive such dividend in REIT Shares, other interests of the General
Partner or cash, the Partnership will give the Limited Partners (excluding
the General Partner or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the General
Partner) the same election to elect to receive (I) Partnership Units or cash
or, (II) at the election of the General Partner, REIT Shares or cash, and (C)
if the Partnership issues additional Partnership Units pursuant to this
Section 4.02(a)(i)(2), then an amount of income equal to the value of the
Partnership Units received will be allocated to those holders of OP Units that
elect to receive additional Partnership Units;

  



  

(3) the additional Partnership Units are issued in exchange for
property owned by the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the General Partner) with a fair market value, as determined by
the General Partner, in good faith, equal to the value of the Partnership
Units; or

  



  

(4) the additional Partnership Units are issued to all Partners in
proportion to their respective Percentage Interests.

  



  

Without limiting the foregoing, the General Partner is expressly authorized
to cause the Partnership to issue Partnership Units for less than fair market
value, so long as the General Partner concludes in good faith that such
issuance is in the best interests of the General Partner and the Partnership.

  



  

Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the General Partner may
amend this Agreement in any manner in connection with the creation,
authorization and/or issuance of any additional Partnership Interests, all
without the approval of the Limited Partners or any other Person.

(ii) _Upon Issuance of Additional Securities_. The General Partner
shall not issue any additional REIT Shares (other than REIT Shares issued in
connection with an exchange pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof or a taxable share
dividend as described in Section 4.02(a)(i)(2) hereof) or Rights
(collectively, "Additional Securities") other than to all holders of REIT
Shares, unless (A) the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to issue
to the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
the General Partner) Partnership Units or Rights having designations,
preferences and other rights, all such that the economic interests are
substantially similar to those of the Additional Securities, and (B) the
General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
General Partner) contributes the proceeds from the issuance of such Additional
Securities and from any exercise of Rights contained in such Additional
Securities to the Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
General Partner is allowed to issue Additional Securities in connection with
an acquisition of Property to be held directly by the General Partner (or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner), but if and
only if, such direct acquisition and issuance of Additional Securities have
been approved by a majority of the Independent Directors. Without limiting the
foregoing, the General Partner is expressly authorized to issue Additional
Securities for less than fair market value, and the General Partner is
authorized to cause the Partnership to issue to the General Partner (or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner)
corresponding Partnership Units, so long as (x) the General Partner concludes
in good faith that such issuance is in the best interests of the Partnership
and (y) the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of the General Partner) contributes all proceeds from such issuance to the
Partnership, including without limitation, the issuance of REIT Shares and
corresponding Partnership Units pursuant to a share purchase plan providing
for purchases of REIT Shares at a discount from fair market value or pursuant
to share awards, including share options that have an exercise price that is
less than the fair market value of the REIT Shares, either at the time of
issuance or at the time of exercise, and restricted or other share
awards approved by the Board of Directors. For example, in the event the
General Partner issues REIT Shares for a cash purchase price and the General
Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General
Partner) contributes all of the proceeds of such issuance to the Partnership
as required hereunder, the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the General Partner) shall be issued a number of
additional Partnership Units equal to the product of (A) the number of
such REIT Shares issued by the General Partner, the proceeds of which were so
contributed, multiplied by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is 100%,
and the denominator of which is the Conversion Factor in effect on the date of
such contribution.

  



  

(b) _Certain Contributions of Proceeds of Issuance of REIT Shares_.
In connection with any and all issuances of REIT Shares, the General Partner
(or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner)
shall make Capital Contributions to the Partnership of the proceeds
therefrom, _provided_ , that if the proceeds actually received and contributed
by the General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
the General Partner) are less than the gross proceeds of such issuance as a
result of any underwriter's discount, commissions, placement fees or other
expenses paid or incurred in connection with such issuance, then the General
Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the General
Partner) shall make a Capital Contribution to the Partnership constituting
the sum of (i) such net proceeds and (ii) an intangible asset in an amount
equal to the capitalized costs of the General Partner relating to such
issuance of REIT Shares or other interests in the General Partner. Upon any
such Capital Contribution by the General Partner (or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner), the Capital Account of the
General Partner (or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
General Partner) shall be increased by the amount of its Capital Contribution
as described in the previous sentence.

  



   

26 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) _Repurchases of Shares_. If the General Partner shall
repurchase shares of any class of its shares of common stock, the purchase
price thereof and all costs incurred in connection with such repurchase shall
be reimbursed to the General Partner by the Partnership pursuant to Section
6.05 hereof and the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to redeem an
equivalent number of Partnership Units of the appropriate class or series
held by the General Partner (which, in the case of REIT Shares, shall be a
number equal to the quotient of the number of such REIT Shares divided by the
Conversion Factor) in the manner provided in Section 6.10 hereof.

  



  

4.03 _Additional Funding_. If the General Partner determines that it
is in the best interests of the Partnership to provide for
additional Partnership funds ("Additional Funds") for any Partnership
purpose, the General Partner may (i) cause the Partnership to obtain such
funds from outside borrowings, or (ii) elect to have the General Partner or
any of its Affiliates provide such Additional Funds to the Partnership
through loans or otherwise.

  



  

4.04 _Capital Accounts_. A separate Capital Account shall be
established and maintained for each Partner.

  



  

4.05 _Percentage Interests_. If the number of outstanding OP Units,
Manager's Units or other class or series of Partnership Units increases or
decreases during a taxable year, each Partner's Percentage Interest shall be
adjusted by the General Partner effective as of the effective date of each
such increase or decrease to a percentage equal to the number of OP Units,
Manager's Units or other class or series of Partnership Units held by such
Partner divided by the aggregate number of OP Units, Manager's Units or other
class or series of Partnership Units, as applicable, outstanding after giving
effect to such increase or decrease. If the Partners' Percentage Interests
are adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.05, the Net Income and Net Loss for
the taxable year in which the adjustment occurs shall be allocated between
the part of the year ending on the effective date of such adjustment and the
part of the year beginning on the following day either (i) as if the taxable
year had ended on the date of the adjustment or (ii) based on the number of
days in each part. The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion,
shall determine which method shall be used to allocate Net Income and Net
Loss for the taxable year in which the adjustment occurs. The allocation of
Net Income and Net Loss for the earlier part of the year shall be based on the
Percentage Interests before adjustment, and the allocation of Net Income and
Net Loss for the later part shall be based on the adjusted Percentage
Interests.

  



  

4.06 _No Interest on Contributions_. No Partner shall be entitled to
interest on its Capital Contribution.

  



  

4.07 _Return of Capital Contributions_. No Partner shall be entitled
to withdraw any part of its Capital Contribution or its Capital Account or to
receive any distribution from the Partnership, except as specifically provided
in this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein, there shall be no
obligation to return to any Partner or withdrawn Partner any part of such
Partner's Capital Contribution for so long as the Partnership continues in
existence.

  



   

27 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

4.08 _No Third-Party Beneficiary_. No creditor or other third party
(other than an Indemnitee) having dealings with the Partnership shall have
the right to enforce the right or obligation of any Partner to make Capital
Contributions or loans or to pursue any other right or remedy hereunder or at
law or in equity, it being understood and agreed that the provisions of this
Agreement shall be solely for the benefit of, and may be enforced solely by,
the parties hereto, Indemnitees and their respective successors and assigns.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the rights or obligations of
the Partners herein set forth to make Capital Contributions or loans to the
Partnership shall be deemed an asset of the Partnership for any purpose by any
creditor or other third party, nor may such rights or obligations be sold,
transferred or assigned by the Partnership or pledged or encumbered by the
Partnership to secure any debt or other obligation of the Partnership or of
any of the Partners. In addition, it is the intent of the parties hereto that
no distribution to any Limited Partner shall be deemed a return of money or
other property in violation of the Act. However, if any court of competent
jurisdiction holds that, notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, any
Limited Partner is obligated to return such money or property, such
obligation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the
obligation of such Limited Partner and not of the General Partner. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, a deficit Capital Account of a
Partner shall not be deemed to be a liability of such Partner nor an asset or
property of the Partnership.

  



  

ARTICLE V _ 
 NET INCOME AND NET LOSS; DISTRIBUTIONS_

  



  

5.01 _Allocations_. 

  



  

(a) _Allocations of Net Income and Net Loss_. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, after giving effect to the special allocations in
Sections 5.01(c) and 5.01(d), Net Income, Net Loss and, to the extent
necessary, individual items of income, gain, loss or deduction, of the
Partnership, without duplication, shall be allocated among the Partners as

(i) _first_ , if the Partnership has Net Income for any taxable
year or portion thereof, such Net Income shall be allocated to the Partners
holding Series A Preferred Units and/or Series B Preferred Units _pro rata_
and _pari passu_ in proportion to their relative number of Partnership Units
to the extent of and until such Partners have received allocations of Net
Income equal to the aggregate amount of distributions made to such Partners
pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(i); and

  



   

28 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) _thereafter_ , to the Partners holding OP Units, Manager's
Units and/or Class B Units _pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in accordance with
each such Partner's respective Percentage Interest with respect to such OP
Units, Manager's Units and/or Class B Units; _provided_ , that for the
avoidance of doubt, Net Loss, and to the extent necessary, individual items of
loss or deductions shall be allocated (A) first to the Partners holding OP
Units, Manager's Units and/or Class B Units _pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in
accordance with each such Partner's respective Percentage Interest with
respect to such OP Units, Manager's Units and/or Class B Units until each
such Partner's Capital Accounts with respect to their OP Units, Manager's
Units and/or Class B Units has been reduced to zero, but not below zero (
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the Capital Account of one or more such
Partner, but not all such Partners, has been reduced to zero, any remaining
Net Loss, and to the extent necessary, individual item of loss or deduction
shall be allocated to the remaining Partners holding OP Units, Manager's Units
and/or Class B Units in the same manner as in this Section 5.01(a)(ii)(A)
until the Capital Account of all such Partners with respect to such OP Units,
Manager's Units and/or Class B Units has been reduced to zero) (B) then to the
Partners holding Series A Preferred Units and/or Series B Preferred Units
_pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in proportion to their relative number of
Partnership Units until the Capital Accounts of such Partners with respect to
their Series A Preferred Units and/or Series B Preferred Units has been
reduced to zero, and (C) thereafter to the General Partner.

  



  

(b) _Allocations of Net Property Gain and Net Property Loss_.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to Section
5.01(c), after giving effect to the special allocations in Section 5.01(d),
Net Property Gain, Net Property Loss and, to the extent necessary, individual
items of gain or loss comprising Net Property Gain and Net Property Loss of
the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners as follows:

  



  

(i) _first_ , if the Partnership has Net Property Gain for any
taxable year or portion thereof, such Net Property Gain shall be allocated
to the Partners holding Series A Preferred Units and/or Series B Preferred
Units _pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in proportion to their relative number of
Partnership Units until each such Partners' Capital Accounts is equal to such
Partner's aggregate Series A Liquidation Amount and/or Series B Liquidation
Amount;

  



  

(ii) _second_ , the Partners holding Series A Preferred Units and/or
Series B Preferred Units _pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in proportion to their
relative number of Partnership Units to the extent of and until such Partners
have received allocations of Net Property Gain equal to the aggregate amount
of distributions made to such Partners pursuant to Sections 5.02(b)(i); and

  



  

(iii) _thereafter_ , to the Partners holding OP Units and/or
Manager's Units _pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in accordance with each
such Partner's respective Percentage Interest with respect to such OP Units
and/or Manager's Units; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, Net
Property Loss, and to the extent necessary, individual items of loss shall be
allocated (A) first to the Partners holding OP Units and/or Manager's Units
_pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in accordance with each such Partner's respective
Percentage Interest with respect to such OP Units and/or Manager's Units until
the Capital Accounts of such Partners with respect to their OP Units and/or
Manager's Units has been reduced to zero, (B) then to the partners holding
Class B Units, if any, until their Economic Capital Account Balances have been
reduced to zero, (C) then to the Partners holding Series A Preferred Units
and/or Series B Preferred Units _pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in proportion to
their relative number of Partnership Units until the Capital Accounts of such
Partners with respect to their Series A Preferred Units and/or Series B
Preferred Units has been reduced to zero, and (D) thereafter to the General
Partner.

(c) _Special Allocations Regarding Class B Units_. After giving
effect to the special allocations in Section 5.01(d) but prior to any
allocations under subparagraphs 5.01(b)(iii), Net Property Gain and, to the
extent necessary, individual items of income and gain comprising Net Property
Gain of the Partnership, shall be allocated to the Partners holding Class B
Units until their Economic Capital Account Balances are equal to (A) the OP
Unit Economic Balance, multiplied by (B) the number of their Class B Units;
_provided_ , that no such Net Property Gain and, to the extent necessary,
individual items of income and gain comprising Net Property Gain of the
Partnership, will be allocated with respect to any particular Class B Unit
unless and to the extent that the OP Unit Economic Balance exceeds the OP
Unit Economic Balance in existence at the time such Class B Unit was issued.
The "Economic Capital Account Balances" of the Class B Unit holders will be
equal to their Capital Account balances to the extent attributable to their
ownership of Class B Units. The "OP Unit Economic Balance" shall mean (Y) the
aggregate Capital Account balance attributable to the OP Units outstanding,
plus the amount of any Partner Minimum Gain or Partnership Minimum Gain, in
either case to the extent attributable to the ownership of OP Units and
computed on a hypothetical basis after taking into account all allocations
through the date on which any allocation is made under this Section 5.01(c),
divided by (Z) the number of OP Units outstanding. Any allocations made
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.01(c) shall be made among the
holders of Class B Units in proportion to the amounts required to be
allocated to each under this Section 5.01(c). The parties agree that the
intent of this Section 5.01(c) is to make the Capital Account balance
associated with each Class B Unit to be economically equivalent to the
Capital Account balance associated with the OP Units outstanding (on a per-
Unit basis), but only if and to the extent that the Capital Account balance
associated with the OP Units outstanding, without regard to the allocations
under this Section 5.01(c), has increased on a per-Unit basis since the
issuance of the relevant Class B Unit. Any remaining Net Property Gain not
allocated pursuant to this Section 5.01(c) shall be allocated pursuant to
Section 5.01(b). To the extent Net Property Loss is allocated to Partners
holding Class B Units pursuant to Section 5.01(b)(iii)(B), such Net Property
Loss shall be allocated among the Partners holding Class B Units in a manner
that reverses the allocation of Net Property Gain to such Partner pursuant to
this Section 5.01(c).

  



  

(d) _Regulatory Allocations_.

  



  

(i) _Minimum Gain Chargeback (Nonrecourse Liabilities)_. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 1.704-2(f) of the Regulations, if there is a
net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain for any Partnership fiscal year, each
Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for
such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to such
Partner's share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain to the extent
required by Section 1.704-2(f) of the Regulations. The items to be so
allocated shall be determined in accordance with Sections 1.704-2(f) and (i)
of the Regulations. This Section 5.01(d)(i) is intended to comply with the
minimum gain chargeback requirement in said section of the Regulations and
shall be interpreted consistently therewith. Allocations pursuant to this
Section 5.01(d)(i) shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts
required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant hereto.

  



   

30 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) _Partner Minimum Gain Chargeback_. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Regulations, if there is a net decrease in
Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any fiscal year, each Partner who
has a share of the Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain, determined in
accordance with Section 1.704-2(i)(5) of the Regulations, shall be specially
allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if
necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to that Partner's share of the
net decrease in the Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain to the extent and
in the manner required by Section 1.704-2(i) of the Regulations. The items to
be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Sections 1.704-2(i)(4)
and (j)(2) of the Regulations. This Section 5.01(d)(ii) is intended to comply
with the minimum gain chargeback requirement with respect to Partner
Nonrecourse Debt contained in said section of the Regulations and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith. Allocations pursuant to this
Section 5.01(d)(ii) shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts
required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant hereto.

  



  

(iii) _Qualified Income Offset_. If a Partner unexpectedly receives
any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) of the Regulations, and such Partner has
an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, items of Partnership income
(including gross income) and gain shall be specially allocated to such
Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate the Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit as quickly as possible as required by the Regulations. This
Section 5.01(d)(iii) is intended to constitute a "qualified income offset"
under Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Regulations and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith.

  



  

(iv) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions for any fiscal
year or other applicable period shall be allocated to the Partners in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

  



  

(v) _Partner Nonrecourse Deductions_. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions
for any fiscal year or other applicable period with respect to a
Partner Nonrecourse Debt shall be specially allocated to the Partner that
bears the economic risk of loss for such Partner Nonrecourse Debt (as
determined under Sections 1.704-2(b)(4) and 1.704-2(i)(1) of the Regulations)

  



  

(vi) _Section 754 Adjustment_. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any asset of the Partnership pursuant to Section
734(b) of the Code or Section 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m) of the Regulations, to be taken into account in
determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the
basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and such
gain or loss shall be specially allocated among the Partners in a manner
consistent with the manner in which each of their respective Capital Accounts
are required to be adjusted pursuant to such section of the Regulations.

  



   

31 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(vii) _Capital Account Deficits_. If any Partner has an Adjusted
Capital Account Deficit at the end of any fiscal year or other
applicable period which is in excess of the amount such Partner is obligated
to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5), such Partner shall be specially
allocated items of Partnership income and gain in the amount of such excess
as quickly as possible, _provided_ , that an allocation pursuant to this
Section 5.01(d)(vii) shall be made only if and to the extent that such
Partner would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit in excess of such
amount after all other allocations provided for under this Agreement have
been made as if Section 5.01(d)(iii) and this Section 5.01(d)(vii) were not
in this Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Allocations Between Transferor and Transferee_. If a Partner
transfers any part or all of its Partnership Interest, the distributive
shares of the various items of Net Income and Net Loss allocable among the
Partners during such fiscal year of the Partnership shall be allocated
between the transferor and the transferee Partner either (i) as if the
Partnership's fiscal year had ended on the date of the transfer or (ii) based
on the number of days of such fiscal year that each was a Partner without
regard to the results of Partnership activities in the respective portions of
such fiscal year in which the transferor and the transferee were
Partners. The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall
determine which method shall be used to allocate the distributive shares of
the various items of Net Income and Net Loss between the transferor and the
transferee Partner.

  



  

(f) _Tax Allocations_.

  



  

(i) _Items of Income or Loss_. Except as is otherwise provided in
this Section 5.01, an allocation of Net Income, Net Loss, Net Property Gain
or Net Property Loss to a Partner shall be treated as an allocation to such
Partner of the same share of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and
item of tax-exempt income or Section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditure (or item treated
as such expenditure pursuant to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(i) of the
Regulations) ("Tax Items") that is taken into account in computing
Net Income, Net Loss, Net Property Gain or Net Property Loss.

  



  

(ii) _Section 1245/1250 Recapture_. Subject to Section 5.01(f)(iii)
below, if any portion of gain from the sale of Partnership assets is
treated as gain which is ordinary income by virtue of the application of
Sections 1245 or 1250 of the Code ("Affected Gain"), then such Affected Gain
shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportion that the
depreciation and amortization deductions giving rise to the Affected Gain
were allocated. This Section 5.01(f)(ii) shall not alter the amount of Net
Income or Net Property Gain (or items thereof) allocated among the Partners,
but merely the character of such Net Income or Net Property Gain (or
items thereof). For purposes hereof, in order to determine the proportionate
allocations of depreciation and amortization deductions for each fiscal year
or other applicable period, such deductions shall be deemed allocated on the
same basis as Net Income, Net Loss, Net Property Gain and Net Property Loss
for such respective period.

  



   

32 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(iii) _Precontribution Gain, Revaluations_. With respect to any
Contributed Property, the Partnership shall use any permissible method
contained in the Regulations promulgated under Section 704(c) of the Code
selected by the General Partner, in its sole discretion, to take into account
any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset and the fair market
value of such asset as of the time of the contribution ("Precontribution
Gain"). Each Partner hereby agrees to report income, gain, loss and deduction
on such Partner's federal income tax return in a manner consistent with the
method used by the Partnership. If any asset has a Gross Asset Value which is
different from the Partnership's adjusted basis for such asset for federal
income tax purposes because the Partnership has revalued such asset pursuant
to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) of the Regulations, the allocations of Tax
Items shall be made in accordance with the principles of Section 704(c) of
the Code and the Regulations and the methods of allocation promulgated
thereunder. The intent of this Section 5.01(f)(iii) is that each Partner who
contributed to the capital of the Partnership a Contributed Property will
bear, through reduced allocations of depreciation, increased allocations of
gain or other items, the tax detriments associated with any Precontribution
Gain. This Section 5.01(f)(iii) is to be interpreted consistently with such
intent.

  



  

(iv) _Excess Nonrecourse Liability Safe Harbor_. Pursuant to Section
1.752-3(a)(3) of the Regulations, solely for purposes of determining each
Partner's proportionate share of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of the
Partnership (as defined in Section 1.752-3(a)(3) of the Regulations), the
Partners' respective interests in Partnership profits shall be
determined under any permissible method reasonably determined by the General
Partner; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Partner who has contributed an
asset to the Partnership shall be allocated, to the extent possible, a share
of "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of the Partnership which results in such
Partner being allocated nonrecourse liabilities in an amount which is at least
equal to the amount of income required to be allocated to such Partner
pursuant to Section 704(c) of the Code and the Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Liability Shortfall"). If there is an
insufficient amount of nonrecourse liabilities to be able to allocate to each
Partner nonrecourse liabilities equal to the Liability Shortfall, nonrecourse
liabilities shall be allocated to each Partner in pro rata in accordance with
each such Partner's Liability Shortfall.

  



  

5.02 _Distribution of Cash_.

  



  

(a) _Cash Available for Distribution_. Subject to the other
provisions of this _Article V_ and to the provisions of _Sections 12.03_, 
_13.03_ , _14.03_ and _15.02(a)_ , the General Partner shall cause the
Partnership to distribute Cash Available for Distribution, at such times and
in such amounts as are, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
determined by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion, to the
Partners who are Partners on the Partnership Record Date with respect to such
quarter (or other distribution period), as follows:

  



   

33 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) _first_ , 100% to the Partners holding Series A Preferred Units
and/or Series B Preferred Units _pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in proportion to
their relative number of Partnership Units until such Partners have received
in the aggregate, pursuant to this _Section 5.02(a)(i)_ and _Section
5.02(b)(i)_ , an amount such that the Series A Preferred Return has been
reduced to zero with respect to each such Series A Preferred Unit and the
Series B Preferred Return has been reduced to zero with respect to each such
Series B Preferred Unit; and

  



  

(ii) _thereafter_ , 100% to the Partners holding OP Units, Manager's
Units and/or Class B Units _pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in proportion to each
such Partner's respective Percentage Interest with respect to such OP Units,
Manager's Units and/or Class B Units.

  



  

(b) _Net Liquidating Proceeds_. Subject to the other provisions of
this _Article V_ and to the provisions of _Sections 12.03_,  _13.03_ ,
_14.03_ and _15.02(a)_ , the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to
distribute Net Liquidating Proceeds, at such times and in such amounts as
are, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, determined by the
General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion, to the Partners who are
Partners on the Partnership Record Date with respect to such quarter (or
other distribution period), as follows:

  



  

(i) _first_ , 100% to the Partners holding Series A Preferred Units
and/or Series B Preferred Units _pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in proportion to
their respective number of Partnership Units until such Partners have received
in the aggregate, pursuant to this  _Section 5.02(b)(i)_ and _Section
5.02(a)(i)_ , an amount such that the Series A Preferred Return has been
reduced to zero with respect to each such Series A Preferred Unit and the
Series B Preferred Return has been reduced to zero with respect to each such
Series B Preferred Unit;

  



  

(ii) _second_ , 100% to the Partners holding Series A Preferred
Units and/or Series B Preferred Units _pro rata_ and _pari passu_
in proportion to their respective number of Partnership Units until such
Partners have received in the aggregate, pursuant to this  _Section
5.1(b)(ii)_ , an amount such that the Series A Liquidation Amount has been
reduced to zero with respect to each such Series A Preferred Unit and the
Series B Liquidation Amount has been reduced to zero with respect to each such
Series B Preferred Unit; and

  



  

(iii) _thereafter_ , 100% among all Partners holding OP Units,
Manager's Units and/or Class B Units _pro rata_ and _pari passu_ in
proportion to each such Partner's respective Percentage Interest; _provided_
, that to the extent the aggregate Economic Capital Account Balance of the
Class B Units is less than the aggregate OP Unit Economic Balance attributable
to all outstanding OP Units, the Percentage Interest of the Partner holding
Class B Units shall be reduced for purposes of determining its proportionate
share of distributions pursuant to this Section 5.02(b)(iii) to equal such
Partner's Percentage Interest multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the aggregate Economic Capital Account Balance, and the denominator
of which is the aggregate OP Unit Economic Balance attributable to all
outstanding OP Units.

(c) If a new or existing Partner acquires additional Partnership
Units in exchange for a Capital Contribution on any date other than
a Partnership Record Date, the cash distribution attributable to such
additional Partnership Units relating to the Partnership Record Date next
following the issuance of such additional Partnership Units shall be reduced
in the proportion to (i) the number of days that such additional Partnership
Units are held by such Partner bears to (ii) the number of days between such
Partnership Record Date and the immediately preceding Partnership Record
Date.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
General Partner is authorized to take any action that it determines to be
necessary or appropriate to cause the Partnership to comply with any
withholding requirements established under the Code or any other
federal, state or local law including, without limitation, pursuant to
Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code. To the extent that the
Partnership is required to withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any
amount with respect to a Partner, either (i) if the actual amount to be
distributed to the Partner (the "Distributable Amount") equals or exceeds the
Withheld Amount, the entire Distributable Amount shall be treated as a
distribution of cash to such Partner, or (ii) if the Distributable Amount is
less than the Withheld Amount, the distributable amount shall be treated as a
distribution of cash to such Partner and the excess of the Withheld Amount
over the Distributable Amount shall be treated as a Partnership Loan from the
Partnership to the Partner on the day the Partnership pays over such amount
to a taxing authority. A Partner shall repay a Partnership Loan upon the
demand of the Partnership or, alternatively, through withholding by the
Partnership with respect to subsequent distributions to the applicable
Partner or assignee. In the event that a Limited Partner fails to pay any
amount owed to the Partnership with respect to the Partnership Loan within 15
days after demand for payment thereof is made by the Partnership on the
Limited Partner, the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion,
may elect to make the payment to the Partnership on behalf of such
Defaulting Limited Partner. In such event, on the date of payment, the
General Partner shall be deemed to have extended a General Partner Loan to
the Defaulting Limited Partner in the amount of the payment made by the
General Partner and the General Partner shall succeed to all rights and
remedies of the Partnership against the Defaulting Limited Partner as to that
amount. Without limitation, the General Partner shall have the right to
receive any distributions that otherwise would be made by the Partnership to
the Defaulting Limited Partner until such time as the General Partner Loan
has been paid in full, and any such distributions so received by the General
Partner shall be treated as having been received by the Defaulting Limited
Partner and immediately paid to the General Partner.

  



  

Any amounts treated as a Partnership Loan or a General Partner Loan pursuant
to this Section 5.02(d) shall bear interest at the lesser of (i) 300 basis
points above the base rate on corporate loans at large United States money
center commercial banks, as published from time to time in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , or (ii) the maximum lawful rate of interest on such obligation,
such interest to accrue from the date the Partnership or the General Partner,
as applicable, is deemed to extend the loan until such loan is repaid in full.

  



   

35 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(e) In no event may a Partner receive a distribution of cash with
respect to a Partnership Unit if such Partner is entitled to receive a cash
dividend as the holder of record of a REIT Share for which all or part of such
Partnership Unit has been or is being redeemed.

  



  

5.03 _REIT Distribution Requirements_. The General Partner shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Partnership to
distribute amounts sufficient to enable the General Partner to pay
distributions to its stockholders that will allow the General Partner to (i)
meet its distribution requirement for qualification as a REIT as set forth in
Section 857 of the Code and (ii) avoid any federal income or excise tax
liability imposed by the Code, other than to the extent the General Partner
elects to retain and pay income tax on its net capital gain.

  



  

5.04 _No Right to Distributions in Kind_. No Partner shall be
entitled to demand property other than cash in connection with
any distributions by the Partnership.

  



  

5.05 _Limitations on Distributions_. Notwithstanding any of the
provisions of this Agreement, no Partner shall have the right to receive, and
the Partnership and the General Partner shall not have the right to make, a
distribution that violates the Act or other applicable law.

  



  

5.06 _Distributions Upon Liquidation_.

  



  

(a) Upon liquidation of the Partnership, after the satisfaction of
all the debts and obligations of the Partnership, to the extent permitted by
law, whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment
thereof, any remaining assets of the Partnership shall be distributed
pursuant to Section 5.02(b). It is the intent of the Partners that
distributions pursuant to the previous sentence reflect the distributions
that would be made to the Partners if such distributions were made to all
Partners with positive Capital Accounts in accordance with their respective
positive Capital Account balances; _provided_ , that to the extent the
distributions pursuant to the prior sentence would not be treated as made to
Partners with positive Capital Accounts in accordance with their respective
positive Capital Accounts, the General Partner, in its sole and absolute
discretion, shall adjust the allocations to be made to the Partners in
accordance with Section 5.01 so that distributions to be made pursuant to this
Section 5.06(a) will be made to Partners with positive Capital Accounts in
accordance with their respective positive Capital Accounts.

  



  

(b) Any distributions pursuant to this Section 5.06 shall be made
within a reasonable time as determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion. To the extent deemed advisable by the General Partner, appropriate
arrangements (including the use of a liquidating trust) may be made to assure
that adequate funds are available to satisfy any contingent debts or
obligations of the Partnership.

(c) If any Partner (other than a holder of Class B Units) has a
deficit balance in his Capital Account (after giving effect to all
contributions, distributions and allocations for all taxable years, including
the year during which such liquidation occurs), such Partner shall have no
obligation to make any contribution to the capital of the Partnership with
respect to such deficit, and such deficit shall not be considered a debt owed
to the Partnership or to any other Person for any purpose whatsoever. If a
holder of Restricted Class B Units has a deficit balance in its Capital
Account attributable to such Class B Units (after giving effect to all
contributions, distributions and allocations for all taxable years, including
the year during with such liquidation occurs), such holder of Class B Units
shall restore and contribute to the capital of the Partnership the amount
necessary to restore such deficit balance to zero, but not to exceed an
amount equal to the excess of the cash distributions of Net Liquidating
Proceeds made (if any) to such holder of Class B Units over the amount of Net
Property Gain (including, to the extent necessary, individual items of income
and gain comprising Net Property Gain) allocated to such holder of Class B
Units in accordance with Section 5.01(c), in compliance with Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( _b_ )( _3_ ) of the Regulations, which restoration and
contribution shall be before the later to occur of (x) the end of the taxable
year in which the Partnership is liquidated, or (y) ninety (90) days after the
date of the liquidation of the Partnership, which amount shall be paid to
creditors of the Partnership or, if the amount contributed exceeds the amount
due to creditors, shall be distributed to the Partners with positive Capital
Account balances.

  



  

5.07 _Substantial Economic Effect_. It is the intent of the Partners
that the allocations of Net Income, Net Loss, Net Property Gain and
Net Property Loss under the Agreement have "substantial economic effect" (or
be consistent with the Partners' interests in the Partnership in the case of
the allocation of losses attributable to nonrecourse debt) within the meaning
of Section 704(b) of the Code as interpreted by the Regulations promulgated
pursuant thereto. Article V and other relevant provisions of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.

(ix) to prosecute, defend, arbitrate or compromise any and all claims

39 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(xxiv) to take such other action, execute, acknowledge, swear to or
deliver such other documents and instruments, and perform any and all other
acts that the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate such that the
General Partner shall continue to satisfy the requirements for qualification
as a REIT under the Code and Regulations ("REIT Requirements") and avoid
any federal income or excise tax liability; _provided_ , _however_ , the
General Partner shall not be bound to comply with this covenant to the extent
any distributions required to be made in order to satisfy the REIT
Requirements would violate the Act or other applicable law or contravene the
terms of any notes, mortgages or other types of debt obligations to which the
Partnership may be subject in conjunction with borrowed funds.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein or in the Act, to the extent
the duties of the General Partner require expenditures of funds to be paid to
third parties, the General Partner shall not have any obligations hereunder
except to the extent that Partnership funds are reasonably available to it
for the performance of such duties, and nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to authorize or require the General Partner, in its capacity as such,
to expend its individual funds for payment to third parties or to
undertake any individual liability or obligation on behalf of the
Partnership.

  



  

6.02 _Delegation of Authority_. The General Partner may delegate any
or all of its powers, rights and obligations hereunder, and may
appoint, employ, contract or otherwise deal with any Person for the
transaction of the business of the Partnership, which Person may,
under supervision of the General Partner, perform any acts or services for
the Partnership as the General Partner may approve.

  



  

6.03 _Indemnification and Exculpation of Indemnitees_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership shall
indemnify an Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts arising from any
and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the
Partnership as set forth in this Agreement in which any Indemnitee may be
involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, unless it
is established that: (i) the act or omission of the Indemnitee was material
to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and either was committed in bad
faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty; (ii) the
Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property
or services; or (iii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the Indemnitee
had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful.
The parties hereto agree, that the termination of any proceeding by judgment,
order or settlement does not create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not
meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in this Section 6.03(a). The
parties hereto agree, that the termination of any proceeding by conviction or
upon a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, or an entry of an
order of probation prior to judgment, creates a rebuttable presumption that
the Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in this Section
6.03(a). Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall be made only
out of the assets of the Partnership.

  



   

40 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) The Partnership shall reimburse an Indemnitee for reasonable
expenses incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party to a proceeding in
advance of the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt by the
Partnership of (i) a written affirmation by the Indemnitee of
the Indemnitee's good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for
indemnification by the Partnership as authorized in this Section 6.03 has
been met, and (ii) a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to
repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of
conduct has not been met.

  



  

(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 6.03 shall be in
addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may
be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a
matter of law or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to serve in such capacity.

  



  

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain insurance, as an
expense of the Partnership, on behalf of the Indemnitees and such
other Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against any liability
that may be asserted against or expenses that may be incurred by such Person
in connection with the Partnership's activities, regardless of whether the
Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such
liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(e) For purposes of this Section 6.03, the Partnership shall be
deemed to have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an
employee benefit plan whenever the performance by it of its duties to the
Partnership also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to
the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed
on an Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to
applicable law shall constitute fines within the meaning of this Section 6.03;
and actions taken or omitted by the Indemnitee with respect to an employee
benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a purpose reasonably
believed by it to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of
the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose that is not opposed to the best
interests of the Partnership.

  



  

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to
personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Agreement.

  



  

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in
part under this Section 6.03 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the
transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(h) The provisions of this Section 6.03 are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall
not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

  



   

41 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.03 or
any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any
way affect the indemnification of an Indemnitee by the Partnership under this
Section 6.03 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification
or repeal with respect to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to
such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when claims relating to
such matters may arise or be asserted.

  



  

6.04 _Liability of the General Partner_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to the
Partnership or any Partners for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a
result of errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or
omission if any such party acted in good faith. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement or otherwise applicable provision of law or equity, the
General Partner shall not be in breach of any duty (fiduciary or otherwise)
that the General Partner may owe to the Limited Partners or the Partnership
or any other Persons bound by this Agreement provided the General Partner,
acting in good faith, abides by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or otherwise
applicable provision of law or equity, the Limited Partners expressly
acknowledge that the General Partner is acting for the benefit of the
Partnership, the Limited Partners and the General Partner's
stockholders collectively, and that, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
the General Partner has no duty (fiduciary or otherwise) and is under no
obligation to consider the separate interests of the Limited Partners
(including, without limitation, the tax consequences to Limited Partners or
the tax consequences of some, but not all, of the Limited Partners) in
deciding whether to cause the Partnership to take (or decline to take) any
actions. In the event of a conflict between the interests of the stockholders
of the General Partner on the one hand and the Limited Partners on the other,
the General Partner shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the conflict in a
manner not adverse to either the stockholders of the General Partner or the
Limited Partners; _provided_ , _however_ , that for so long as the General
Partner owns a controlling interest in the Partnership, any such conflict that
the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines cannot
be resolved in a manner not adverse to either the stockholders of the
General Partner or the Limited Partners shall be resolved in favor of the
stockholders of the General Partner. The General Partner shall not be liable
to the Partners or the Partnership for monetary damages for losses sustained,
liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by the Limited Partners or the
Partnership in connection with such decisions.

  



  

(c) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set
forth in Section 6.01 hereof, the General Partner may exercise any of the
powers granted to it under this Agreement and perform any of the duties
imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents. The
General Partner shall not be responsible or liable to the Limited Partners or
the Partnership for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such
agent appointed by it in good faith.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or the
Act, any action of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or any
decision of the General Partner to refrain from acting on behalf of the
Partnership, undertaken in the good faith belief that such action or omission
is necessary or advisable in order (i) to protect the ability of the General
Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT or (ii) to prevent the General
Partner from incurring any taxes under Section 857, Section 4981 or any other
provision of the Code, is expressly authorized under this Agreement and is
deemed approved by all of the Limited Partners.

  



   

42 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(e) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.04 or
any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any
way affect the limitations on the General Partner's or any of its officer's,
director's, agent's or employee's liability to the Partnership and the
Limited Partners under this Section 6.04 as in effect immediately prior to
such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to matters occurring, in
whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless
of when claims relating to such matters may arise or be asserted.

  



  

6.05 _Partnership Obligations_.

  



  

(a) Except as provided in this Section 6.05 and elsewhere in this
Agreement (including the provisions of Articles V and VI hereof
regarding distributions, payments and allocations to which it may be
entitled), the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services as
general partner of the Partnership.

  



  

(b) All Administrative Expenses shall be obligations of the
Partnership, and the General Partner shall be entitled to reimbursement
by the Partnership for any expenditure (including Administrative Expenses)
incurred on behalf of the Partnership that shall be made other than out of
the funds of the Partnership.

  



  

6.06 _Outside Activities_. Subject to Section 6.08 hereof, the
Charter and any agreements entered into by the General Partner or its
Affiliates with the Partnership or a Subsidiary, any officer, director,
employee, agent, trustee, Affiliate or stockholders of the General Partner
and the General Partner shall be entitled to and may have business interests
and engage in business activities in addition to those relating to the
Partnership, including business interests and activities substantially similar
or identical to those of the Partnership, and the doctrine of corporate
opportunity or any analogous doctrine shall not apply to such business
interest or activities. Neither the Partnership nor any of the Limited
Partners shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement in any such
business ventures, interest or activities. None of the Limited Partners nor
any other Person bound by this Agreement shall have any rights by virtue of
this Agreement or the partnership relationship established hereby in any such
business ventures, interests or activities, and the General Partner, (i)
shall have no duty or obligation (fiduciary or otherwise) pursuant to this
Agreement to offer any interest in any such business ventures, interests and
activities to the Partnership or any Limited Partner, even if such
opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Partnership or any
Limited Partner, could be taken by such Person, and (ii) shall not be liable
to the Partnership or to the Limited Partners for breach of any fiduciary or
other duty existing at law, in equity or otherwise by reason of the fact that
the General Partner pursues or acquires for, or directs such business
ventures, interests or activities to another Person or does not communicate
such opportunity or information to the Partnership.

6.07 _Employment or Retention of Affiliates_.

  



  

(a) Any Affiliate of the General Partner may be employed or retained
by the Partnership and may otherwise deal with the Partnership (whether as a
buyer, lessor, lessee, manager, furnisher of goods or services, broker, agent,
lender or otherwise) and may receive from the Partnership any compensation,
price or other payment therefor that the General Partner determines to be fair
and reasonable.

  



  

(b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to its Subsidiaries or
other Persons in which it has an equity investment, and such Persons may
borrow funds from the Partnership, on terms and conditions established in the
sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner. The foregoing authority
shall not create any right or benefit in favor of any Subsidiary or any other
Person.

  



  

(c) The Partnership may transfer assets to joint ventures, other
partnerships, corporations or other business entities in which it is
or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and subject to such
conditions as the General Partner deems are consistent with this Agreement
and applicable law.

  



  

6.08 _General Partner Activities_. The General Partner agrees that,
generally, all business activities of the General Partner,
including activities pertaining to the acquisition, development, ownership of
or investment in single tenant freestanding commercial real estate and
related assets, shall be conducted through the Partnership or one or more
Subsidiary Partnerships; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, subject to Section
4.02(a)(ii), the General Partner may make direct acquisitions or undertake
business activities if such acquisitions or activities are made in connection
with the issuance of Additional Securities by the General Partner or the
business activity has been approved by a majority of the Independent
Directors.

  



  

6.09 _Title to Partnership Assets_. Title to Partnership assets,
whether real, personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible, shall be
deemed to be owned by the Partnership as an entity, and no Partner,
individually or collectively, shall have any ownership interest in such
Partnership assets or any portion thereof. Title to any or all of the
Partnership assets may be held in the name of the Partnership, the General
Partner or one or more nominees, as the General Partner may determine,
including Affiliates of the General Partner. The General Partner hereby
declares and warrants that any Partnership assets for which legal title is
held in the name of the General Partner or any nominee or Affiliate of the
General Partner shall be held by the General Partner for the use and benefit
of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the General Partner shall use its best efforts
to cause beneficial and record title to such assets to be vested in the
Partnership as soon as reasonably practicable. All Partnership assets shall
be recorded as the property of the Partnership in its books and records,
irrespective of the name in which legal title to such Partnership assets is
held.

  



  

6.10 _Redemption of General Partner 's Partnership Units_. In the
event the General Partner redeems or repurchases any REIT Shares, then the
General Partner shall cause the Partnership to purchase from the General
Partner a number of Partnership Units as determined based on the application
of the Conversion Factor on the same terms that the General Partner redeemed
such REIT Shares. Moreover, if the General Partner makes a cash tender offer
or other offer to acquire REIT Shares, then the General Partner shall cause
the Partnership to make a corresponding offer to the General Partner to
acquire an equal number of Partnership Units held by the General Partner. In
the event any REIT Shares are redeemed or repurchased by the General Partner
pursuant to such offer, the Partnership shall redeem or repurchase an
equivalent number of the General Partner's Partnership Units for an equivalent
purchase price based on the application of the Conversion Factor.

ARTICLE VII _ 
 CHANGES IN GENERAL PARTNER_

  



  

7.01 _Transfer of the General Partner 's Partnership Interest_.

  



  

(a) The General Partner shall not transfer all or any portion of its
General Partner Interests, and the General Partner shall not withdraw as
General Partner, except as provided in or in connection with a transaction
contemplated by Section 7.01(c) hereof.

  



  

(b) The General Partner agrees that its General Partner Interest
will at all times be in the aggregate at least 0.1% of the
Partnership Interests.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.01, the General
Partner may transfer all or any portion of its General Partner Interest to any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the General Partner that is (i) (A) either a state
law corporation or is eligible to make, and has validly made, an election
pursuant to Treas. Regs. Sec. 301.7701-3 to be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (B) a TRS,
or (ii) an entity that is wholly owned by the General Partner and treated as
disregarded for federal income tax purposes, and following a transfer of all
of its General Partner Interest, may withdraw as General Partner. In the
event that the General Partner transfers its entire General Partner Interest
and the transferee is admitted to the Partnership as a substitute General
Partner in accordance with this Agreement, such transferee shall be deemed
admitted to the Partnership as a General Partner immediately prior to the
transfer and such transferee shall continue the business of the Partnership
without dissolution.

  



  

7.02 _Merger of General Partner_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.02(b) or (c) hereof,
the General Partner shall not engage in any merger, consolidation or
other combination with or into another Person or sale of all or substantially
all of its assets (other than in connection with a change in the General
Partner's state of incorporation or organizational form), in each case which
results in a Change of Control of the General Partner (a "Transaction"),
unless at least one of the following conditions is met:

  



  

(i) the consent of a Majority in Interest (other than the Percentage
Interest held by the General Partner or any Subsidiary of the
General Partner) is obtained;

  



   

45 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) as a result of such Transaction, all Limited Partners will
receive, or have the right to receive, for each Partnership Unit held by such
Limited Partners an amount of cash, securities or other property equal in
value to the product of the Conversion Factor and the greatest amount of
cash, securities or other property paid in the Transaction to a holder of one
REIT Share in consideration of one REIT Share, _provided_ , that if, in
connection with such Transaction, a purchase, tender or exchange offer
("Offer") shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of more than
50% of the outstanding REIT Shares, each holder of Partnership Units (other
than the General Partner and any Subsidiary of the General Partner) shall be
given the option to exchange its Partnership Units for the greatest amount of
cash, securities or other property that such Limited Partner would have
received had it (A) exercised its OP Unit Redemption Right pursuant to
Section 8.04 hereof and (B) sold, tendered or exchanged pursuant to the Offer
the REIT Shares received upon exercise of the OP Unit Redemption Right
immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer; or

  



  

(iii) the General Partner is the surviving entity in the Transaction
and either (A) the holders of REIT Shares do not receive cash, securities or
other property in the Transaction or (B) all Limited Partners receive for each
Partnership Unit held by such Limited Partners an amount of cash, securities
or other property (expressed as an amount per REIT Share) that is no less in
value than the product of the Conversion Factor and the greatest amount of
cash, securities or other property (expressed as an amount per REIT
Share) received in the Transaction by any holder of REIT Shares.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 7.02(a) hereof, the General Partner may
merge with or into or consolidate with another entity if immediately after
such merger or consolidation (i) substantially all of the assets of the
successor or surviving entity (the "Survivor"), other than Partnership Units
held by the General Partner, are contributed, directly or indirectly, to the
Partnership as a Capital Contribution in exchange for Partnership Units with
a fair market value equal to the value of the assets so contributed as
determined by the Survivor in good faith and (ii) the Survivor expressly
agrees to assume all obligations of the General Partner
hereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement and without the
consent of any other person, upon such contribution and assumption, (i) for
all purposes of this Agreement, if the General Partner is not the Survivor,
the Survivor, shall be deemed to be the "General Partner" hereunder and shall
be deemed to be admitted as the general partner of the Partnership, upon its
execution of a counterpart to this Agreement, effective simultaneously with
the merger or consolidation, (ii) the Survivor shall continue the business of
the Partnership without dissolution, and (iii) the Survivor shall have the
right and duty to amend this Agreement as set forth in this Section 7.02(b)
or in any other manner, if applicable, to reflect the change in the general
partner of the Partnership. The Survivor shall in good faith arrive at a new
method for the calculation of the Cash Amount, the REIT Shares Amount and
Conversion Factor for a Partnership Unit after any such merger or
consolidation so as to approximate the existing method for such
calculation as closely as reasonably possible. Such calculation shall take
into account, among other things, the kind and amount of securities, cash and
other property that was receivable upon such merger or consolidation by a
holder of REIT Shares or options, warrants or other rights relating thereto,
and which a holder of Partnership Units could have acquired had such
Partnership Units been exchanged immediately prior to such merger or
consolidation. Such amendment to this Agreement shall provide for adjustment
to such method of calculation, which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments provided for with respect to the
Conversion Factor. The Survivor also shall in good faith modify the
definition of REIT Shares and make such amendments to Section 8.04 hereof so
as to approximate the existing rights and obligations set forth in Section
8.04 hereof as closely as reasonably possible. The above provisions of this
Section 7.02(b) shall similarly apply to successive mergers or consolidations
permitted hereunder.

  



   

46

--- 

    



  

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.02, the General Partner may engage
in a transaction required by law or by the rules of any national securities
exchange or over-the-counter interdealer quotation system on which the REIT
Shares are listed or traded.

  



  

7.03 _Admission of a Substitute or Additional General Partner_. A
Person shall be admitted as a substitute or additional General Partner of the
Partnership only if the following terms and conditions are satisfied:

  



  

(a) the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional General
Partner shall have accepted and agreed to be bound by all the terms and
provisions of this Agreement by executing a counterpart hereof, and an
amendment to the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Partnership
evidencing the admission of such Person as a General Partner shall have been
filed with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware;

  



  

(b) if the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional
General Partner is a corporation or a partnership, it shall have provided the
Partnership with evidence satisfactory to counsel for the Partnership of such
Person's authority to become a General Partner and to be bound by the terms
and provisions of this Agreement; and

  



  

(c) counsel for the Partnership shall have rendered an opinion
(relying on such opinions from other counsel as may be necessary) that the
admission of the Person to be admitted as a substitute or additional General
Partner is in conformity with the Act, that none of the actions taken in
connection with the admission of such Person as a substitute or additional
General Partner will cause (i) the Partnership to be classified other than as
a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or (ii) the loss of any Limited
Partner's limited liability.

  



  

7.04 _Effect of Bankruptcy, Withdrawal, Death or Dissolution of
General Partner_.

  



  

(a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to the General
Partner (and its removal pursuant to Section 7.05(a) hereof) or
the withdrawal, removal or dissolution of the General Partner or any other
event that results in the General Partner ceasing to be a general partner of
the Partnership under the Act, the Partnership shall be dissolved and its
affairs wound up unless the business of the Partnership is continued pursuant
to Section 7.04(b) hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any successor to the General Partner by merger or consolidation in
compliance with Section 7.02(b) shall, without further act of any Person, be
the General Partner hereunder, and such merger or consolidation shall not
constitute a transfer for purposes of this Agreement and the Partnership
shall continue without dissolution.

  



   

47 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) Following the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to the
General Partner (and its removal pursuant to Section 7.05(a) hereof) or
the withdrawal, removal or dissolution of the General Partner or any other
event that resulting the General Partner ceasing to be a general partner of
the Partnership under the Act, the Partnership shall not be dissolved or wound
up if the Limited Partners, within 90 days after such occurrence, elect to
continue the business of the Partnership for the balance of the term specified
in Section 2.04 hereof by selecting effective as of such occurrence, subject
to Section 7.03 hereof in writing or vote, a substitute General Partner by
consent of a Majority in Interest. Any substitute General Partner selected by
the Limited Partners in accordance with this Section 7.05(b) and admitted to
the Partnership in accordance with Section 7.03, shall be deemed admitted to
the Partnership effective simultaneously with the occurrence of the event
that caused the General Partner to cease to be a general partner of
the Partnership. If the Limited Partners elect to continue the business of
the Partnership and admit a substitute General Partner, the relationship with
the Partners and of any Person who has acquired an interest of a Partner in
the Partnership shall be governed by this Agreement.

  



  

7.05 _Removal of General Partner_.

  



  

(a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Bankruptcy as to, or the
dissolution of, the General Partner, the General Partner shall be deemed to
be removed automatically. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Limited
Partners may not remove the General Partner, with or without cause.

  



  

(b) If the General Partner has been removed pursuant to this Section
7.05 and the Partnership is continued pursuant to Section 7.04 hereof, the
General Partner shall promptly transfer and assign its General Partner
Interest in the Partnership to the substitute General Partner approved by a
Majority in Interest in accordance with Section 7.04(b) hereof and otherwise
be admitted to the Partnership in accordance with Section 7.03 hereof. At the
time of assignment, the removed General Partner shall be entitled to receive
from the substitute General Partner the fair market value of the General
Partner Interest of such removed General Partner as reduced by any damages
caused to the Partnership by such General Partner. Such fair market value
shall be determined by an appraiser mutually agreed upon by the General
Partner and a Majority in Interest within ten days following the removal of
the General Partner. In the event that the parties are unable to agree upon
an appraiser, the removed General Partner and a Majority in Interest each
shall select an appraiser. Each such appraiser shall complete an appraisal of
the fair market value of the removed General Partner's General Partner
Interest within 30 days of the General Partner's removal, and the fair market
value of the removed General Partner's General Partner Interest shall be the
average of the two appraisals; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the higher
appraisal exceeds the lower appraisal by more than 20% of the amount of the
lower appraisal, the two appraisers, no later than 40 days after the removal
of the General Partner, shall select a third appraiser who shall complete an
appraisal of the fair market value of the removed General Partner's General
Partner Interest no later than 60 days after the removal of the
General Partner. In such case, the fair market value of the removed General
Partner's General Partner Interest shall be the average of the two appraisals
closest in value.

  



  

(c) The General Partner Interest of a removed General Partner,
during the time after default until transfer under Section 7.05(b)
hereof, shall be converted to that of a special Limited Partner; _provided_ ,
_however_ , such removed General Partner shall not have any rights to
participate in the management and affairs of the Partnership, and shall not be
entitled to any portion of the income, expense, profit, gain or loss
allocations or cash distributions allocable or payable, as the case may be, to
the Limited Partners. Instead, such removed General Partner shall receive and
be entitled only to retain distributions or allocations of such items that it
would have been entitled to receive in its capacity as General Partner, until
the transfer is effective pursuant to Section 7.05(b) hereof.

  



   

48

--- 

    



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, for so
long as the General Partner is treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the General Partner shall
not be removed unless (a) the General Partner's economic interest in the
Partnership shall be simultaneously transferred to another entity that is
either (i) not an Affiliate of the General Partner or (ii) a TRS or (b) such
removal would not otherwise result in the Partnership having only one partner
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

  



  

(e) All Partners shall have given and hereby do give such consents,
shall take such actions and shall execute such documents as shall be legally
necessary and sufficient to effect all the foregoing provisions of this
Section 7.05.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII _ 
 RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS_

  



  

8.01 _Management of the Partnership_. The Limited Partners shall not
participate in the management or control of Partnership business nor shall
they transact any business for the Partnership, nor shall they have the power
to sign for or bind the Partnership, such powers being vested solely and
exclusively in the General Partner. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, none of the actions taken by any of the Limited
Partners hereunder shall constitute participation in the control of the
business of the Partnership within the meaning of the Act.

  



  

8.02 _Power of Attorney_. Each Limited Partner hereby irrevocably
appoints the General Partner its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, who may
act for each Limited Partner and in its name, place and stead, and for its use
and benefit, to sign, acknowledge, swear to, deliver, file or record, at the
appropriate public offices, any and all documents, certificates and
instruments as may be deemed necessary or desirable by the General Partner to
carry out fully the provisions of this Agreement and the Act in accordance
with their terms, including duly adapted amendments hereto, which power of
attorney is coupled with an interest and shall survive and not be affected by
the subsequent death, dissolution or legal incapacity of the Limited Partner,
or the transfer by the Limited Partner of any part or all of its Partnership
Interest. This power of attorney may be exercised by such attorney-in-fact for
all Limited Partners (or any of them) by a single signature of the General
Partner acting as attorney-in-fact with or without listing all of the Limited
Partners executing an instrument.

  



  

8.03 _Limitation on Liability of Limited Partners_. No Limited
Partner, in its capacity as such, shall be liable for any debts,
liabilities, contracts or obligations of the Partnership. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or under the Act, a Limited Partner shall be
liable to the Partnership only to make payments of its Capital Contribution,
if any, as and when due hereunder. After its Capital Contribution is fully
paid, no Limited Partner shall, except as otherwise required by the Act or as
otherwise provided for herein, be required to make any further Capital
Contributions or other payments or lend any funds to the Partnership.

8.04 _OP Unit Redemption Right_.

  



  

(a) Subject to Sections 8.04(b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) hereof
and the provisions of any agreements between the Partnership and one or more
Limited Partners with respect to OP Units held by them, each Limited Partner,
shall have the right (the "OP Unit Redemption Right") to require the
Partnership to redeem on a Specified Redemption Date all or a portion of the
OP Units held by such Limited Partner at a redemption price equal to and in
the form of the OP Unit Redemption Amount to be paid by the Partnership,
_provided_ , that such OP Units shall have been outstanding for at least one
year (or such lesser time as determined by the General Partner in its sole
and absolute discretion), which period shall include the period that
Partnership Units that were converted into such OP Units were held, and
subject to any restriction agreed to in writing between the Redeeming
Limited Partner and the General Partner. The OP Unit Redemption Right shall
be exercised pursuant to a Notice of Exercise of Redemption Right in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B delivered to the
Partnership (with a copy to the General Partner) by the Limited Partner who
is exercising the OP Unit Redemption Right (the "Redeeming Limited Partner");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Partnership shall, in its sole and
absolute discretion, have the option to deliver either the Cash Amount or the
REIT Shares Amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Partnership shall not be
obligated to satisfy such OP Unit Redemption Right if the General Partner
elects to purchase the OP Units subject to the Notice of Redemption; and
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that no Limited Partner may deliver more than two
Notices of Redemption during each calendar year. A Limited Partner may not
exercise the OP Unit Redemption Right for less than one thousand (1,000) OP
Units or, if such Limited Partner holds less than one thousand (1,000) OP
Units, all of the OP Units held by such Limited Partner. The Redeeming Limited
Partner shall have no right, with respect to any OP Units so redeemed, to
receive any distribution paid with respect to OP Units if the record date for
such distribution is on or after the Specified Redemption Date.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.04(a) hereof, a
Limited Partner that exercises the OP Unit Redemption Right shall be deemed to
have offered to sell the OP Units described in the Notice of Redemption to
the General Partner, and the General Partner may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, elect to purchase directly and acquire such OP Units by paying to
the Redeeming Limited Partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Shares
Amount, as elected by the General Partner (in its sole and absolute
discretion), on the Specified Redemption Date, whereupon the General Partner
shall acquire the OP Units offered for redemption by the Redeeming Limited
Partner and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner
of such OP Units. If the General Partner shall elect to exercise its right to
purchase OP Units under this Section 8.04(b) with respect to a Notice of
Redemption, it shall so notify the Redeeming Limited Partner within five
business days after the receipt by the General Partner of such Notice of
Redemption.

  



  

In the event the General Partner shall exercise its right to purchase OP
Units with respect to the exercise of a OP Unit Redemption Right, the
Partnership shall have no obligation to pay any amount to the Redeeming
Limited Partner with respect to such Redeeming Limited Partner's exercise of
such OP Unit Redemption Right, and each of the Redeeming Limited Partner, the
Partnership and the General Partner shall treat the transaction between the
General Partner and the Redeeming Limited Partner for federal income tax
purposes as a sale of the Redeeming Limited Partner's OP Units to the General
Partner. Each Redeeming Limited Partner agrees to execute such documents as
the General Partner may reasonably require in connection with the issuance of
REIT Shares upon exercise of the OP Unit Redemption Right.

  



   

50 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.04(a) and 8.04(b)
hereof, a Limited Partner shall not be entitled to exercise the OP Unit
Redemption Right if the delivery of REIT Shares to such Limited Partner on
the Specified Redemption Date by the General Partner pursuant to Section
8.04(b) hereof (regardless of whether or not the General Partner would in fact
exercise its rights under Section 8.04(b) hereof) would (i) result in such
Limited Partner or any other Person owning, directly or indirectly, REIT
Shares in excess of the Aggregate Share Ownership Limit or any Excepted
Holder Limit (each as defined in Charter) and calculated in accordance
therewith, except as provided in the Charter, (ii) result in REIT Shares
being owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any
rules of attribution), (iii) result in the General Partner being "closely
held" within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code, (iv) cause the
General Partner to own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the
ownership interests in a tenant (other than a TRS) of the General Partner's,
the Partnership's or a Subsidiary Partnership's real property, within the
meaning of Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code, (v) otherwise cause the General
Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code, or (vi) cause the
acquisition of REIT Shares by such Limited Partner to be "integrated" with any
other distribution of REIT Shares or OP Units for purposes of complying with
the registration provisions of the Securities Act. The General Partner, in
its sole and absolute discretion and without the consent of any other Partner
or Person, may waive the restriction on redemption set forth in this Section
8.04(c).

  



  

(d) Any Cash Amount to be paid to a Redeeming Limited Partner
pursuant to this Section 8.04 shall be paid on the Specified Redemption
Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the General Partner may elect to cause
the Specified Redemption Date to be delayed for up to an additional 90 days
to the extent required for the General Partner to cause additional REIT Shares
to be issued to provide financing to be used to make such payment of the Cash
Amount. Any REIT Share Amount to be paid to a Redeeming Limited Partner
pursuant to this Section 8.04 shall be paid on the Specified Redemption Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the General Partner may elect to cause the
Specified Redemption Date to be delayed for up to an additional 60 days to the
extent required for the General Partner to cause additional REIT Shares to be
issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partner agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the acquisition of redeemed
OP Units hereunder to occur as quickly as reasonably possible.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
General Partner is authorized to take any action that it determines to be
necessary or appropriate to cause the Partnership to comply with any
withholding requirements established under the Code or any other
federal, state or local law that apply upon a Redeeming Limited Partner's
exercise of the OP Unit Redemption Right. If a Redeeming Limited Partner
believes that it is exempt from such withholding upon the exercise of the OP
Unit Redemption Right, such Partner must furnish the General Partner with a
FIRPTA Certificate in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-1 or
Exhibit C-2 and any other documentation reasonably requested by the General
Partner. If the Partnership or the General Partner is required to withhold
and pay over to any taxing authority any amount upon a Redeeming Limited
Partner's exercise of the OP Unit Redemption Right and if the OP Unit
Redemption Amount equals or exceeds the Withheld Amount, the Withheld Amount
shall be treated as an amount received by such Partner in redemption of its
OP Units. If, however, the OP Unit Redemption Amount is less than the Withheld
Amount, the Redeeming Limited Partner shall not receive any portion of the OP
Unit Redemption Amount, the OP Unit Redemption Amount shall be treated as an
amount received by such Partner in redemption of its OP Units, and the Partner
shall contribute the excess of the Withheld Amount over the OP Unit
Redemption Amount to the Partnership before the Partnership is required to pay
over such excess to a taxing authority.

  



   

51 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
General Partner shall place appropriate restrictions on the ability of the
Limited Partners to exercise their OP Unit Redemption Rights as and if deemed
necessary to ensure that the Partnership does not constitute a
"publicly traded partnership" under Section 7704 of the Code. If and when the
General Partner determines that imposing such restrictions is necessary, the
General Partner shall give prompt written notice thereof (a "Restriction
Notice") to each of the Limited Partners, which notice shall be accompanied
by a copy of an opinion of counsel to the Partnership that states that, in
the opinion of such counsel, restrictions are desirable in order to avoid the
Partnership being treated as a "publicly traded partnership" under Section
7704 of the Code.

  



  

8.05 _Registration_. Subject to the terms of any agreement between
the General Partner and a Limited Partner with respect to OP Units held by
such Limited Partner that includes provisions relating to registration rights
(each a "Separate Registration Rights Agreement"):

  



  

(a) _Shelf Registration of the REIT Shares_. Following the date on
which the General Partner becomes eligible to use a registration statement on
Form S-3 for the registration of securities under the Securities Act (the "S-3
Eligible Date") and within the time period that may be agreed by the General
Partner and a Limited Partner, the General Partner shall file with the
Commission a shelf registration statement under Rule 415 of the Securities
Act (a "Registration Statement"), or any similar rule that may be adopted by
the Commission, covering (i) the issuance of REIT Shares issuable upon
redemption of the OP Units held by such Limited Partner ("Redemption Shares")
and/or (ii) the resale by the holder of the Redemption Shares, with respect
to OP Units issued prior to the S-3 Eligible Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the General Partner shall be required to file only two such
registrations in any 12-month period. In connection therewith, the General
Partner will:

  



  

(1) use its reasonable best efforts to have such Registration
Statement declared effective;

  



  

(2) furnish to each holder of Redemption Shares such number of copies
of prospectuses, and supplements or amendments thereto, and such
other documents as such holder reasonably requests;

  



  

(3) register or qualify the Redemption Shares covered by the
Registration Statement under the securities or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions within the United States as any holder of Redemption Shares
shall reasonably request, and do such other reasonable acts and things as may
be required of it to enable such holders to consummate the sale or other
disposition in such jurisdictions of the Redemption Shares; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the General Partner shall not be required to (i) qualify as a
foreign corporation or consent to a general or unlimited service or process
in any jurisdictions in which it would not otherwise be required to
be qualified or so consent or (ii) qualify as a dealer in securities; and

  



   

52 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(4) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission.

  



  

The General Partner further agrees to supplement or make amendments to each
Registration Statement, if required by the rules, regulations or instructions
applicable to the registration form utilized by the General Partner or by the
Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder for such Registration
Statement. Each Limited Partner agrees to furnish to the General Partner,
upon request, such information with respect to the Limited Partner as may be
required to complete and file the Registration Statement.

  



  

In connection with and as a condition to the General Partner's obligations
with respect to the filing of a Registration Statement pursuant to this
Section 8.05, each Limited Partner agrees with the General Partner that:

  



  

(x) it will not offer or sell its Redemption Shares until (A) such
Redemption Shares have been included in a Registration Statement and (B) it
has received copies of a prospectus, and any supplement or amendment thereto,
as contemplated by Section 8.05(a) hereof, and receives notice that the
Registration Statement covering such Redemption Shares, or any post-effective
amendment thereto, has been declared effective by the Commission;

  



  

(y) if the General Partner determines in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with counsel, that the use of the Registration
Statement, including any post effective amendment thereto, or the use of any
prospectus contained in such Registration Statement would require the
disclosure of important information that the General Partner has a _bona fide_
business purpose for preserving as confidential or the disclosure of which
would impede the General Partner's ability to consummate a significant
transaction, upon written notice of such determination by the General
Partner, the rights of each Limited Partner to offer, sell or distribute its
Redemption Shares pursuant to such Registration Statement or prospectus or to
require the General Partner to take action with respect to the registration
or sale of any Redemption Shares pursuant to a Registration Statement
(including any action contemplated by this Section 8.05) will be suspended
until the date upon which the General Partner notifies such Limited Partner in
writing (which notice shall be deemed sufficient if given through the
issuance of a press release) that suspension of such rights for the grounds
set forth in this paragraph is no longer necessary; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the General Partner may not suspend such rights for an aggregate period
of more than 90 days in any 12-month period; and

  



   

53 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(z) in the case of the registration of any underwritten equity
offering proposed by the General Partner (other than any registration by the
General Partner on Form S-8, or a successor or substantially similar form, of
(A) an employee share option, share purchase or compensation plan or of
securities issued or issuable pursuant to any such plan or (B) a dividend
reinvestment plan), each Limited Partner will agree, if requested in writing
by the managing underwriter or underwriters administering such offering, not
to effect any offer, sale or distribution of any REIT Shares or Redemption
Shares (or any option or right to acquire REIT Shares or Redemption Shares)
during the period commencing on the tenth day prior to the expected effective
date (which date shall be stated in such notice) of the registration
statement covering such underwritten primary equity offering or, if such
offering shall be a "take-down" from an effective shelf registration
statement, the tenth day prior to the expected commencement date (which date
shall be stated in such notice) of such offering, and ending on the date
specified by such managing underwriter in such written request to the Limited
Partners; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Limited Partner shall be required
to agree not to effect any offer, sale or distribution of its Redemption
Shares for a period of time that is longer than the greater of 90 days or the
period of time for which any senior executive of the General Partner is
required so to agree in connection with such offering. Nothing in this
paragraph shall be read to limit the ability of any Limited Partner to redeem
its OP Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Listing on Securities Exchange_. If the General Partner lists
or maintains the listing of REIT Shares on any securities exchange
or national market system, it shall, at its expense and as necessary to
permit the registration and sale of the Redemption Shares hereunder, list
thereon, maintain and, when necessary, increase such listing to include such
Redemption Shares.

  



  

(c) _Registration Not Required_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
General Partner shall not be required to file or maintain the
effectiveness of a registration statement relating to Redemption Shares after
the first date upon which, in the opinion of counsel to the General Partner,
all of the Redemption Shares covered thereby could be sold by the holders
thereof pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or any successor rule
thereto.

  



  

(d) _Allocation of Expenses_. The Partnership shall pay all
expenses in connection with the Registration Statement, including without
limitation (i) all expenses incident to filing with the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc., (ii) registration fees, (iii) printing expenses,
(iv) accounting and legal fees and expenses, except to the extent holders of
Redemption Shares elect to engage accountants or attorneys in addition to the
accountants and attorneys engaged by the General Partner or the Partnership,
which fees and expenses for such accountants or attorneys shall be for the
account of the holders of the Redemption Shares, (v) accounting expenses
incident to or required by any such registration or qualification and (vi)
expenses of complying with the securities or blue sky laws of any
jurisdictions in connection with such registration or qualification;
_provided_ , _however_ , neither the Partnership nor the General Partner
shall be liable for (A) any discounts or commissions to any underwriter or
broker attributable to the sale of Redemption Shares, or (B) any fees or
expenses incurred by holders of Redemption Shares in connection with such
registration that, according to the written instructions of any regulatory
authority, the Partnership or the General Partner is not permitted to pay.

(e) _Indemnification_.

  



  

(i) In connection with the Registration Statement, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the General Partner and the Partnership agree to
indemnify holders of Redemption Shares within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act, against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable costs of investigation) caused by any untrue, or alleged
untrue, statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement,
preliminary prospectus or prospectus (as amended or supplemented if
the General Partner shall have furnished any amendments or supplements
thereto) or caused by any omission or alleged omission, to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses are caused by any untrue statement, alleged
untrue statement, omission, or alleged omission based upon information
furnished to the General Partner by the Limited Partner or the holder of
Redemption Shares for use therein. The General Partner and each officer,
director and controlling Person of the General Partner and the
Partnership shall be indemnified by each Limited Partner or holder of
Redemption Shares covered by the Registration Statement for all such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of
investigation) caused by any untrue, or alleged untrue, statement or any
omission, or alleged omission, based upon information furnished to the General
Partner or the Partnership by the Limited Partner or the holder for use
therein.

  



  

(ii) Promptly upon receipt by a party indemnified under this Section
8.05(e) of notice of the commencement of any action against such
indemnified party in respect of which indemnity or reimbursement may be
sought against any indemnifying party under this Section 8.05(e),
such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement of such action, but the failure to so notify the indemnifying
party shall not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any
indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8.05(e) unless such
failure shall materially adversely affect the defense of such action. In case
notice of commencement of any such action shall be given to the indemnifying
party as above provided, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate in and, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action
at its own expense, with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to
such indemnified party. The indemnified party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof,
but the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel (other than reasonable
costs of investigation) shall be paid by the indemnified party unless (i)
the indemnifying party agrees to pay the same, (ii) the indemnifying party
fails to assume the defense of such action with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such
action (including any impleaded parties) have been advised by such counsel
that representation of such indemnified party and the indemnifying party by
the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct (in which case the indemnified party shall have the
right to separate counsel and the indemnifying party shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of such separate counsel, _provided_ , that the
indemnifying party shall not be liable for more than one separate counsel). No
indemnifying party shall be liable to any indemnified party for any
settlement entered into without its consent.

  



   

55

(f) _Contribution_.

  



  

(i) If for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by
Section 8.05(e) hereof are either unavailable or insufficient to hold
harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities referred to therein, then the party that would otherwise be
required to provide indemnification or the indemnifying party (in either case,
for purposes of this Section 8.05(f), the "Indemnifying Party") in respect of
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by the party that would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification or the indemnified party (in either case, for purposes of
this Section 8.05(f), the "Indemnified Party") as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expense, in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact related to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or
Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed
to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such
party.

  



  

(ii) The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this Section 8.05(f) were determined by pro rata
allocation (even if the holders were treated as one entity for such purpose)
or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
No Person determined to have committed a fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

  



  

(iii) The contribution provided for in this Section 8.05(f) shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Party.

  



  

(g) _Conflict_. With respect to any Limited Partner, in the event
of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 8.05 and any Separate
Registration Rights Agreement, the provisions of the Separate Registration
Rights Agreement shall control.

56 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.02 hereof, each Limited
Partner agrees that such Limited Partner will not Transfer such
Limited Partner's Partnership Units or any fraction thereof, whether
voluntarily or by operation of law or at judicial sale or otherwise, to any
Person who does not make the representations and warranties to the General
Partner set forth in Section 9.01(a) hereof.

  



  

9.02 _Restrictions on Transfer of Partnership Units_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the provisions of Sections 9.02(b), (c) and (d)
hereof, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no Limited Partner may
offer, sell, assign, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise transfer all or any
portion of such Limited Partner's Partnership Units, or any of such Limited
Partner's economic rights as a Limited Partner, whether voluntarily or by
operation of law or at judicial sale or otherwise (collectively, a
"Transfer") without the consent of the General Partner, which consent may be
granted or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion. The General Partner
may require, as a condition of any Transfer to which it consents, that the
transferor assume all costs incurred by the Partnership in connection
therewith.

  



  

(b) No Limited Partner may withdraw from the Partnership other than
as a result of a permitted Transfer ( _i.e._ , a Transfer consented to as
contemplated by clause (a) above or clause (c) below or a Transfer pursuant to
Section 9.05 hereof) of all of such Limited Partner's Partnership Units
pursuant to this Article IX or pursuant to a redemption of all of such Limited
Partner's OP Units pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof. Upon the permitted
Transfer or redemption of all of a Limited Partner's OP Units, such Limited
Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner.

  



  

(c) Subject to Sections 9.02(d), (e) and (f) hereof, a Limited
Partner may Transfer, with the consent of the General Partner, all or a
portion of such Limited Partner's Partnership Units to such Limited Partner's
(i) parent or parent's spouse, (ii) spouse, (iii) natural or adopted
descendant or descendants, (iv) spouse of such Limited Partner's descendant,
(v) brother or sister, (vi) trust created by such Limited Partner for the
primary benefit of such Limited Partner and/or any such Person(s)
described in (i) through (v) above, of which trust such Limited Partner or
any such Person(s) or bank or other commercial entity in the business of
acting as a fiduciary in its ordinary course of business and having an equity
capitalization of at least $100,000,000 is a trustee, (vii) a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company controlled by a Person or Persons
named in (i) through (v) above, or (viii) if the Limited Partner is an
entity, its beneficial owners.

  



  

(d) No Limited Partner may effect a Transfer of its Partnership
Units, in whole or in part, if, in the opinion of legal counsel for
the Partnership, such proposed Transfer would require the registration of the
Partnership Units under the Securities Act or would otherwise violate any
applicable federal or state securities or blue sky law (including investment
suitability standards).

  



   

57 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(e) No Transfer by a Limited Partner of its Partnership Units, in
whole or in part, may be made to any Person if the General Partner
determines, in its commercially reasonable discretion, that (i) such Transfer
would result in the Partnership being treated as an association taxable as a
corporation (other than a qualified REIT subsidiary within the meaning of
Section 856(i) of the Code), (ii) it would adversely affect the ability of
the General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT or subject the General
Partner to any additional taxes under Section 857, Section 4981 or any other
provision of the Code or (iii) such Transfer is effectuated through an
"established securities market" or a "secondary market (or the substantial
equivalent thereof)" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code;
_provided_ , that if the General Partner secures an opinion of qualified
United States tax counsel that the Partnership would, if such Transfer were
completed, satisfy one or more provisions under Section 7704 of the Code and
the Regulations promulgated thereunder such that the Partnership would not be
treated as a "publicly traded partnership" for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, then such Transfer shall not be prohibited by this Section 9.02(e).

  



  

(f) To the fullest extent permitted by law, any purported Transfer
in contravention of any of the provisions of this Article IX shall be void
_ab initio_ and ineffectual and shall not be binding upon, or recognized by,
the General Partner or the Partnership.

  



  

(g) Prior to the consummation of any Transfer under this Article IX,
the transferor and/or the transferee shall deliver to the General
Partner such opinions, certificates and other documents as the General
Partner shall request in connection with such Transfer.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 9.02, ARC Real Estate Partners, LLC may Transfer any of its OP Units
to its Members (as defined in the limited liability company agreement of ARC
Real Estate Partners, LLC, dated July 26, 2010, by and among the signatories
thereto, as amended from time to time), without the consent of the General
Partner.

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article IX, an assignee
of the Partnership Units of a Limited Partner (which shall be understood to
include any purchaser, transferee, donee or other recipient of any disposition
of such Partnership Units) shall be deemed admitted as a Limited Partner of
the Partnership only with the consent of the General Partner, which consent

discretion, and upon the satisfactory completion of the following:

  



  

(i) The assignee shall have accepted and agreed to be bound by the

representation set forth in Section 9.01(a) hereof and the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 9.01(b) hereof.

assignee shall have provided the General Partner with evidence
satisfactory to counsel for the Partnership of the assignee's authority to
become a Limited Partner under the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(iv) The assignee shall have executed a power of attorney containing
the terms and provisions set forth in Section 8.02 hereof.

  



  

(v) The assignee shall have paid all legal fees and other expenses of
the Partnership and the General Partner and filing and publication costs in
connection with its substitution as a Limited Partner.

  



  

(vi) The assignee shall have obtained the prior written consent of the
General Partner to its admission as a Substitute Limited Partner, which
consent may be given or denied in the exercise of the General Partner's sole
and absolute discretion.

  



  

(b) For the purpose of allocating Net Income and Net Loss and
distributing cash received by the Partnership, a Substitute Limited
Partner shall be treated as having become, and appearing in the records of
the Partnership as, a Limited Partner on the later of the date specified in
the transfer documents or the date on which the General Partner has received
all necessary instruments of transfer and substitution.

  



  

(c) The General Partner and the Substitute Limited Partner shall
cooperate with each other by preparing the documentation required by
this Section 9.03 and making all official filings and publications. The
Partnership shall take all such action as promptly as practicable after the
satisfaction of the conditions in this Article IX to the admission of such
Person as a Limited Partner of the Partnership.

  



  

9.04 _Rights of Assignees of Partnership Units_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the provisions of Sections 9.01 and 9.02 hereof,
except as required by operation of law, the Partnership shall not be
obligated for any purposes whatsoever to recognize the assignment by any
Limited Partner of its Partnership Units until the Partnership has received
notice thereof.

  



  

(b) Any Person who is the assignee of all or any portion of a
Limited Partner's Partnership Units, but does not become a Substitute Limited
Partner and desires to make a further assignment of such Partnership Units,
shall be subject to all the provisions of this Article IX to the same extent
and in the same manner as any Limited Partner desiring to make an assignment
of its Partnership Units.

  



  

9.05 _Effect of Bankruptcy, Death, Incompetence or Termination of a
Limited Partner_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the occurrence of
an Event of Bankruptcy as to a Limited Partner, the death of a Limited Partner
or a final adjudication that a Limited Partner is incompetent (which term
shall include, but not be limited to, insanity) shall not, in and of itself,
cause the termination or dissolution of the Partnership, and the business of
the Partnership shall continue, and such Limited Partner's personal
representative (as defined in the Act) shall have the rights of such Limited
Partner for the purpose of settling or managing such Limited Partner's estate
property and such power as the bankrupt, deceased or incompetent Limited
Partner possessed to assign all or any part of such Limited Partner's
Partnership Units and to join with the assignee in satisfying conditions
precedent to the admission of the assignee as a Substitute Limited Partner.

9.06 _Joint Ownership of Partnership Units_. A Partnership Unit may
be acquired by two individuals as joint tenants with right of survivorship, 
_provided_ , that such individuals either are married or are related and share
the same home as tenants in common. The written consent or vote of both
owners of any such jointly held Partnership Unit shall be required to
constitute the action of the owners of such Partnership Unit; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the written consent of only one joint owner will be required
if the Partnership has been provided with evidence satisfactory to the
counsel for the Partnership that the actions of a single joint owner can bind
both owners under the applicable laws of the state of residence of such joint
owners. Upon the death of one owner of a Partnership Unit held in a joint
tenancy with a right of survivorship, the Partnership Unit shall become owned
solely by the survivor as a Limited Partner and not as an assignee. The
Partnership need not recognize the death of one of the owners of a jointly-
held Partnership Unit until it shall have received notice of such death. Upon
notice to the General Partner from either owner, the General Partner shall
cause the Partnership Unit to be divided into two equal Partnership Units,
which shall thereafter be owned separately by each of the former owners.

ordinary business hours.

right to retain professional assistance in respect of any audit of the
Partnership by the Service and all out-of-pocket expenses and fees incurred
by the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership as Tax Matters Partner
shall constitute Partnership expenses. In the event the General Partner
receives notice of a final Partnership adjustment under Section 6223(a)(2) of
the Code, the General Partner shall either (i) file a court petition for
judicial review of such final adjustment within the period provided under
Section 6226(a) of the Code, a copy of which petition shall be mailed to all
Limited Partners on the date such petition is filed, or (ii) mail a written
notice to all Limited Partners, within such period, that describes the General
Partner's reasons for determining not to file such a petition.

Interest of any Partner, the Partnership, at the option of the
General Partner, may elect pursuant to Section 754 of the Code to adjust the
basis of the Properties. Notwithstanding anything contained in Article V of
this Agreement, any adjustments made pursuant to Section 754 shall affect only
the successor in interest to the transferring Partner and in no event shall
be taken into account in establishing, maintaining or computing Capital
Accounts for the other Partners for any purpose under this Agreement unless
an adjustment to Capital Accounts is permitted under the
Regulations promulgated under Section 704 of the Code. Each Partner will
furnish the Partnership with all information necessary to give effect to such
election.

(e) The Partners, intending to be legally bound, hereby authorize
the Partnership to make an election (the "Safe Harbor Election") to have the
"liquidation value" safe harbor provided in Proposed Treasury Regulation §
1.83-3(1) and the Proposed Revenue Procedure set forth in Internal Revenue
Service Notice 2005-43, as such safe harbor may be modified when
such proposed guidance is issued in final form or as amended by subsequently
issued guidance (the "Safe Harbor"), apply to any interest in the Partnership
transferred to a service provider while the Safe Harbor Election remains
effective, to the extent such interest meets the Safe Harbor requirements
(collectively, such interests are referred to as "Safe Harbor Interests").
The Tax Matters Partner is authorized and directed to execute and file the
Safe Harbor Election on behalf of the Partnership and the Partners. The
Partnership and the Partners (including any Person to whom an interest in the
Partnership is transferred in connection with the performance of services)
hereby agree to comply with all requirements of the Safe Harbor (including
forfeiture allocations) with respect to all Safe Harbor Interests and to
prepare and file all U.S. federal income tax returns reporting the tax
consequences of the issuance and vesting of Safe Harbor Interests consistent

Harbor referred to above would be intended to achieve under Proposed Treasury
Regulation § 1.83-3, including amending this Agreement.

ARTICLE XII _ 
 MANAGER 'S UNITS_

  



  

12.01 _Designation and Number_. A series of Partnership Units in the
Partnership, designated as the "Manager's Units," is hereby established. The
number of Manager's Units shall be 10,000,000. Except as set forth in this
Article XII, Manager's Units shall have the same rights, privileges and
preferences as the OP Units.

  



  

12.02 _Voting_. Each Manager's Unit shall entitle the holder thereof
to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of
Partnership Units.

  



  

12.03 _Distributions_. If and when any distributions are paid on OP
Units, the holders of the outstanding Manager's Units shall be entitled to
receive a distribution on each outstanding Manager's Unit in an amount equal
to the product of (A) the per Unit amount of such distribution paid on the OP
Units and (B) 0.01, and such distribution shall be paid when the distribution
is paid on the OP Units (the "Concurrent Distribution"). At such time that
the Partnership covers the payment of distributions on OP Units, that
correspond with the General Partner's cash dividends declared in respect of
the REIT Shares, for the six immediately preceding months from the funds from
operations (as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trusts from time to time), as determined for the General Partner, adjusted to
exclude acquisition-related fees and expenses (the "Distribution Triggering
Event"), to the extent any Manager's Units remain outstanding, no
distributions shall be authorized or paid or set apart for payment on the OP
Units until the holders of the Manager's Units then outstanding have received
distributions equal to the amount per Manager's Unit equal to the cash
distributions that were paid on each OP Unit (not including the amount of
Concurrent Distributions that were paid per Manager's Unit), that were not
paid on such Manager's Unit prior to the Distribution Triggering Event, during
the period in which such Manager's Unit and the OP Units were outstanding.

12.04 _Automatic Unit Conversion_.

  



  

(a) At such times as there occurs a conversion of Manager's REIT
Shares for REIT Shares, a corresponding amount of Manager's Units shall
automatically convert into OP Units, on a one-to-one basis (subject to
appropriate adjustment in the event of any dividend, split, combination or
other similar recapitalization with respect to the OP Units); _provided_ ,
_however_ , to the extent any Manager's Units remain subject to further
vesting requirements, such vesting requirements shall apply to the OP
Units into which such Manager's Units were converted.

  



  

(b) Each automatic conversion of Manager's Units for OP Units shall
be deemed to have been effected at such time as the concurrent conversion of
the corresponding Manager's REIT Shares for REIT Shares shall have been deemed
effected in accordance with the Charter and _Exhibit A_ hereto shall be
amended by the General Partner to reflect such conversion; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the holder of the certificates representing such Manager's
Units, if any, hereby agrees to surrender such certificates representing such
Manager's Units, if any, to the Partnership, and the Person or Persons in
whose name or names any certificate or certificates for OP Units shall be
issuable upon such automatic conversion shall be deemed to have become the
holder or holders of record of the OP Units represented thereby at such time
and on such date. As promptly as practicable after the surrender of such
certificates, if any, representing the Manager's Units, the Partnership shall
issue and shall deliver at such office to such holder, or on his or her
written order, a certificate or certificates, if any, for the number of OP
Units issuable upon the automatic conversion of such Manager's Units in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.04(b); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the failure to surrender the certificates representing the
Manager's Units as provided in this Section 12.04(b) shall not preclude the
automatic conversion of such Manager's Units into OP Units.

  



  

12.05 _Forfeiture of Manager 's Units_. If any Manager's REIT Shares
are forfeited pursuant to an award agreement relating to such Manager's REIT
Shares, an equal number of Manager's Units shall be forfeited by the holder(s)
thereof (and the portion of the holder(s)' Capital Account attributable to
such forfeited Manager's Units also shall be forfeited).

ARTICLE XV _ 
 CLASS B UNITS_

  



  

15.01 _Designation and Number_.

  



  

(a) A series of Partnership Units in the Partnership, designated as
the "Class B Units," is hereby established. Except as set forth in this
Article 15, Class B Units shall have the same rights, privileges and
preferences as the OP Units. The number of Class B Units shall be [l] units
Subject to the provisions of this Article XV and the special provisions of
Section 5.01(c), Class B Units shall be treated as Partnership Units, with all
of the rights, privileges and obligations attendant thereto.

  



  

(b) It is intended that the Partnership shall maintain at all times
a one-to-one correspondence between Class B Units and OP Units for conversion
and other purposes. If an Adjustment Event (as defined below) occurs, then the
General Partner shall make a corresponding adjustment to the Class B Units to
maintain a one-for-one conversion and economic equivalence ratio between OP
Units and Class B Units. The following shall be "Adjustment Events:" (A) the
Partnership makes a distribution on all outstanding OP Units in Partnership
Units, (B) the Partnership subdivides the outstanding OP Units into a greater
number of units or combines the outstanding OP Units into a smaller number of
units, or (C) the Partnership issues any Partnership Units in exchange for
its outstanding OP Units by way of a reclassification or recapitalization of
its OP Units. If more than one Adjustment Event occurs, the adjustment to the
Class B Units need be made only once using a single formula that takes into
account each and every Adjustment Event as if all Adjustment Events occurred
simultaneously. For the avoidance of doubt, the following events shall not be
Adjustment Events: (x) the issuance of Partnership Units in a financing,
reorganization, acquisition or other similar business transaction, (y) the
issuance of Partnership Units pursuant to any employee benefit or compensation
plan or distribution reinvestment plan, or (z) the issuance of any
Partnership Units in respect of a capital contribution to the Partnership,
including a contribution by the General Partner of proceeds from the sale of
securities by the General Partner. If the Partnership takes an action
affecting the OP Units other than actions specifically described above as
Adjustment Events and, in the opinion of the General Partner such action
would require an adjustment to the Class B Units to maintain the one-to-one
correspondence described above, the General Partner shall have the right to
make such adjustment to the Class B Units, to the extent permitted by law, in
such manner and at such time as the General Partner, in its sole discretion,
may determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. If an adjustment is
made to the Class B Units as herein provided, the Partnership shall promptly
file in the books and records of the Partnership an officer's certificate
setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts requiring
such adjustment, which certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the
correctness of such adjustment absent manifest error. Promptly after the
filing of such certificate, the Partnership shall mail a notice to each
holder of Class B Units setting forth the adjustment to his, her or its Class
B Units and the effective date of such adjustment.

15.02 _Special Provisions_. Class B Units shall be subject to the
following special provisions:

  



  

(a) _Distributions_. The holders of Class B Units shall be entitled
to (i) current distributions of Cash Available for Distribution pursuant to
Section 5.02(a)(ii), (ii) distributions, if any, of Net Liquidating Proceeds
pursuant to Section 5.02(b)(iii), and (iii) distributions in liquidation of
the Partnership pursuant to Section 5.06.

  



  

(b) _Allocations_. Holders of Class B Units shall be entitled to
certain special allocations of Net Property Gain under Section 5.01(c).

  



  

(c) _Redemption_. The OP Unit Redemption Right provided to Limited
Partners under Section 8.04 hereof shall not apply with respect to Class B
Units unless and until the Class B Units are converted to OP Units as provided
in Section 15.04.

  



  

15.03 _Voting_.

  



  

(a) Holders of Class B Units shall (x) have the same voting rights
as the Limited Partners, with the Class B Units voting as a single class with
the OP Units and having one vote per Class B Unit; and (y) have the additional
voting rights that are expressly set forth below. So long as any Class B
Units remain outstanding, the Partnership shall not, without the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Class B Units outstanding
at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a
meeting (voting separately as a class), amend, alter or repeal, whether by
merger, consolidation or otherwise, the provisions of this
Agreement applicable to Class B Units so as to materially and adversely
affect any right, privilege or voting power of the Class B Units or the
holders of Class B Units as such, unless such amendment, alteration, or repeal
affects equally, ratably and proportionately the rights, privileges and
voting powers of the Limited Partners; but subject, in any event, to the
following provisions:

  



  

(i) With respect to any OP Unit Transaction, so long as the Class B
Units are treated in accordance with Section 15.04(d) hereof,
the consummation of such OP Unit Transaction shall not be deemed to
materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or
voting powers of the Class B Units or the holders of Class B Units as such;
and

  



   

69 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) Any creation or issuance of any Partnership Units or of any
class or series of Partnership Interest including additional OP Units
or Class B Units whether ranking senior to, junior to, or on a parity with
the Class B Units with respect to distributions and the distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to
materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or
voting powers of the Class B Units or the holders of Class B Units as such.

  



  

(b) The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior
to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be
required, all outstanding Class B Units shall have been converted into OP
Units.

  



  

15.04 _Conversion of Class B Units_.

  



  

(a) _Conversion_. At such time as the Economic Capital Account
Balance attributable to a Class B Unit is equal to the OP Unit Economic
Balance, each such balance determined on a per unit basis as of the effective
date of conversion (the "Conversion Date"), such Class B Unit shall
automatically convert into one fully paid and non-assessable OP Unit, giving
effect to all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to Section 15.01 hereof;
_provided_ , that a Class B Unit shall not be convertible into OP Units if
the Economic Capital Account Balance attributable to such Class B Unit is
negative. Each holder of Class B Units covenants and agrees with the
Partnership that all Class B Units to be converted pursuant to this Section
15.04 shall be free and clear of all liens. The conversion of Class B Units
shall occur automatically after the close of business on the applicable
Conversion Date without any action on the part of such holder of Class B
Units, as of which time such holder of Class B Units shall be credited on the
books and records of the Partnership with the issuance as of the opening of
business on the next day of the number of OP Units issuable upon such
conversion. For purposes of determining the Economic Capital Account Balance
attributable to a Class B Unit, allocations pursuant to Section 5.01(c) shall
be made in such a manner so as to allow the greatest number of Class B
Units to convert pursuant to this Section 15.04 at any time.

  



  

(b) _Adjustment to Gross Asset Value_.

  



  

(i) The General Partner shall provide the holders of Class B Units
the opportunity but not the obligation to make Capital Contributions to the
Partnership in exchange for OP Units in order to cause an adjustment to the
Gross Asset Value of the Partnership's assets within the meaning of paragraph
(b)(i) of the definition of Gross Asset Value up to two (2) times each fiscal
year including if the Partnership or the General Partner shall be a party to
any OP Unit Transaction; _provided_ , that the General Partner shall give
each holder of Class B Units written notice of such OP Unit Transaction at
least thirty (30) days prior to entering into any definitive agreement
pursuant to which the OP Unit Transaction would be consummated;

  



  

(ii) For purposes of clause (i) of this Section 15.04(b), the value
of each OP Unit issued in order to cause an adjustment to the Gross Asset
Value of the Partnership's assets shall be an amount equal to the product of
(y) the Value of one REIT Share as of the date the holder of Class B Units
makes a Capital Contribution to the Partnership multiplied by (z) the
Conversion Factor.

  



   

70 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the issuance of Class B Units shall
be treated as an event allowing for an adjustment to the Gross Asset Value of
the Partnership's assets within the meaning of paragraph (b)(iv) of the
definition of Gross Asset Value.

  



  

(c) _Impact of Conversion for Purposes of Section 5.01(c)_. For
purposes of making future allocations under Section 5.01(c), the portion of
the Economic Capital Account Balance of the applicable holder of Class B Units
that is treated as attributable to his, her or its Class B Units shall be
reduced, as of the date of conversion, by the product of the number of Class B
Units converted and the OP Unit Economic Balance.

  



  

(d) _OP Unit Transactions_. Immediately prior to or concurrent with
an OP Unit Transaction the maximum number of Class B Units then eligible for
conversion (in accordance with the provisions of Section 15.04(a)) shall
automatically be converted into an equal number of OP Units, giving effect to
all adjustments (if any) made pursuant to Section 15.01 hereof, taking into
account any allocations that occur in connection with the OP Unit Transaction
or that would occur in connection with the OP Unit Transaction if the
assets of the Partnership were sold at the OP Unit Transaction price or, if
applicable, at a value determined by the General Partner in good faith using
the value attributed to the Partnership Units in the context of the OP Unit
Transaction (in which case the Conversion Date shall be the effective date of
the OP Unit Transaction). In anticipation of such OP Unit Transaction, the
Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each holder of
Class B Units to be afforded the right to receive in connection with such OP
Unit Transaction in consideration for the OP Units into which his, her or its
Class B Units will be converted the same kind and amount of cash, securities
and other property (or any combination thereof) receivable upon the
consummation of such OP Unit Transaction by a holder of the same number of OP
Units, assuming such holder of OP Units is not a Person with which the
Partnership consolidated or into which the Partnership merged or which merged
into the Partnership or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case
may be (a "Constituent Person"), or an affiliate of a Constituent Person. In
the event that holders of OP Units have the opportunity to elect the form or
type of consideration to be received upon consummation of the OP Unit
Transaction, prior to such OP Unit Transaction the General Partner shall give
prompt written notice to each holder of Class B Units of such election, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to afford the holders of Class B
Units the right to elect, by written notice to the General Partner, the form
or type of consideration to be received upon conversion of each Class B Unit
held by such holder into OP Units in connection with such OP Unit
Transaction. If a holder of Class B Units fails to make such an election, such
holder (and any of its transferees) shall receive upon conversion of each
Class B Unit held by him, her or it (or by any of his, her or its
transferees) the same kind and amount of consideration that a holder of an OP
Unit would receive if such OP Unit holder failed to make such an election.
The Partnership shall use commercially reasonable effort to cause the terms of
any OP Unit Transaction to be consistent with the provisions of this Section
15.04(d) and to enter into an agreement with the successor or
purchasing entity, as the case may be, for the benefit of any holders of
Class B Units whose Class B Units will not be converted into OP Units in
connection with the OP Unit Transaction that will (i) contain provisions
enabling the holders of Class B Units that remain outstanding after such OP
Unit Transaction to convert their Class B Units into securities as comparable
as reasonably possible under the circumstances to the OP Units and (ii)
preserve as far as reasonably possible under the circumstances the
distribution, special allocation, conversion, and other rights set forth in
this Agreement for the benefit of the holders of Class B Units.

15.05 _Profits Interests_.

  



  

(a) Class B Units are intended to qualify as a "profits interest" in
the Partnership issued to a new or existing Partner in a partner capacity for
services performed or to be performed to or for the benefit of the Partnership
within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 93-27, 1993-2 C.B. 343, and Rev. Proc.
2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191, the Code, the Regulations, and other future guidance
provided by the IRS with respect thereto, and the allocations under Section
5.01(c) shall be interpreted in a manner that is consistent therewith.

  



  

(b) The Partners agree that the General Partner may make a Safe
Harbor Election, on behalf of itself and of all Partners, to have the
Safe Harbor apply irrevocably with respect to Class B Units transferred in
connection with the performance of services by a Partner in a partner
capacity. The Safe Harbor Election shall be effective as of the date of
issuance of such Class B Units. If such election is made, (i) the Partnership
and each Partner agree to comply with all requirements of the Safe Harbor with
respect to all interests in the Partnership transferred in connection with
the performance of services by a Partner in a partner capacity, whether
such Partner was admitted as a Partner or as the transferee of a previous
Partner, and (ii) the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to comply
with all record-keeping requirements and other administrative requirements
with respect to the Safe Harbor as shall be required by proposed or final
regulations relating thereto.

  



  

(c) The Partners agree that if a Safe Harbor Election is made by the
General Partner, (A) each Class B Unit issued hereunder is a Safe Harbor
Interest, (B) each Class B Unit represents a profits interest received for
services rendered or to be rendered to or for the benefit of the Partnership
by such holder of Class B Units in his, her or its capacity as a Partner or in
anticipation of becoming a Partner, and (C) the fair market value of each
Class B Unit issued by the Partnership upon receipt by such holder of Class
B Units as of the date of issuance is zero (plus the amount, if any, of any
Capital Contributions made to the Partnership by such holder of Class B Units
in connection with the issuance of such Class B Unit), representing the
liquidation value of such interest upon receipt (with such valuation being
consented to and hereby approved by all Partners).

  



  

(d) Each Partner, by signing this Agreement or by accepting such
transfer, hereby agrees (A) to comply with all requirements of any
Safe Harbor Election made by the General Partner with respect to each holder
of Class B Units' Safe Harbor Interest, (B) that each holder of Class B Units
shall take into account of all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
credit associated with its Class B Units as if they were fully vested in
computing its federal income tax liability for the entire period during which
it holds the Class B Units, (C) that neither the Partnership nor any Partner
shall claim a deduction (as wages, compensation or otherwise) for the fair
market value of such Class B Units issued to a holder of such Class B Units,
either at the time of grant of the Class B Units or at the time the Class B
Units becomes substantially vested, and (D) that to the extent that such
profits interest is forfeited after the date hereof, the Partnership shall
make special forfeiture allocations of gross items of income, deduction or
loss (including, as may be permitted by or under Regulations (or other rules
promulgated) to be adopted, notional items of income, deduction or loss) in
accordance with the Regulations to be adopted under Sections 704(b) and 83 of
the Code.

(e) The General Partner shall file or cause the Partnership to file
all returns, reports and other documentation as may be required,
as reasonably determined by the General Partner, to perfect and maintain any
Safe Harbor Election made by the General Partner with respect to granting of
each holder of Class B Units' Safe Harbor Interest.

  



  

(f) The General Partner is hereby authorized and empowered, without
further vote or action of the Partners, to amend this Agreement to the extent
necessary or helpful in accordance with the advice of Partnership tax counsel
or accountants to sustain the Partnership's position that (A) it has complied
with the Safe Harbor requirements in order to provide for a Safe Harbor
Election and it has ability to maintain the same, or (B) the issuance of the
Class B Units is not a taxable event with respect to the holders of Class B
Units, and the General Partner shall have the authority to execute any such
amendment by and on behalf of each Partner pursuant to the power of attorney
granted by this Agreement. Any undertaking by any Partner necessary or
desirable to (A) enable or preserve a Safe Harbor Election or (B) otherwise
to prevent the issuance of Class B Units from being a taxable event with
respect to the holders of Class B Units may be reflected in such amendments
and, to the extent so reflected, shall be binding on each Partner.

  



  

(g) Each Partner agrees to cooperate with the General Partner to

EXHIBIT B

  



  

AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL TRUST III, INC.

  



  

OFFICER CERTIFICATE

  



  

The undersigned officer of American Realty Capital Trust III, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the opinions as to
certain tax matters to be delivered by Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP and Duane
Morris LLP in connection with the merger (the "Merger") and related
transactions contemplated by, and pursuant to Sections 7.3(f) and 7.2(f),
respectively, of, the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement")1
dated as of December 14, 2012, by and among the Company, American Realty
Capital Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Parent"), Tiger
Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and certain other parties and
recognizing that said counsel will rely on this Officer's Certificate in
delivering their opinions, hereby certifies and represents that (i) the facts
that relate to the Merger and related transactions, including the plans or
intentions of Parent, as described in the Merger Agreement and the Form S-4
filed in connection with the Merger, including the Joint Proxy Statement
contained therein, each as amended or supplemented through the date hereof
are true, correct, and complete in all material respects, and (ii) the
following statements and representations stated herein are true, correct, and
complete:

  



  

1. The Merger will be consummated in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with applicable state corporation and limited liability company laws. The Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 represent the entire understanding of the Company with respect to the Merger and there are no other written or oral agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in the Merger Agreement. None of the terms and conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 have been or will be waived or modified and each of the representations relating to the Merger and contained in the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 is true, correct and complete in all material respects. The terms of the Merger Agreement and all other agreements entered into in connection therewith are the result of arm's length negotiations. The Company has bona fide business reasons for engaging in the Merger, in particular, to combine the business operations of Parent and the Company.

  



  

2. The fair market value of the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration (together with any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, the "Merger Consideration") received by each Company shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Company Common Stock surrendered by such Company shareholder in the Merger. No Company shareholder will retain any rights in Company Common Stock cancelled pursuant to the Merger.

  



  

  



  

1 Terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in, and shall be
interpreted in accordance with, the applicable federal income tax law and
regulations. Except as otherwise provided, capitalized terms used but not
defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.
Except as otherwise indicated, all "Section" references contained herein
refer to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and all
"Treasury Regulation Section" references are to the Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  



   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

3. Commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2011, the Company has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust within the meaning of Section 856 for all taxable periods ending before the Merger. The Company intends to continue to so qualify for its taxable year that will end with the Merger.

  



  

4. Pursuant to the Merger, no holder of Company Common Stock will receive in exchange for Company Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the Merger Consideration. To the best knowledge of the Company, neither Parent nor a person related to Parent as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4) (a "Parent Related Person") or any person acting as agent or intermediary for any of them has acquired or will acquire Company Common Stock with consideration other than the Merger Consideration issued in connection with the Merger. Neither the Company nor any person related (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4) but without regard to Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4)(i)(A)) to the Company or any person acting as agent or intermediary for any of them has acquired Company Common Stock prior to and in connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part. Prior to and in connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part, no dividend or other distribution has been or will be made with respect to Company Common Stock, either directly or through any transaction, agreement or arrangement with any other person, other than (i) normal, regular, dividend distributions made pursuant to the historic dividend paying practice of the Company to all holders of Company Common Stock on the relevant record date with respect to such dividends or distributions or (ii) distributions described in Section 857 as required for the Company's continued treatment as a REIT (and in order to avoid any income or excise tax imposed on the Company). For purposes of this representation, "acquire" will include any acquisition, actually or in substance, including through derivative transactions such as collars or put protection arrangements, which has the economic effect of a transfer of the burdens, benefits, or other aspects of ownership.

  



  

5. To the knowledge of the Company, Parent has no plan or intention to, after the Merger, make a dividend or other distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock to holders of Parent Common Stock who are former stockholders of the Company other than (i) normal, regular, dividend distributions made pursuant to the historic dividend paying practice of Parent to all holders of Parent Common Stock on the relevant record date with respect to such dividends or distributions or (ii) distributions described in Section 857 as required for Parent's continued treatment as a REIT (and in order to avoid any income or excise tax imposed on Parent).

  



  

6. To the knowledge of the Company, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets of the Company except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers and successive transfers permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k)(1).

  



  

7. To the knowledge of the Company, Merger Sub was formed by Parent for the sole purpose of participating in the Merger, and prior to the Merger, Merger Sub did not own any material assets, have any liabilities or assets subject to any liabilities, or conduct any business activities. To the knowledge of the Company, Merger Sub will be, at all times from the date of its formation until and including the Effective Time, disregarded as an entity separate from Parent for United States federal income tax purposes. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no plan for Merger Sub to issue additional interests of its equity to any person other than Parent or for Parent to sell the equity interests of Merger Sub that it currently holds.

  



   

2 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

8. To the knowledge of the Company, neither Parent nor any Parent Related Person has any plan or intention to redeem or otherwise acquire (or cause to be redeemed or acquired) any Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger (except for possible purchases of such shares that may be made by Parent on the open market as part of a repurchase program, which purchases and program satisfy the requirements of Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701) and, after the Merger, no Company stockholder will cause a redemption or acquisition of any Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger. For purposes of this representation, the term "redeem" or "acquire" includes any redemption or acquisition, as the case may be, actually or in substance, including through derivative transactions such as collars or put protection arrangements, which has the economic effect of a transfer of the burdens, benefits, or other aspects of ownership.

  



  

9. No equity interests, or other rights or interests that could be treated as equity interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the Company are outstanding except for Company Common Stock.

  



  

10. The liabilities of the Company assumed by Merger Sub (as determined under Section 357(d)) and the liabilities to which the transferred assets of the Company are subject were incurred by the Company in the ordinary course of its business.

  



  

11. The Company conducts a "historic business" for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d), and no assets of the Company have been sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of that would prevent Parent from continuing such "historic business" or from using a "significant portion" of the Company's "historic business assets" in a business following the Merger (as such terms are used in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)). To the knowledge of the Company, Parent is in the same line of business as the Company for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(2). To the knowledge of the Company, following the Merger, Parent, or a member of its qualified group of corporations (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)), will continue the "historic business" of the Company or use a "significant portion" of the Company's "historic business assets" in a business, as such terms are defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d).

  



  

12. Except for certain fees for printing, filing and distribution services relating to the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement, which Parent and the Company have agreed to share equally, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, and the shareholders of the Company will each pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and no liabilities of the shareholders of the Company will be assumed by Merger Sub or Parent in the Merger.

  



  

13. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent (or any of its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub), on the one hand, and the Company (or any of its subsidiaries), on the other hand, that was issued, acquired or will be settled at a discount.

  



   

3 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

14. The Company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a "title 11 or similar case" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A).

  



  

15. To the knowledge of the Company, prior to the Merger, neither Parent nor any corporation affiliated with Parent owned, directly or indirectly, nor had Parent or any such affiliated corporation owned, directly or indirectly, during the five years preceding the Effective Time, any shares of stock of the Company or securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company stock or other securities issued by the Company.

  



  

16. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of the Company will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the assets are subject.

  



  

17. The payment of cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to the Company shareholders instead of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to the Company shareholders in exchange for their shares of Company Common Stock. The fractional share interests of each Company shareholder will be aggregated, and no Company shareholder, with the possible exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts, held under separate names, held jointly or held with multiple brokers, will receive cash with respect to fractional shares in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

18. None of the payments received (or to be received) by any shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor of the Company that are designated as compensation have been or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any Company Common Stock held by such shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor; none of the Merger Consideration received by any shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent contractor was (or will be) separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement or agreement; and the compensation paid (or to be paid) to any shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent contractor was (or will be) for services actually rendered or to be rendered and was (or will be) commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's length for similar services. No portion of the Merger Consideration will be received by a Company shareholder as a creditor, employee, or in any other capacity other than as a Company shareholder and no Company shareholder acted as an agent for Parent in connection with the Merger or approval thereof.

  



  

19. To the knowledge of the Company, Parent will satisfy the information reporting requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3 with respect to the Merger.

  



  

20. The Company is an "investment company" as defined in Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii); however, the Company meets the requirements of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(i) because it is a REIT.

  



   

4 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

21. The Merger will be effected pursuant to Maryland and Delaware statutes as a result of the operation of which the following events will occur simultaneously at the Effective Time: (i) all of the assets and liabilities of the Company become the assets and liabilities of the Surviving Entity (other than any liabilities satisfied or discharged in the transaction) and (ii) the Company's separate legal existence ceases for all purposes.

  



  

22. The Company has not and will not take or fail to take any action that, by such action or failure, would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and the Company will not take any position on any federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

23. The undersigned is authorized to make all of the representations set forth herein on behalf of the Company.

The Company understands that Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, as special counsel
to the Company, and Duane Morris LLP, as special counsel to Parent, will rely,
without further inquiry, on this Officer's Certificate in rendering their
opinions concerning the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a), and hereby commits to inform said counsel if, for
any reason, any of the foregoing representations or statements ceases to be
true, correct or complete prior to the Effective Time. The Company also
recognizes that the opinions delivered by Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP and
Duane Morris LLP will not address any tax consequences of the Merger or any
action in connection therewith except as expressly set forth in the letters
containing such opinions

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have, on behalf of the Company, caused this Officer's

(the "Merger") and related transactions contemplated by, and pursuant to
Sections 7.3(f) and 7.2(f), respectively, of, the Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the "Merger Agreement")1 dated as of December 14, 2012, by and among
American Realty Capital Trust III, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the
"Company"), Parent, Merger Sub, and certain other parties and recognizing that
said counsel will rely on this Officer's Certificate in delivering their
opinions, hereby certifies and represents that (i) the facts that relate to
the Merger and related transactions, including the plans or intentions of
Parent, as described in the Merger Agreement and the Form S-4 filed in
connection with the Merger, including the Joint Proxy Statement contained
therein, each as amended or supplemented through the date hereof are true,
correct, and complete in all material respects, and (ii) the following
statements and representations stated herein are true, correct, and complete:

  



  

1. The Merger will be consummated in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with applicable state corporation and limited liability company laws. The Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 represent the entire understanding of Parent with respect to the Merger and there are no other written or oral agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in the Merger Agreement. None of the terms and conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 have been or will be waived or modified and each of the representations relating to the Merger and contained in the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and the other documents described in the Form S-4 is true, correct and complete in all material respects. The terms of the Merger Agreement and all other agreements entered into in connection therewith are the result of arm's length negotiations. Parent has bona fide business reasons for engaging in the Merger, in particular, to combine the business operations of Parent and the Company.

  



  

2. The fair market value of the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration (together with any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, the "Merger Consideration") received by each Company shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Company Common Stock surrendered by such Company shareholder in the Merger. No Company shareholder will retain any rights in Company Common Stock cancelled pursuant to the Merger.

  



  

  



  

1 Terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in, and shall be
interpreted in accordance with, the applicable federal income tax law and
regulations. Except as otherwise provided, capitalized terms used but not
defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.
Except as otherwise indicated, all "Section" references contained herein
refer to sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and all
"Treasury Regulation Section" references are to the Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder.

3. Commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2011, Parent has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") within the meaning of Section 856 for all taxable periods ending before the Merger. Parent intends to continue to so qualify for the taxable period which includes the Merger.

  



  

4. Pursuant to the Merger, no holder of Company Common Stock will receive in exchange for Company Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration other than the Merger Consideration. Neither Parent nor a person related to Parent as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4) (a "Parent Related Person") or any person acting as agent or intermediary for any of them has acquired or will acquire Company Common Stock for consideration other than the Merger Consideration issued in connection with the Merger. To the knowledge of Parent, neither the Company nor any person related (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4) but without regard to Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(4)(i)(A)) to the Company or any person acting as agent or intermediary for any of them has acquired Company Common Stock prior to and in connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part. To the knowledge of Parent, prior to and in connection with the Merger or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part, no dividend or other distribution has been or will be made with respect to Company Common Stock, either directly or through any transaction, agreement or arrangement with any other person, other than (i) normal, regular, dividend distributions made pursuant to the historic dividend paying practice of the Company to all holders of Company Common Stock on the relevant record date with respect to such dividends or distributions or (ii) distributions described in Section 857 as required for the Company's continued treatment as a REIT (and in order to avoid any income or excise tax imposed on the Company). For purposes of this representation, "acquire" will include any acquisition, actually or in substance, including through derivative transactions such as collars or put protection arrangements, which has the economic effect of a transfer of the burdens, benefits, or other aspects of ownership.

  



  

5. Parent has no plan or intention to, after the Merger, make a dividend or other distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock to holders of Parent Common Stock who are former stockholders of the Company other than (i) normal, regular, dividend distributions made pursuant to the historic dividend paying practice of Parent to all holders of Parent Common Stock on the relevant record date with respect to such dividends or distributions or (ii) distributions described in Section 857 as required for Parent's continued treatment as a REIT (and in order to avoid any income or excise tax imposed on Parent).

  



  

6. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets of the Company except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers and successive transfers permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k)(1).

  



   

2 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

7. Merger Sub was formed by Parent for the sole purpose of participating in the Merger, and prior to the Merger, Merger Sub did not own any material assets, have any liabilities or assets subject to any liabilities, or conduct any business activities. Merger Sub will be, at all times from the date of its formation until and including the Effective Time, disregarded as an entity separate from Parent for United States federal income tax purposes. There is no plan for Merger Sub to issue additional interests of its equity to any person other than Parent or for Parent to sell the equity interests of Merger Sub that it currently holds.

  



  

8. Neither Parent nor any Parent Related Person has any plan or intention to redeem or otherwise acquire (or cause to be redeemed or acquired) any Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger (except for possible purchases of such shares that may be made by Parent on the open market as part of a repurchase program, which purchases and program satisfy the requirements of Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701) and, after the Merger, to the knowledge of Parent, no Company stockholder will cause a redemption or acquisition of any Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger. For purposes of this representation, the term "redeem" or "acquire" includes any redemption or acquisition, as the case may be, actually or in substance, including through derivative transactions such as collars or put protection arrangements, which has the economic effect of a transfer of the burdens, benefits, or other aspects of ownership.

  



  

9. To the knowledge of Parent, no equity interests, or other rights or interests that could be treated as equity interests for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the Company are outstanding except for Company Common Stock.

  



  

10. To the knowledge of Parent, the liabilities of the Company assumed by Merger Sub (as determined under Section 357(d)) and the liabilities to which the transferred assets of the Company are subject were incurred by the Company in the ordinary course of its business.

  



  

11. To the knowledge of Parent, the Company conducts a "historic business" for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d), and no assets of the Company have been sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of that would prevent Parent from continuing such "historic business" or from using a "significant portion" of the Company's "historic business assets" in a business following the Merger (as such terms are used in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)). To the knowledge of Parent, Parent is in the same line of business as the Company for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(2). Following the Merger, Parent, or a member of its qualified group of corporations (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)), will continue the "historic business" of the Company or use a "significant portion" of the Company's "historic business assets" in a business, as such terms are defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d).

  



  

12. Except for certain fees for printing, filing and distribution services relating to the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement, which Parent and the Company have agreed to share equally, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, and the shareholders of the Company will each pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and no liabilities of the shareholders of the Company will be assumed by Merger Sub or Parent in the Merger.

  



   

3 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

13. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent (or any of its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub), on the one hand, and the Company (or any of its subsidiaries), on the other hand, that was issued, acquired or will be settled at a discount.

  



  

14. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is under the jurisdiction of a court in a "title 11 or similar case" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A).

  



  

15. Prior to the Merger, neither Parent nor any corporation affiliated with Parent owned, directly or indirectly, nor had Parent or any such affiliated corporation owned, directly or indirectly, during the five years preceding the Effective Time, any shares of stock of the Company or securities, options, warrants or instruments giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company stock or other securities issued by the Company.

  



  

16. Immediately after the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of Parent will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the assets are subject.

  



  

17. The payment of cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to the Company shareholders instead of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to the Company shareholders in exchange for their shares of Company Common Stock. The fractional share interests of each Company shareholder will be aggregated, and no Company shareholder, with the possible exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts, held under separate names, held jointly or held with multiple brokers, will receive cash with respect to fractional shares in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

18. None of the payments received (or to be received) by any shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor of the Company that are designated as compensation have been or will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any Company Common Stock held by such shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor; none of the Merger Consideration received by any shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent contractor was (or will be) separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar arrangement or agreement; and the compensation paid (or to be paid) to any shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent contractor was (or will be) for services actually rendered or to be rendered and was (or will be) commensurate with amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's length for similar services. No portion of the Merger Consideration will be received by a Company shareholder as a creditor, employee, or in any other capacity other than as a Company shareholder and no Company shareholder acted as an agent for Parent in connection with the Merger or approval thereof.

  



  

19. Parent will satisfy the information reporting requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3 with respect to the Merger.

  



   

4 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

20. Parent is an "investment company" as defined in Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii); however, Parent meets the requirements of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(i) because it is a REIT. Merger Sub is not an "investment company" as defined in Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii).

  



  

21. The Merger will be effected pursuant to Maryland and Delaware statutes as a result of the operation of which the following events will occur simultaneously at the Effective Time: (i) all of the assets and liabilities of the Company become the assets and liabilities of the Surviving Entity (other than any liabilities satisfied or discharged in the transaction) and (ii) the Company's separate legal existence ceases for all purposes.

  



  

22. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving Entity have not and will not take or fail to take any action that, by such action or failure, would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and Parent and the Surviving Entity will not take any position on any federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

23. The undersigned is authorized to make all of the representations set forth herein on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub.

   | RE:| _Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 14, 2012_   
---|---|--- 
  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

You have requested our opinion regarding certain federal income tax
consequences of the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of American Realty Capital Trust
III, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "), with and into Tiger
Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Merger Sub_ ") and
a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of American Realty Capital Properties, Inc.,
a Maryland corporation (" _Parent_ "), with Merger Sub surviving, pursuant to
the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of
December 14, 2012, by and among Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, and certain
other parties. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the
meanings specified in the Merger Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

  



  

In acting as special counsel to Parent in connection with the Merger, we have
participated in the preparation of the Merger Agreement, and pursuant to
Section 7.2(f) of the Merger Agreement, you have requested our opinion
regarding whether, on the basis of the facts, representations and
assumptions set forth herein, the Merger will qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "). In connection with this opinion, we have examined
originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction,
of such documentation and information provided to us by you as we have deemed
necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein,
including the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement, and
the other documents described in the Form S-4. In addition, this opinion
relies upon certificates containing certain factual representations and
covenants of an officer of the Company (the " _Company Officer Certificate_ ")
and an officer of Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Parent Officer Certificate_
").

  



  

For purposes of our opinion, we have not independently verified all of the
facts, representations and covenants set forth in the Company Officer
Certificate, the Parent Officer Certificate or in any other document. We
have, consequently, assumed and relied on representations that the
information presented in the Company Officer Certificate, the Parent Officer
Certificate and other documents, or otherwise furnished to us, accurately and
completely describes all material facts relevant to our opinion. We have
assumed that such statements, representations and covenants are true without
regard to any qualification as to materiality, knowledge or belief. In the
course of our representation of Parent, we have not been made aware of any
facts inconsistent with such statements, representations and covenants or our
assumptions herein. Our opinion is conditioned on the continuing accuracy and
completeness of such statements, representations and covenants and our
assumptions herein. Any material change or inaccuracy in the facts referred
to, set forth, or assumed herein or in the Company Officer Certificate, the
Parent Officer Certificate, or any other document may affect our conclusions
set forth herein.

  



   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

In our review of certain documents in connection with our opinion as
expressed below, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons,
the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all
documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, electronic or photostatic
copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. Where
documents have been provided to us in draft form, we have assumed that the
final executed versions of such documents will not differ materially from
such drafts.

  



  

Our opinion is also based on the accuracy of the following assumptions: (i)
the Company and Parent will each qualify as a REIT for the taxable period in
which the Merger is consummated, (ii) there will be no changes in the
applicable laws of the State of Maryland or the State of Delaware or of
any other jurisdiction under the laws of which any of the Company, Parent or
any of their subsidiaries have been formed or to which any of them are
subject, in any such case, that would have the effect of altering the facts
upon which the opinion set forth below is based, (iii) no action will be
taken by the Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries after the date
hereof that would have the effect of altering facts upon which the opinion
set forth below is based, (iv) the Merger will be consummated in the
manner contemplated by, and in accordance with the provisions of, the Merger
Agreement and the Merger will be effective under the laws of State of
Maryland and the State of Delaware, (v) the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and
the other documents described in the Form S-4 represent the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the Merger, and (vi) the parties
will report the Merger in a manner consistent with the opinion below and all
applicable reporting requirements pursuant to the Code and the
Regulations (as defined below) will be satisfied.

  



  

In rendering our opinion, we have considered and relied upon the Code, the
regulations promulgated thereunder (" _Regulations_ "), administrative rulings
and other Treasury interpretations of the Code and Regulations by the courts
and the IRS, all as they exist at the date hereof. It should be noted that
the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations
are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with
retroactive effect. A change that is made after the date hereof in any of the
foregoing could adversely affect our conclusions set forth herein. In this
regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents
counsel's best judgment as to the outcome on the merits with respect to such
issue, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that
the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that
a court will not sustain such a position if asserted by the IRS.

  



  

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications
stated herein, we are of the opinion that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

We express no opinion on any issue relating to the Merger, the Company,
Parent or any investment therein or with respect to any other federal tax
matters or to any issues arising under the tax laws of any other country, or
any state or locality, other than as expressly stated above. This opinion
is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to, and we
do not intend to, supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal
developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof or the
impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement,
representation, covenant, or assumption relied upon herein that becomes
incorrect or untrue. This opinion has been prepared for you and it may not be
used or relied upon by anyone else other than Parent, nor may this letter
or any copies hereof be furnished to a third party, filed with a governmental
agency, quoted, cited or otherwise referred to without our prior written
consent.

  



  

 _Circular 230 Disclosure_

  



  

To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service, we hereby disclose that (i) any discussion of federal tax issues
contained or referred to in this opinion was not written, and cannot be used
for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed under the Code and
(ii) this opinion is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used,
for the purpose of promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any
transaction or matter addressed herein.

expense in accordance with GAAP) of all Real Estate Assets held by the
Company as of the last day of the immediately preceding month, (i) one
twelfth of 0.50% of the lesser of such sum or $3.0 billion and (ii) one
twelfth of 0.40% of the excess of such sum over $3.0 billion, if any. The
Base Management Fee will be pro rated for any partial month. The Manager shall

day of each calendar month for which a Base Management Fee is payable. The
Company shall pay the Manager each installment of the Base Management Fee
within five (5) Business Days after the date of delivery to the Company of

(d) The Incentive Compensation shall be payable in arrears, in
quarterly installments commencing with the quarter in which this Agreement is
executed. The Manager shall compute each quarterly installment of the
Incentive Compensation within forty-five (45) days after the end of the
calendar quarter with respect to which such installment is payable. A copy of
the computations made by the Manager to calculate such installment shall
thereafter promptly be delivered to the Board and, upon such delivery, payment
of such installment of the Incentive Compensation shown therein shall be due
and payable no later than the date which is five (5) Business Days after
the date of delivery to the Board of such computations.

  



  

(e) Each installment of the Incentive Compensation shall be payable
as follows:

  



  

(i) fifty percent (50%) of the Incentive Compensation will be
payable in shares of Common Stock; _provided, however,_ the percentage of the
Incentive Compensation payable in shares of Common Stock is subject to the
following: (1) the ownership of such shares by the Manager does not violate
the limit on ownership of Common Stock set forth in the Company's Governing
Instruments, after giving effect to any waiver from such limit that the Board
may grant to the Manager in the future and (2) the Company's issuance of such
shares to the Manager complies with all applicable restrictions under U.S.
federal securities laws and the rules of NASDAQ; and

  



  

(ii) the remainder will be payable in cash.

  



  

(f) The number of shares of Common Stock payable as the Incentive
Compensation to be issued to the Manager will be equal to the dollar
amount of the portion of the quarterly installment of the Incentive
Compensation payable in shares of Common Stock divided by a value determined
as follows:

  



  

(i) if the Common Stock is traded on a securities exchange, the
value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the
Common Stock on such exchange on the five (5) Business Days prior to the date
on which the quarterly installment of the Incentive Compensation is paid;

  



  

(ii) if the Common Stock is not traded on a securities exchange but
is actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be deemed to be the
average of the closing bids or sales prices, as applicable, on the five (5)
Business Days prior to the date on which the quarterly installment of the
Incentive Compensation is paid; and

  



  

(iii) if the Common Stock is neither traded on a securities exchange
nor actively traded over-the-counter, the value shall be the fair
market value thereof, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board
(including a majority of the Independent Directors) of the Company.

  



  

(g) If at any time the Manager shall, in connection with a
determination of the value of the Common Stock made by the Board pursuant to
_Section 6(f)(iii)_ hereof, (i) dispute such determination in good faith by
more than five percent (5%), and (ii) such dispute cannot be resolved between
the Independent Directors and the Manager within ten (10) Business Days after
the Manager provides written notice to the Company of such dispute (the "
_Valuation Notice_ "), then the matter shall be resolved by an
independent appraiser of recognized standing selected jointly by the
Independent Directors and the Manager within not more than twenty (20) days
after the Valuation Notice. In the event the Independent Directors and the
Manager cannot agree with respect to such selection within the aforesaid
twenty (20) day time-frame, the Independent Directors shall select one such
independent appraiser and the Manager shall select one independent appraiser
within five (5) Business Days after the expiration of the twenty (20) day
period, with one additional such appraiser (the " _Last Appraiser_ ") to be
selected by the appraisers so designated within five (5) Business Days after
their selection. Any valuation decision made by the Last Appraiser shall be
deemed final and binding upon the Board and the Manager and shall be
delivered to the Manager and the Board within not more than fifteen (15) days
after the selection of the Last Appraiser. The expenses of the appraisal
shall be paid by the party with the estimate which deviated the furthest from
the final valuation decision made by the independent appraisers.

Section 8. Limits of the Manager's Responsibility.

  



  

(a) The Manager assumes no responsibility under this Agreement other
than to render the services called for hereunder in good faith and shall
not be responsible for any action of the Board in following or declining to
follow any advice or recommendations of the Manager, including as set forth
in the Investment Guidelines. The Manager and its Affiliates, and the
directors, officers, employees, partners, members, stockholders, other equity
holders, agents and representatives of the Manager and its Affiliates (each, a
" _Manager Indemnified Party_ "), will not be liable to the Company, any
Subsidiary, the Board, the Company's stockholders or any
Subsidiary's stockholders, partners or members for any acts or omissions by
any Manager Indemnified Party performed in accordance with and pursuant to
this Agreement, except by reason of any act or omission constituting bad
faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the
duties under this Agreement on the part of such Manager Indemnified Party. The
Company shall, to the full extent lawful, reimburse, indemnify and hold
harmless each Manager Indemnified Party, of and from any and all expenses,
losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims of any nature
whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively " _Losses_
") in respect of or arising from any acts or omissions of such Manager
Indemnified Party performed in good faith under this Agreement and not
constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of duties on the part of such Manager Indemnified Party under this
Agreement. In addition, (i) the Manager will not be liable for trade errors
that may result from ordinary negligence, including, without limitation,
errors in the investment decision making process or in the trade process and
(ii) the Company shall advance funds to a Manager Indemnified Party for legal
fees and other costs and expenses incurred as a result of any claim, suit,
action or proceeding for which indemnification is being sought, _provided_
that such Manager Indemnified Party undertakes to repay the advanced funds to
the Company, together with the applicable legal rate of interest thereon, in
cases in which such Manager Indemnified Party is found pursuant to a final
and non-appealable order or judgment to not be entitled to indemnification.

(b) The Manager shall, to the full extent lawful, reimburse,
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and the directors, officers and
stockholders of the Company and each Person, if any, controlling the Company
(each, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ "; a Manager Indemnified Party and a
Company Indemnified Party are each sometimes hereinafter referred to as an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") of and from any and all Losses in respect of or
arising from (i) any acts or omissions of the Manager constituting bad faith,
willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duties of the
Manager under this Agreement or (ii) any claims by the Manager's employees
relating to the terms and conditions of their employment by the Manager.

  



  

(c) In case any such claim, suit, action or proceeding (a " _Claim_
") is brought against any Indemnified Party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought by such Indemnified Party pursuant hereto, the
Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice thereof to the
indemnifying party, which notice shall include all documents and information
in the possession of or under the control of such Indemnified Party
reasonably necessary for the evaluation and/or defense of such Claim and shall
specifically state that indemnification for such Claim is being sought under
this Section; _provided, however,_ that the failure of the Indemnified Party
to so notify the indemnifying party shall not limit or affect such Indemnified
Party's rights other than pursuant to this Section. Upon receipt of such
notice of Claim (together with such documents and information from such
Indemnified Party), the indemnifying party shall, at its sole cost and
expense, in good faith defend any such Claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, which counsel may, without
limiting the rights of such Indemnified Party pursuant to the next succeeding
sentence of this _Section 8(c)_ , also represent the indemnifying party in
such investigation, action or proceeding. In the alternative, such
Indemnified Party may elect to conduct the defense of the Claim, if (i) such
Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the conduct of its defense by
the indemnifying party could be materially prejudicial to its interests, (ii)
the indemnifying party refuses to assume such defense (or fails to give
written notice to the Indemnified Party within ten (10) days of receipt of a
notice of Claim that the indemnifying party assumes such defense), or (iii)
the indemnifying party shall have failed, in such Indemnified Party's
reasonable judgment, to defend the Claim in good faith. The indemnifying party
may settle any Claim against such Indemnified Party without such Indemnified
Party's consent, provided (i) such settlement is without any Losses
whatsoever to such Indemnified Party, (ii) the settlement does not include or
require any admission of liability or culpability by such Indemnified Party
and (iii) the indemnifying party obtains an effective written release of
liability for such Indemnified Party from the party to the Claim with whom
such settlement is being made, which release must be reasonably acceptable to
such Indemnified Party, and a dismissal with prejudice with respect to all
claims made by the party against such Indemnified Party in connection with
such Claim. The applicable Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with
the indemnifying party, at the indemnifying party's sole cost and expense, in
connection with the defense or settlement of any Claim in accordance with the
terms hereof. If such Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant to this _Section
8(c)_ to elect to defend such Claim by counsel of its own choosing and so
elects, then the indemnifying party shall be responsible for any good faith
settlement of such Claim entered into by such Indemnified Party. Except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no Indemnified Party may pay
or settle any Claim and seek reimbursement therefor under this _Section
8(c)_.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this Section 8 shall survive the expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9. No Joint Venture. The Company and the Manager are not partners or
joint venturers with each other and nothing herein shall be construed to make
them such partners or joint venturers or impose any liability as such on
either of them.

Section 10. Term; Renewal; Termination Without Cause.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall become effective on the Closing Date and
shall continue in operation, unless terminated in accordance with the terms
hereof, until the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Initial Term_
"). After the Initial Term, this Agreement shall be deemed renewed
automatically each year for an additional one-year period (an " _Automatic
Renewal Term_ ") unless the Company or the Manager elects not to renew this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 10(b)_ or  _Section 10(d)_,
respectively.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, upon written notice provided to the Manager no later than 180 days
prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Automatic Renewal Term
(the " _Termination Notice_ "), the Company may, without cause, in connection
with the expiration of the Initial Term or the then current Automatic Renewal
Term, decline to renew this Agreement (any such nonrenewal, a " _Termination
Without Cause_ ") upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the
Independent Directors that includes a finding by such two-thirds of the
Independent Directors that either (1) there has been unsatisfactory
performance by the Manager that is materially detrimental to the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (2) the Base Management Fee and
Incentive Compensation payable to the Manager are not fair, subject to
_Section 10(c)_ below. The Company may terminate this Agreement for cause
pursuant to _Section 12_ hereof even after providing a Termination Notice.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 10(b)_ , if the
reason for nonrenewal specified in the Termination Notice is that two-thirds
of the Independent Directors have determined that the Base Management Fee or
the Incentive Compensation payable to the Manager is unfair, the Company
shall not have the foregoing nonrenewal right in the event the Manager agrees
that it will continue to perform its duties hereunder during the Automatic
Renewal Term that would commence upon the expiration of the Initial Term or
then current Automatic Renewal Term at a fee that at least two-thirds of the
Independent Directors determine to be fair; _provided, however, _ the Manager
shall have the right to renegotiate the Base Management Fee and/or the
Incentive Compensation, by delivering to the Company, not less than 120 days
prior to the pending Effective Termination Date, written notice (a " _Notice
of Proposal to Negotiate_ ") of its intention to renegotiate the Base
Management Fee and/or the Incentive Compensation. Thereupon, the Company and
the Manager shall endeavor to negotiate the Base Management Fee and/or the
Incentive Compensation in good faith. Provided that the Company and the
Manager agree to a revised Base Management Fee, Incentive Compensation or
other compensation structure within sixty (60) days following the Company's
receipt of the Notice of Proposal to Negotiate, the Termination Notice from
the Company shall be deemed of no force and effect, and this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect on the terms stated herein, except that the
Base Management Fee, the Incentive Compensation or other compensation
structure shall be the revised Base Management Fee, Incentive Compensation or
other compensation structure as then agreed upon by the Company and
the Manager. The Company and the Manager agree to execute and deliver an
amendment to this Agreement setting forth such revised Base Management Fee,
Incentive Compensation, or other compensation structure promptly upon reaching
an agreement regarding same. In the event that the Company and the Manager
are unable to agree to a revised Base Management Fee, Incentive Compensation,
or other compensation structure during such sixty (60) day period, this
Agreement shall terminate on the Effective Termination Date.

  



  

(d) No later than 180 days prior to the expiration of the Initial
Term or the then current Automatic Renewal Term, the Manager may deliver
written notice to the Company informing it of the Manager's intention to
decline to renew this Agreement, whereupon this Agreement shall not be
renewed and extended and this Agreement shall terminate effective on the
anniversary date of this Agreement next following the delivery of such
notice.

  



  

(e) Except as set forth in this _Section 10_ , a nonrenewal of this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10_ shall be without any further
liability or obligation of either party to the other, except as provided in
_Section 3(c)_ , _Section 5_ , _Section 7_ , _Section 8_ and _Section 14_ of
this Agreement.

(f) The Manager shall cooperate with the Company in executing an
orderly transition of the management of the Company's consolidated assets to
a new manager.

  



  

Section 11. Assignments.

  



  

(a) _Assignments by the Manager._ This Agreement shall terminate
automatically in the event of its assignment, in whole or in part, by the
Manager, unless such assignment is consented to in writing by the Company
with the consent of a majority of the Independent Directors. Any such
permitted assignment shall bind the assignee under this Agreement in the same
manner as the Manager is bound, and the Manager shall be liable to the
Company for all acts or omissions of the assignee under any such assignment.
In addition, the assignee shall execute and deliver to the Company a
counterpart of this Agreement naming such assignee as the Manager.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Manager may, without the approval of the
Company's Independent Directors, (i) assign this Agreement to an Affiliate
of the Manager and (ii) delegate to one or more of its Affiliates the
performance of any of its responsibilities hereunder so long as it remains
liable for any such Affiliate's performance, in each case so long as
assignment or delegation does not require the Company's approval under the
Investment Company Act (but if such approval is required, the Company shall
not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent). Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall preclude any pledge, hypothecation or other transfer
of any amounts payable to the Manager under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Assignments by the Company._ This Agreement shall not be
assigned by the Company without the prior written consent of the Manager,
except in the case of assignment by the Company to another REIT or other
organization which is a successor (by merger, consolidation, purchase of
assets, or other transaction) to the Company, in which case such successor
organization shall be bound under this Agreement and by the terms of such
assignment in the same manner as the Company is bound under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12. Termination for Cause.

  



  

(a) The Company may terminate this Agreement effective upon 30 days'
prior written notice of termination from the Company to the Manager if (i)
the Manager, its agents or its assignees breaches any material provision of
this Agreement and such breach shall continue for a period of 30 days after
written notice thereof specifying such breach and requesting that the same be
remedied in such 30-day period (or 45 days after written notice of such
breach if the Manager takes steps to cure such breach within 30 days of the
written notice), (ii) there is a commencement of any proceeding relating to
the Manager's Bankruptcy or insolvency, including an order for relief in an
involuntary bankruptcy case or the Manager authorizing or filing a voluntary
bankruptcy petition, (iii) any Manager Change of Control which a majority of
the Independent Directors determines is materially detrimental to the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iv) the dissolution of the
Manager, or (v) the Manager commits fraud against the
Company, misappropriates or embezzles funds of the Company, or acts, or fails
to act, in a manner constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross
negligence or reckless disregard in the performance of its duties under this
Agreement; _provided, however,_ that if any of the actions or omissions
described in this clause (v) are caused by an employee and/or officer of the
Manager or one of its Affiliates and the Manager takes all necessary and
appropriate action against such person and cures the damage caused by
such actions or omissions within 30 days of the Manager's actual knowledge of
its commission or omission, the Company shall not have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 12(a)(v)_.

  



  

(b) The Manager may terminate this Agreement effective upon 60 days'
prior written notice of termination to the Company in the event that the
Company shall default in the performance or observance of any material term,
condition or covenant contained in this Agreement and such default shall
continue for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof specifying such
default and requesting that the same be remedied in such 30-day period.

(c) The Manager may terminate this Agreement if the Company becomes
required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act, with such termination deemed to occur immediately before such
event.

  



  

Section 13. Action Upon Termination. From and after the effective date of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 10_ ,  _11_ , or _12_ of
this Agreement, the Manager shall not be entitled to compensation for further
services hereunder, but shall be paid all compensation accruing to the date
of termination. Upon any such termination, the Manager shall forthwith:

  



  

(a) after deducting any accrued compensation and reimbursement for
its expenses to which it is then entitled, pay over to the Company or a
Subsidiary all money collected and held for the account of the Company or a
Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement;

  



  

(b) deliver to the Board a full accounting, including a statement

(c) deliver to the Board all property and documents of the Company

Section 14. Release of Money or Other Property Upon Written Request.

  



  

The Manager agrees that any money or other property of the Company (which
such term, for the purposes of this _Section 14_ , shall be deemed to include
any and all of its Subsidiaries, if any) held by the Manager shall be held by
the Manager as custodian for the Company, and the Manager's records shall be
appropriately and clearly marked to reflect the ownership of such money or
other property by the Company. Upon the receipt by the Manager of a written
request signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company requesting the
Manager to release to the Company any money or other property then held by the
Manager for the account of the Company under this Agreement, the Manager
shall release such money or other property to the Company within a reasonable
period of time, but in no event later than 60 days following such request.
Upon delivery of such money or other property to the Company, the Manager
shall not be liable to the Company, the Board, or the Company's stockholders
or partners for any acts or omissions by the Company in connection with the
money or other property released to the Company in accordance with this
_Section 14_. The Company shall indemnify the Manager, its directors,
officers, stockholders, employees and agents against any and all Losses which
arise in connection with the Manager's proper release of such money or other
property to the Company in accordance with the terms of this _Section 14_.
Indemnification pursuant to this provision shall be in addition to any right
of the Manager to indemnification under _Section 8_ of this Agreement.

violation of which would have a material adverse effect on the
business operations, assets or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, if any, taken as a whole, and will not result in, or require,
the creation or imposition of any lien or any of its property, assets or
revenues pursuant to the provisions of any such mortgage, indenture, lease,
contract or other agreement, instrument or undertaking.

its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except for failures to be so qualified, authorized or
licensed that could not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect
on the business operations, assets or financial condition of the Manager.

  



  

(ii) The Manager has the limited liability company power and
authority and the legal right to make, deliver and perform this Agreement
and all obligations required hereunder and has taken all necessary corporate

securities issued by, the Manager or of any mortgage, indenture, lease,
contract or other agreement, instrument or undertaking to which the Manager is
a party or by which the Manager or any of its assets may be bound, the
violation of which would have a material adverse effect on the
business operations, assets or financial condition of the Manager, and will
not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any lien or any of
its property, assets or revenues pursuant to the provisions of any such
mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement, instrument or
undertaking.

  



  

Section 16. The American Realty Capital Name.

  



  

The Manager and its Affiliates have or may have a proprietary interest in the
names "American Realty Capital," "ARC" and "AR Capital." The Manager hereby
grants to the Company, to the extent of any proprietary interest the Manager
may have in any of the names "American Realty Capital," "ARC" and "AR
Capital," a non-transferable, non-assignable, non-exclusive, royalty-free
right and license to use the names "American Realty Capital," "ARC" and "AR
Capital" during the term of this Agreement. The Company agrees that the
Manager and its Affiliates will have the right to approve of any use by the
Company of the names "American Realty Capital," "ARC" and "AR Capital," such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Accordingly,
and in recognition of this right, if at any time the Company ceases to retain
the Manager or one of its Affiliates to perform management services for
the Company, the Company will, promptly after receipt of written request from
the Manager, cease to conduct business under or use the names "American
Realty Capital," "ARC" and "AR Capital" or any derivative thereof and the
Company shall change its name and the names of any of its subsidiaries to a
name that does not contain the names "American Realty Capital," "ARC" and "AR
Capital" or any other word or words that might, in the reasonable
discretion of the Manager, be susceptible of indication of some form of
relationship between the Company and the Manager or any its Affiliates. At
such time, the Company will also make any changes to any trademarks,
servicemarks or other marks necessary to remove any references to the words
"American Realty Capital," "ARC" and "AR Capital." Consistent with the
foregoing, it is specifically recognized that the Manager or one or more of
its Affiliates has in the past and may in the future organize, sponsor or
otherwise permit to exist other investment vehicles (including vehicles for
investment in real estate) and financial and service organizations having any
of the names "American Realty Capital," "ARC" and "AR Capital" as a part of
their name, all without the need for any consent (and without the right to
object thereto) by the Company. Neither the Manager nor any of its
Affiliates makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, with
respect to the names "American Realty Capital," "ARC" and "AR Capital"
licensed hereunder or the use thereof (including without limitation as to
whether the use of the names "American Realty Capital," "ARC" and "AR
Capital" will be free from infringement of the intellectual property rights
of third parties. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Manager represents and
warrants that it is not aware of any pending claims or litigation or of any
claims threatened in writing regarding the use or ownership of the names
"American Realty Capital," "ARC" and "AR Capital."

Exhibit A

  



  

 _Investment Guidelines_

  



  

1. No investment shall be made that would cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code.

  



  

2. No investment shall be made that would cause the Company to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

  



  

3. The Company's investments shall be in the Target Assets.

  



  

4. Until appropriate investments in the Target Assets are identified, the Manager may invest the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and any future offerings of the Company's securities for cash in interest-bearing, short-term investments and money market accounts and/or funds, subject to the requirements for the Company's qualification as a REIT under the Code.

  



  

5. Before issuing any final form of commitment to acquire a Real Estate Asset, the transaction must be approved by the Manager Investment Committee.

  



  

6. Any proposed investment in a Real Estate Asset must be approved by a majority of the Independent Directors (or a committee established by the Independent Directors for this purpose). If a proposed investment in a Real Estate Asset is for less than $10 million, such approval may be sought via electronic board meetings, which entails emailing of the applicable materials to the Independent Directors (or the members of the committee established by the Independent Directors for this purpose) and any questions to be addressed in advance of voting on the proposed investment in a Real Estate Asset and requesting a response for approval, and whereby the Independent Directors (or the members of the committee established by the Independent Directors for this purpose) cast their votes in favor or against a proposed acquisition via email.

  



  

These Investment Guidelines may be amended, restated, modified, supplemented
or waived by the Board (which must include a majority of the Independent
Directors) without the approval of the Company's stockholders.

American Realty Capital Trust III, Inc.

  

405 Park Avenue

  

14th Floor

  

New York, NY 10022

  



   | Re:| _Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 14, 2012_ 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

You have requested our opinion regarding certain federal income tax
consequences of the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of American Realty Capital Trust
III, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "), with and into Tiger
Acquisition, LLC a Delaware limited liability company (" _Merger Sub_ ") and
a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of American Realty Capital Properties, Inc.,
a Maryland corporation (" _Parent_ "), with Merger Sub surviving, pursuant to
the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as
of December 14, 2012, by and among Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, and
certain other parties. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the
meanings specified in the Merger Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

  



  

In acting as counsel to the Company in connection with the Merger, we have
participated in the preparation of the Merger Agreement, and pursuant to
Section 7.3(f) of the Merger Agreement, you have requested our opinion
regarding whether, on the basis of the facts, representations and assumptions
set forth herein, the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "). In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals
or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such
documentation and information provided to us by you as we have deemed
necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein,
including the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement, and
the other documents described in the Form S-4. In addition, this opinion
relies upon certificates containing certain factual representations and
covenants of an officer of the Company (the " _Company Officer Certificate_ ")
and an officer of Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Parent Officer Certificate_
").

  



  

For purposes of our opinion, we have not independently verified all of the
facts, representations and covenants set forth in the Company Officer
Certificate, the Parent Officer Certificate or in any other document. We
have, consequently, assumed and relied on representations that the information
presented in the Company Officer Certificate, the Parent Officer Certificate
and other documents, or otherwise furnished to us, accurately and
completely describes all material facts relevant to our opinion. We have
assumed that such statements, representations and covenants are true without
regard to any qualification as to materiality, knowledge or belief. In the
course of our representation of the Company, we have not been made aware of
any facts inconsistent with such statements, representations and covenants or
our assumptions herein. Our opinion is conditioned on the continuing accuracy
and completeness of such statements, representations and covenants and
our assumptions herein. Any material change or inaccuracy in the facts
referred to, set forth, or assumed herein or in the Company Officer
Certificate, the Parent Officer Certificate, or any other document may affect
our conclusions set forth herein.

  



   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

In our review of certain documents in connection with our opinion as
expressed below, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons,
the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all
documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, electronic or photostatic
copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. Where
documents have been provided to us in draft form, we have assumed that the
final executed versions of such documents will not differ materially from
such drafts.

  



  

Our opinion is also based on the accuracy of the following assumptions: (i)
the Company and Parent will each qualify as a REIT for the taxable period in
which the Merger is consummated, (ii) there will be no changes in the
applicable laws of the State of Maryland or the State of Delaware or of
any other jurisdiction under the laws of which any of the Company, Parent or
any of their subsidiaries have been formed or to which any of them are
subject, in any such case, that would have the effect of altering the facts
upon which the opinion set forth below is based, (iii) no action will be
taken by the Company, Parent or any of their subsidiaries after the date
hereof that would have the effect of altering facts upon which the opinion
set forth below is based, (iv) the Merger will be consummated in the
manner contemplated by, and in accordance with the provisions of, the Merger
Agreement and the Merger will be effective under the laws of State of
Maryland and the State of Delaware, (v) the Merger Agreement, the Form S-4 and
the other documents described in the Form S-4 represent the entire
understanding of the parties with respect to the Merger, and (vi) the parties
will report the Merger in a manner consistent with the opinion below and all
applicable reporting requirements pursuant to the Code and the
Regulations (as defined below) will be satisfied.

  



  

In rendering our opinion, we have considered and relied upon the Code, the
regulations promulgated thereunder (" _Regulations_ "), administrative rulings
and other Treasury interpretations of the Code and Regulations by the courts
and the IRS, all as they exist at the date hereof. It should be noted that
the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations
are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances, with
retroactive effect. A change that is made after the date hereof in any of the
foregoing could adversely affect our conclusions set forth herein. In this
regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents
counsel's best judgment as to the outcome on the merits with respect to such
issue, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and is not a guarantee that
the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect to such issue or that
a court will not sustain such a position if asserted by the IRS.

  



  

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications
stated herein, we are of the opinion that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

We express no opinion on any issue relating to the Merger, the Company,
Parent or any investment therein or with respect to any other federal tax
matters or to any issues arising under the tax laws of any other country, or
any state or locality, other than as expressly stated above. This opinion is
expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to, and we do
not intend to, supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any
legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof
or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement,
representation, covenant, or assumption relied upon herein that becomes
incorrect or untrue. This opinion has been prepared for you and it may not be
used or relied upon by anyone else other than the Company, nor may this letter
or any copies hereof be furnished to a third party, filed with a governmental
agency, quoted, cited or otherwise referred to without our prior written
consent.

 _Circular 230 Disclosure_

  



  

To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service, we hereby disclose that (i) any discussion of federal tax issues
contained or referred to in this opinion was not written, and cannot be used
for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed under the Code and
(ii) this opinion is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used,
for the purpose of promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any
transaction or matter addressed herein.
