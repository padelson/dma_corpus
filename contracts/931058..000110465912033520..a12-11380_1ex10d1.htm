account(s) designated by Seller, _less_ the Indemnity Escrow Deposit which

Agent_ "), Buyer shall deposit in escrow with the Escrow Agent in cash an
amount equal to $33,500,000 (the " _Escrow Deposit_ ") to be held by the
Escrow Agent in an escrow fund (the " _Escrow Deposit Fund_ ") pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Deposit Fund
shall be released to Seller in accordance with Section 10.5 hereof and to
Buyer in accordance with Section 10.7 hereof. In any event, all interest on,
or other proceeds of, the Escrow Deposit Fund shall accrue for the benefit of
Buyer until such time as the Escrow Deposit Fund is released, at which point
such interest or proceeds shall be released to Buyer regardless of whether
such release is made to Seller pursuant to Section 10.5 hereof or Buyer
pursuant to Section 10.7 hereof.

 



 

(b) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit with and transfer to the Escrow
Agent in immediately available funds an amount equal to $33,040,000 (the "
_Indemnity Escrow Deposit_ "). The Indemnity Escrow Deposit shall be held,
together with the "Indemnity Escrow Deposit" (as defined in the PBC APA), by
the Escrow Agent in an escrow fund (the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ ") pursuant
to this Agreement and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement for a period of twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date, except to the extent earlier released
to Seller as provided herein or to the Buyer Indemnified Parties (as defined
below) or the "Buyer Indemnified Parties" (as defined in the PBC APA), as
applicable, to satisfy any indemnity obligations of Seller or PBC Seller, as
applicable, to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Agreement or the
"Buyer Indemnified Parties" (as defined in the PBC APA) under the PBC APA, as
applicable, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Indemnity Escrow Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, on and as of
the date that is six (6) months following the Closing Date, Buyer, PBC Buyer,
Sellers and PBC Seller shall instruct Escrow Agent to release to Sellers (or
as directed by Sellers and PBC Seller) from the Indemnity Escrow Fund an
amount equal to the product of (1) (x) $16,750,000 less (y) the amount of any
claims by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for indemnification under this
Agreement or any claims by the "Buyer Indemnified Parties" (as defined in the
PBC APA) for indemnification under the PBC APA, as applicable, outstanding and
unpaid as of such date, if any, pursuant to the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement or the PBC APA, as applicable, and the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement and less (z) the sum of the amount of all unpaid
Closing Date Adjustments, if any, payable by Seller pursuant to Section 1.6
plus the amount of all unpaid "Closing Date Adjustments" (as defined in the
PBC APA), if any, payable by PBC Seller pursuant to Section 1.6 of the PBC
APA, multiplied by (2) the Applicable Seller Portion (as defined below). On
the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Buyer, PBC
Buyer, Sellers and PBC Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to
Sellers (or as directed by Sellers and PBC Seller) from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund an amount equal to the product of (i) (a) the amount of funds then held
by the Escrow Agent in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (including all interest
earned thereon and not including, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts
released prior to such date pursuant to the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement,

 



      
 

 



 

the PBC APA and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement) less (b) the amount of any
claims by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for indemnification under this
Agreement or any claims by the "Buyer Indemnified Parties" (as defined in the
PBC APA) for indemnification under the PBC APA, as applicable, outstanding and
unpaid as of such date, if any, pursuant to the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement or the PBC APA, as applicable, and the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement, multiplied by (ii) the Applicable Seller Portion.
Promptly following final and conclusive resolution of any such claims, the
Escrow Agent shall pay to the Buyer Indemnified Parties any amounts due to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties under Sellers indemnity set forth herein or shall
pay to the "Buyer Indemnified Parties" (as defined in the PBC APA) any amounts
due to such Buyer Indemnified Parties under PBC Sellers indemnity set forth
in the PBC APA and shall disburse to Seller (or as directed by Sellers and PBC
Seller) an amount equal to the product of (x) the remainder of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, if any, plus all accrued interest thereon, multiplied by (y) the
Applicable Seller Portion. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Applicable
Seller Portion_ " shall be equal to the proportion that the Purchase Price
payable pursuant to Section 1.4 bears to the sum of such Purchase Price plus
the "Purchase Price" (as defined in the PBC APA) payable pursuant to Section
1.4 of the PBC APA. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any obligations for which Seller is liable to Buyer under Section
1.6 of this Agreement or any Damages (as defined below) for which Seller is
liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under Article 9 of this Agreement
shall be first satisfied out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the Indemnity Escrow Fund covers indemnification
claims under both this Agreement and the PBC APA and that Section 1.5(b) of
the PBC APA shall work in concert with this Section 1.5(b).

 



 

1.6. _Prorations and Adjustments_. All income and expenses arising from the
Business, including, without limitation, Assumed Obligations and prepaid
expenses, ad valorem and property taxes and assessments (but excluding
Sellers Accounts Receivable), annual regulatory fees payable to the FCC,
power and utilities charges, and rents and similar prepaid and deferred items
(including deferred revenue) shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer in
accordance with GAAP to reflect the principle that Seller shall be entitled to
all income and be responsible for all expenses arising from the Business
through the Effective Time and Buyer shall be entitled to all income and be
responsible for all expenses arising from the Business after the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.6 to the contrary, (i) except
as set forth herein, with respect to Trade Agreements (as defined below) for
the sale of time for goods or services assumed by Buyer, if at the Effective
Time, the Trade Agreements have an aggregate negative balance (i.e., the
amount by which the value of air time the Stations are obligated to provide
after the Effective Time exceeds the fair market value of corresponding goods
and services to be received by the Stations after such date), there shall be
no proration or adjustment, unless the aggregate negative balance of the
Stations Trade Agreements exceeds $150,000, in which event such excess shall
be treated as prepaid time sales of Seller, and adjusted for as a proration in
Buyers favor, (ii) there shall be no proration under this Section 1.6 to the
extent there is an aggregate positive balance with respect to the Stations
Trade Agreements and (iii) there shall be no proration under this Section 1.6
for Program Rights (as defined below) agreements except to the extent that any
payments or performance due under such Program Rights agreements relate to a
payment period that straddles the Effective Time. For purposes of this
Agreement, (i) " _Trade Agreement_ " means any contract, agreement or
commitment, oral or written, other than film and program barter agreements,
pursuant to which Seller has agreed to sell or trade commercial air time or
commercial production services of a Station in consideration for any property
or service

 



      
 

 



 

in lieu of cash and (ii) " _Program Rights_ " means all rights of the Stations
to broadcast television programs or shows as part of the Stations
programming, including all film and program barter agreements, sports rights
agreements, news rights or service agreements, affiliation agreements and
syndication agreements. The prorations and adjustments to be made pursuant to
this Section 1.6 are referred to as the " _Closing Date Adjustments_." Three
(3) business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall estimate all Closing
Date Adjustments pursuant to this Section 1.6 and shall deliver a statement of
its estimates to Buyer (which statement shall set forth in reasonable detail
the basis for those estimates). At the Closing, the net amount due to Buyer or
Seller as a result of the estimated Closing Date Adjustments (excluding any
item that is in good faith dispute) shall be applied as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, as appropriate. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing,
Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement of any adjustments to Sellers
estimate of the Closing Date Adjustments, and no later than the close of
business on the 20th day after the delivery of such statements (the " _Payment
Date_ "), Buyer shall pay to Seller, or Seller shall pay to Buyer (which shall
be satisfied out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund), as the case may be, any amount
due as a result of the adjustment (or, if there is any good faith dispute, the
undisputed amount). Except with respect to items that Seller notifies Buyer
that it objects to prior to the close of business on the date that is at least
one (1) business day prior to the Payment Date, the adjustments set forth in
Buyers statement shall be final and binding on the parties effective at the
close of business on the Payment Date. If Seller disputes Buyers
determinations or Buyer disputes Sellers determinations, the parties shall
consult with regard to the matter and an appropriate adjustment and payment
shall be made as agreed upon by the parties within thirty (30) business days
after the Payment Date. If such thirty (30) business day consultation period
expires, and the dispute has not been resolved, then the parties shall select
a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized independent accounting firm that
does not then have a relationship with Seller or Buyer, or any of their
respective affiliates (the " _Independent Accountant_ "), to resolve the
disagreement and make a determination with respect thereto as promptly as
practicable; provided that if Seller and Buyer cannot agree, the Independent
Accountant shall be selected by an accounting firm designated by Buyer and an
accounting firm designated by Seller. The determination by the Independent
Accountant on the matter shall be binding. If an Independent Accountant is
engaged pursuant to this Section 1.6, the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant shall be borne by Seller and Buyer in inverse proportion as such
parties may prevail on the resolution of the disagreement which proportionate
allocation also will be determined by the Independent Accountant and be
included in the Independent Accountants written report, and an appropriate
adjustment and payment shall be made within three (3) business days of the
resolution by the Independent Accountant, which resolution shall be rendered
within thirty (30) business days after such submission.

 



 

1.7. _Allocation_. All amounts constituting consideration within the meaning
of and for the purposes of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the " _Code_ ") shall be allocated
among the Station Assets and any other rights acquired by Buyer hereunder, as
applicable, in the manner required by Section 1060 of the Code and, subject to
reasonable adjustments at or following the Closing to reflect changes in the
fair market value of the Station Assets occurring following the date hereof,
as set forth on __Schedule 1.7__.

(10) days prior written notice to Seller may waive the requirement that the
FCC Consent become a Final Order if, in connection therewith, the parties
execute and deliver at Closing a mutually acceptable unwind agreement relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Unwind Agreement_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the Closing occur prior to
August 1, 2012.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 1.8(a)(i) above, if the Marketing Period (as
defined below) has not ended as of the Primary Closing Date, then the Closing
shall occur instead on the date that is the earliest to occur of (A) any
business day before or during the Marketing Period as may be specified by
Buyer on no less than five (5) business days prior notice to Seller and (B)
the business day immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period,

twenty (20) consecutive business days after the date hereof throughout which
(i) Buyer shall have the Required Financial Information (as defined herein)

the conditions to Closing set forth in Article 7 of this Agreement (other than
the conditions set forth in Section 7.3 and Section 7.6 and those conditions
that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing) to fail to be
satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such
twenty (20) consecutive business day period; _provided_ , that, without
Buyers consent, in no event shall the Marketing Period be deemed to begin
prior to the later of receipt of the HSR Clearance and the initial grant of
the FCC Consent (irrespective of whether such FCC Consent shall have become a

provide to the other parties a copy of any pleading, order or other document
served on it relating to the FCC Application or the FCC Consent, and Buyer and
Seller shall each oppose any petitions to deny or other objections filed with
respect to the FCC Application and any requests for reconsideration or review

diligently prosecute the FCC Application and otherwise use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as soon as possible; _provided_ ,
_however_ , except as provided in Section 11.1 hereof, neither Buyer nor
Seller shall be required to pay consideration to any third party to obtain the
FCC Consent. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Final Order_ " means an Action

period thereunder), and shall thereafter promptly respond to all requests
received from such agencies for additional information or documentation and
otherwise diligently take, or cooperate in the taking of, all actions
necessary to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
decree, order or judgment under the HSR Act that would restrain, prevent or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the PBC APA on or before the Outside Date (as defined below), including by
defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by
any governmental agency or third party and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under the HSR Act that may be asserted by any governmental
agency with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
PBC APA so as to enable the consummation of such transactions to occur as soon

Application_ ") must be filed pursuant to the FCC Rules (as defined below),
Seller shall timely execute, file and prosecute with the FCC such Renewal
Application in accordance with Section 4.1(b) hereof. If the FCC Application
is granted by the FCC subject to a renewal condition, then, without limitation
of Section 1.9(a), the term "FCC Consent" shall be deemed to also include the
satisfaction of such renewal condition. In order to avoid disruption or delay
in the processing of the FCC Application, Buyer agrees, as a part of the FCC
Application, to request that the FCC apply its policy permitting the
assignment of FCC Licenses in transactions involving multiple stations to
proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of one or more Renewal Applications.
Buyer agrees to make such representations and undertakings as are necessary or
appropriate to invoke such policy, including undertakings to assume, as
between the parties and the FCC, the position of the applicant before the FCC
with respect to any pending Renewal Application and to assume the
corresponding regulatory risks relating to any such Renewal Application;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing set forth in this Section 1.9(c) shall
be deemed to amend or modify the provisions of Section 1.3 relating to the
Retained Obligations. In addition, and exclusive of any agreements that Seller
enters into pursuant to Section 4.1(r) hereof, Buyer acknowledges that, to the
extent reasonably necessary to expedite grant by the FCC of any Renewal
Application and thereby to facilitate grant of the FCC Application, Seller
shall be permitted to enter into such additional tolling agreements with the
FCC to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a
forfeiture penalty against a Station in connection with (i) any pending
complaints that such Station aired programming that contained obscene,
indecent or profane material, (ii) any FCC inquiry regarding a Stations
broadcast of certain video news release or satellite media tour material, or
(iii) any other enforcement matters against a Station with respect to which
the FCC may permit

 



      
 

 



 

Seller to enter into a tolling agreement. Buyer and Seller shall consult in
good faith with each other prior to Seller entering into any such tolling
agreement under this Section 1.9(c).

 



 

(d) In connection with their obligations pursuant to this Section 1.9 with
respect to pursuing the FCC Consent and the HSR Clearance, Buyer and Seller
shall (i) keep each other informed in all material respects and on a
reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any governmental agency and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any Action by a private
party, in each case with respect to this Agreement, the Stations or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) notify each other of all documents
filed with or received from any governmental agency with respect to this
Agreement, the Stations or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) furnish
each other with such information and assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with their preparation of any governmental filing
hereunder and (iv) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any filing or submission with a governmental agency in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before any governmental agency relating
to this Agreement, the Stations or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any Action initiated by a private party. Subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of Buyer and Seller shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult with the other on, all information relating to the other party or
parties, as the case may be, and their respective affiliates, that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any governmental agency with respect to this Agreement, the Stations or
the transactions contemplated hereby. The FCC Consent and HSR Clearance are
referred to herein collectively as the " _Governmental Consents_ ".

employees, directors, or natural persons or service providers of Seller or any

favorable determination letter, and, to Sellers knowledge, nothing has
occurred subsequent to the date of such favorable determination letter that
could adversely affect the qualified status of any such plan.

broadcast industry generally, (iii) Seller has not received any written notice
from any governmental agency to the effect that Seller is not in compliance
with any laws, ordinances,

respects with the past practice of Seller with respect to financial statements
for similar interim reporting periods, (y) the parties acknowledge that such
Q1 Statements are subject, following the date hereof, to auditor review and
modifications based thereon and (z) following such auditor review, the final
versions of such Q1 Statements shall be provided to Buyer and shall be deemed

regard to the provisos set forth in this sentence. The books and records of
Seller are consistent in all material respects with the Financial Statements.
Except as required by GAAP, Seller has not, between the last day of its most
recently ended fiscal year and the date of this Agreement, made or adopted any

such last day of its most recently ended fiscal year. Since October 1, 2009,
Seller has not had any material dispute with any of its auditors regarding
accounting matters or policies that is currently outstanding or that resulted
(or would reasonably be expected to result) in an adjustment to, or any
restatement of, the Financial Statements. No current or former independent

Buyer enforceable in accordance with its terms, except in each case as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, moratorium, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws affecting or limiting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and except as such enforceability is subject to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

3.3. _No Conflicts_. Except for the Governmental Consents, the execution,
delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the Buyer Ancillary
Agreements and the consummation by Buyer of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby does not and will not conflict with, violate,
result in a breach of the terms and conditions of, or, with or without notice
or the passage of time, result in any breach, event of default or the creation
of any lien under, any lease, contract or agreement to which Buyer is a party
or to which its assets are subject, any organizational documents of Buyer, or
any law, judgment, order or decree to which Buyer is subject, or require the
consent or approval of, or a filing by Buyer with, any governmental or
regulatory authority or any third party (other than required filings with the

3.5. _Qualification_. Buyer is legally, financially and otherwise qualified to
be the licensee of, acquire, own and operate the Stations under the
Communications Laws, and knows of no facts that would, under existing law and
the FCC Rules, disqualify Buyer as an assignee of the FCC Licenses or as the
owner and operator of the Stations. Other than the Satellite Waiver, no waiver
of or exemption from any FCC rule or policy on the part of Buyer is necessary
for the FCC Consent to be obtained. To Buyers knowledge, there are no matters
relating to Buyers FCC qualifications that might reasonably be expected to
result in the FCCs denial or material

 



      
 

 



 

delay of approval of the FCC Application. From the date hereof through the

acknowledges and agrees that the obligation of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not conditioned upon the
closing of the Financing, Buyers receipt of the proceeds of the Financing or
Buyers ability to finance or pay the Purchase Price and that any failure of
Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a
result of the foregoing or otherwise shall constitute a material breach by
Buyer of this Agreement giving rise to Sellers right to terminate this
Agreement under Section 10.1(c) hereof and entitle Seller to receive the
Escrow Deposit Fund (including, if applicable, attorneys fees and costs)
pursuant to Section 10.5.

 



 

3.7. _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions in Article 7

third party consents necessary for the assignment of any Station Contract or
Real Property Lease (which shall not require any payment to any such third
party), and (ii) estoppel certificates reasonably acceptable to Buyer from
lessors under any Real Property Leases requiring consent to assignment (if
any), but no such third party consents or estoppel certificates are conditions
to Closing except for the Required Consents (as defined on __Schedule 5.5(a)__
).

 



 

(b) To the extent that any Station Contract or Real Property Lease may not be
assigned without the consent of any third party, and such consent is not
obtained prior to Closing, this Agreement and any assignment executed pursuant
to this Agreement shall not constitute an assignment of such Station Contract
or Real Property Lease; _provided_ , _however_ , with respect to each such
Station Contract and Real Property Lease, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to
the extent feasible in effecting a lawful and commercially reasonable
arrangement under which Buyer shall receive the benefits under the Station
Contract and Real Property Lease from and after Closing, and to the extent of
the benefits received, Buyer shall pay and perform Sellers obligations
arising under the Station Contract and Real Property from and after Closing in
accordance with its terms.

 



      
 

 



 

5.6. _Environmental_. Within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, Buyer
may, at its option and at its cost and expense, perform Phase I environmental
assessments of the Owned Real Property and, subject to any required prior
written approval of the owner or lessor, of the Real Property subject to Real
Property Leases. To the extent the consultant performing such assessment
advises Buyer in writing that a Phase II assessment should be conducted with
respect to any parcel of Owned Real Property, Buyer may conduct such Phase II
assessment at its cost and expense within thirty (30) days after Buyer
receives the results from the Phase I in writing. If any environmental
condition with respect to the Real Property is discovered as a result of such
assessments or otherwise that would require correction or remediation under
existing applicable Environmental Laws, Seller shall, at its cost and expense,
correct and remediate such conditions to bring the Real Property into
compliance with such laws; provided that if the Phase II indicates that
remediation is required, Buyer shall obtain a cost estimate for this work
prior to the commencement of any remediation; and provided further that Seller
shall have no obligation to correct or remediate any environmental condition
if such correction or remediation of the environmental condition is a
landlords, lessors or other third partys primary responsibility. Seller
shall be responsible, in the aggregate with respect to the Owned Real Property
and to the "Owned Real Property" as defined in the PBC APA, for any
remediation costs up to $2,000,000 (the " _Remediation Amount_ "). If remedial
costs and expenses are estimated to exceed the Remediation Amount, Buyer shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1(g)
hereof upon ten (10) days written notice to Seller unless Seller is willing
and elects to be responsible for any such costs and expenses in excess of such
Remediation Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such costs and expenses
are estimated to exceed $10,000,000 **** (the " _Excess Remediation Amount_
"), Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 10.1(g) hereof upon ten (10) days notice to Seller irrespective of
whether or not Seller is willing and elects to be responsible for such costs
and expenses in excess of such Remediation Amount and Excess Remediation
Amount. **** No environmental remediation shall delay the Closing, and to the
extent remediation is required to be performed after the Closing, Sellers
representations and warranties shall be modified at Closing to account for any
conditions required to be remediated post-Closing, and the parties shall enter
into a post-Closing environmental remediation agreement, negotiated in good
faith by the parties, consistent with the provisions of this Section 5.6 to
address such post-Closing remediation. Buyer shall repair any damage and
indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any Damages arising from the entry by
Buyer or its employees, agents or contractors upon the Real Property.

 



 

5.7. _Employees_.

 



 

(a) Seller has provided Buyer a list showing employee names, positions and
annualized pay rates (including wages, salaries and commission rates) for all
employees of Seller engaged directly in the Business (the " _Station
Employees_ "), it being understood that any employee of Seller whose principal
work location is at the corporate headquarters of Networks (or any of its
parent entities) or whose employment responsibilities relate substantially to
the corporate operations of any Seller or the business and operations of
substantially all of the Stations taken as a whole **** shall be deemed not a
Station Employee for any purpose hereunder. Seller shall update that list no
later than thirty (30) **** days prior to Closing (provided that Buyer
provides Seller with reasonable advance written notice of the Closing Date),
and shall provide Buyer with such other information in Sellers possession as
Buyer may reasonably request. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer
employment effective as of the Closing to each of such

 



      
 

 



 

Station Employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that such offers shall be subject
to proof evidencing a legal right to work in the United States and, subject to
this Section 5.7, shall offer employment on terms substantially comparable in
the aggregate to what Seller provided immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Assuming acceptance of Buyers employment offer by the applicable Station
Employee, such employment offer shall supersede any prior agreements and other
arrangements with such Station Employee in effect prior to the Closing Date,
with the exception of any written employment agreement with any such Station
Employee in effect as of the Closing Date (and not entered into or amended in
violation of Section 4.1), and Buyer shall assume Sellers obligations under
each such written employment agreement. Station Employees whose employment
with Seller terminates and who accept such offers of employment by Buyer (or
its affiliates) in accordance with this Section 5.7 are referred to
collectively herein as the " _Transferred Employees_ ". As of the Closing
Date, Seller shall (i) terminate or shall cause the termination of the
employment of all Transferred Employees and (ii) except as set forth in this
Section 5.7, pay to all Transferred Employees all amounts due to such
Transferred Employees relating to or arising out of their employment or
termination of employment, including any compensation (including accrued and
unpaid wages) due such Transferred Employees, if any, and benefits accrued by
the Transferred Employees under the Seller Employee Benefit Plans; _provided_
, _however_ , that, except as set forth on __Schedule 5.7(a)__ , Buyer shall
be solely liable for any severance payment required to be made to any
Transferred Employee in connection with the termination of such Transferred
Employees employment with Seller or Buyer as contemplated by this Section
5.7. Nothing in this Section 5.7 is intended to or shall require Buyer to
continue to employ any Transferred Employee for any period of time following
the Closing or to continue to maintain any term or condition of employment or
otherwise to treat any such employee on any basis other than as an employee-
at-will (subject to the terms of any employment contract or collective
bargaining agreement assumed by Buyer).

 



 

(b) At the Closing, subject to applicable law, Buyer will assume all
liabilities and obligations of Seller with respect to (i) all unused sick time
as of the Closing Date for the Transferred Employees that is used by such
Transferred Employees after December 31, 2012 (it being understood that all
unused sick time as of the Closing Date for the Transferred Employees that is
used by such Transferred Employees prior to December 31 of the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs shall be a Retained Obligation) and (ii) each of
the matters set forth on __Schedule 5.7(b)__ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
with respect to the matters set forth on __Schedule 5.7(b)__ , the aggregate
amount of all such liabilities and obligations shall be credited to Buyer in
full for purposes of calculating the Closing Date Adjustments pursuant to
Section 1.6. In connection with Sellers delivery to Buyer of its statement of
estimated Closing Date Adjustments pursuant to Section 1.6, Seller shall
update __Schedule 5.7(b)_ _as necessary to reflect the then-current balances
of all such liabilities and obligations.

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, from and after the Closing,
(i) Sellers shall assume or retain, as the case may be, and be solely
responsible for all liabilities arising under, resulting from or relating to
the Seller Employee Benefit Plans or Sellers employment of or termination of
its employees, whether incurred before, on or after the Closing Date and (ii)
Buyer shall be solely responsible for all liabilities arising under, resulting
from or relating to Buyers employment or termination of the Transferred
Employees.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) For purposes of Buyers "employee welfare benefit plans" (including health
insurance plans) and "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section
3(1) and 3(2) of ERISA, respectively), Transferred Employees (and their
spouses and dependents) shall be credited with prior service with Seller for
purposes of eligibility and waiver of any pre-existing condition exclusions in
accordance with Buyers insurance contracts. Except as otherwise expressly set
forth herein, Buyer shall have no responsibility for any claims incurred under
any employee welfare plans of Seller.

 



 

(e) Buyer shall also permit each Transferred Employee who participates in
Sellers 401(k) plan to elect to make direct rollovers of their account
balances into Buyers 401(k) plan as of Closing (or as soon as practicable
thereafter when Buyers 401(k) plan is capable of accepting such rollovers),
including the direct rollover of any outstanding loan balances such that they
will continue to make payments under the terms of such loans under Buyers
401(k) plan, subject to compliance with applicable law and subject to the
reasonable requirements of Buyers 401(k) plan. Buyers 401(k) plan shall
credit Transferred Employees with service credit for eligibility and vesting
purposes for service recognized for the equivalent purposes under Sellers
401(k) plan.

 



 

(f) In accordance with Treasury Regulation §54.4980B 9, QandA 7, Seller shall be
and is solely responsible for coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended and the rules and regulations issued
thereunder (" _COBRA_ "), for all MandA qualified beneficiaries (determined in
accordance with Treasury Regulation §54.4980B-9, QandA 4). Seller shall take all
steps that may be necessary, including arranging for continued group health
plan coverage for the COBRA statutory coverage period for each MandA qualified
beneficiary, to ensure that such COBRA continuation coverage is available to
such individuals and to ensure that the provisions of Treasury Regulation
§54.4980B-9, QandA 8(c) do not become applicable at any time, and to prevent
Buyer from becoming, by operation of such regulation section or otherwise, a
"successor employer" for purposes of COBRA coverage. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for offering and providing any COBRA coverage required with
respect to any Transferred Employees (or other qualified beneficiary) who
becomes covered by any welfare benefit plans maintained by Buyer. For purposes
hereof, each of "qualified beneficiary", "MandA qualified beneficiaries" and
"group health plan" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 4980B
of the Code and the related regulations.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.7, the parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that (i) this Agreement is not intended to
create a contract between Buyer, Seller and or any of their respective
affiliates on the one hand and any employee of Seller on the other hand, and
no employee of Seller may rely on this Agreement as the basis for any breach
of contract claim against Buyer or Seller, (ii) nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed or construed to require Buyer to continue to employ any
particular employee of Seller for any period after Closing, (iii) nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to limit Buyers right to
terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee during any period after
the Closing Date and (iv) nothing in this Agreement shall establish, modify or
amend any Seller Employee Benefit Plan.

 



 

5.8. _Accounting Services; Access to and Retention of Records_. During the
first sixty (60) business days after Closing, Buyer shall provide to Seller at
no additional cost the

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable services of the Stations business offices, together with
reasonable access to related systems and records, for the purposes of closing
the books of the Stations for the period prior to Closing, all substantially
in accordance with the procedures and practices applied by Sellers business
offices for periods prior to Closing. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall preserve, in accordance with Buyers normal document retention
procedures and practices, all books and records transferred by Seller to Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement and shall provide Seller a reasonable opportunity
to access and obtain copies, at Sellers expense, of any such books and
records. In addition to the foregoing, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall
afford to Seller, and its counsel, accountants, and other authorized agents
and representatives, at Sellers expense, during normal business hours,
reasonable access to the employees, books, records and other data relating to
the Station Assets, the Assumed Obligations, or the Transferred Employees in
its possession with respect to the periods prior to Closing, and the right to
make copies and extracts therefrom, to the extent that such access may be
reasonably required by Seller (a) to facilitate the investigation, litigation
and final disposition of any claims which may have been or may be made against
Seller, (b) for the preparation of Tax Returns and audits and (c) for any
other reasonable and proper business purpose, provided in each case that such
access does not unreasonably disrupt the business and operations of the
Stations or of Buyer.

 



 

5.9. _Reasonable Efforts_. In furtherance (and not in limitation) of the
provisions set forth in this Agreement, at all times prior to Closing, Buyer
and Seller shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take
or cause to be taken all action necessary or desirable in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is practicable.

 



 

5.10. _Title Insurance; Survey_.

 



 

(a) _Title Insurance_.

 



 

(i) Buyer may elect to procure title insurance policies for the Real Property
and obtain a preliminary title report which contains a commitment (the "
_Title Commitment_ ") of a title company to issue one or more (as appropriate)
owners or lessees title insurance policy on ALTA Owners or Lessees Policy
(and corresponding mortgagees policies) (each, a " _Title Policy_ " and
collectively, the " _Title Policies_ ") insuring the fee simple or leasehold
interest of Buyer in such parcels of Real Property. Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Buyer to obtain copies of all documents, filings and
information disclosed in the Title Commitment and Title Policy.

 



 

(ii) If Buyer has an objection to any exception noted on the Title Commitment
or the scope of coverage provided thereunder (other than Permitted Liens as to
which Buyer shall have no right to object) and if the failure to cure such
objection or defect would cause the Real Property to be unsuitable or
unavailable for its current use, Buyer may notify Seller of such objection or
defect within twenty (20) days of Buyers receipt of the Title Commitment and
Survey (as defined below) and Seller shall, prior to the Closing Date, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such objection or defect. Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer to obtain a Title
Policy for the Real Property and shall provide or assist in the procurement of
any and all affidavits or instruments customarily and reasonably required to
obtain a Title Policy on each of the properties that comprise the Real

 



      
 

 



 

Property. All standard exceptions which can be deleted by the use of owners
or sellers affidavits are to be deleted from the Title Commitment and Title
Policies, and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in executing and
delivering such instruments to the title insurance companies. Additionally, to
the extent that the title insurance companies selected by Buyer require
delivery of certain title clearance documents, including consents, approvals,
estoppels or memorandums of leases in order to insure Buyers leasehold
interest with respect to the leased Real Property, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with any applicable landlord
under the leases to allow Buyer to obtain a Title Policy for each of the
leased Real Property parcels. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not
be obligated to make any payment, incur any fees or costs (other than its own
attorneys fees) or satisfy any precondition to obtain such items.

 



 

(iii) The expenses incurred to obtain the Title Commitments and the Title
Policies shall be paid by Buyer.

 



 

(b) _Survey_.

 



 

(i) Buyer may obtain an as-built survey of the Real Property (the " _Survey_
") as of a date subsequent to the date hereof which shall (x) be prepared by a
registered land surveyor, (y) be certified to the title company, Buyers
lender and Buyer and (z) show with respect to the Real Property (A) the legal
description of such parcel of Real Property, (B) all buildings, structures and
improvements thereon and all restrictions of record and other restrictions
that have been established by an applicable zoning or building code or
ordinance and all easements or rights of way and (C) no encroachments upon
such parcel or adjoining parcels by buildings, structures or improvements
(unless valid easements or leases have been obtained with respect thereto or
unless such encroachments constitute a Permitted Lien). Any restrictions,
encroachments (onto the Real Property or from the Real Property onto adjoining
property) or other claims that are not Permitted Liens which materially affect
the intended use of the Real Property as disclosed on the Survey shall be a "
_Survey Defect_ " and if Buyer shall have an objection to such Survey with
respect to a Survey Defect and if the failure to cure such defect would cause
the Real Property to be unsuitable or unavailable for its current use, Buyer
shall notify Seller of such objection within twenty (20) days of Buyers
receipt of the Survey and the Title Commitment and Seller shall, prior to the
Closing Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such objection or
Survey Defect.

 



 

(ii) Prior to obtaining the Surveys on the leased Real Property, Buyer shall
obtain the consent of the fee owner of such leased Real Property. Seller
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in
obtaining such consent and conducting such surveys, including providing access
to Buyer and its representatives as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) The expenses incurred to obtain the Surveys shall be paid by Buyer. All
inspections and assessments conducted in connection with the procurement of
the Surveys shall be performed in a manner that will not unduly or
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Stations or the use of,
access to or egress from the Real Property, and Buyer shall repair any damage
and indemnify and hold harmless Seller from any Damages arising from the entry
by Buyer or its employees, agents or contractors upon the Real Property.

 



      
 

 



 

5.11. _Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable_.

 



 

(a) On or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later
than ten (10) business days after the end of the calendar month in which the
Closing occurs, Seller will deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth the
outstanding accounts receivable of Seller as of the Effective Time (the "
_Accounts Receivable_ ") and the outstanding accounts payable, including
unpaid commissions due to Station Employees and national sales representatives
of Seller as of the Effective Time arising out of the Business (the "
_Accounts Payable_ ").

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and provisions in this Section 5.11, Buyer will
collect the Accounts Receivable in the same manner and with the same diligence
that Buyer uses to collect its own accounts receivable for a period of ninety
(90) calendar days following the Closing Date (the " _Collection Period_ ").
Buyer will not be obligated to, and without the prior written consent of
Seller will not, institute litigation, employ any collection agency, legal
counsel, or other third party, or take any other extraordinary means of
collections or pay any expenses to third parties to collect the Accounts
Receivable, and subject to its compliance with the provisions of this Section
5.11, Buyer shall incur no liability whatsoever for any uncollected Accounts
Receivable. All amounts collected by Buyer after the Closing from an account
debtor will be applied first to the Accounts Receivable of such account debtor
in the order of their origination, unless the account debtor disputes such
Accounts Receivable or designates payment of a different Accounts Receivable
in writing. If during the Collection Period a dispute arises with regard to an
account included among the Accounts Receivable, Buyer shall promptly advise
Seller thereof and may (or, if requested by Seller, shall) return that account
to Seller. Buyer shall not issue any credit or accommodation against any
Accounts Receivable without the prior written consent of Seller.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall pay within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of the
month of receipt of such Accounts Receivable, commissions due to Station
Employees and national sales representatives (unless already paid) (the " _Net
Receivables_ ") as applicable (any payment to national sales representatives
shall be reconciled to actual collections).

 



 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.11, during the Collection
Period, Buyer will use the Net Receivables collected to pay the Accounts
Payable in a timely manner, _provided_ , _however_ , Buyer has no obligation
to use its own funds in excess of the Net Receivables to pay Accounts Payable.
Within twenty (20) calendar days after the end of each month during the
Collection Period, Buyer will deliver to Seller a written report with respect
to (i) the collections made with respect to the Accounts Receivable, (ii) the
calculation of Net Receivables and (iii) payments remitted with respect to the
Accounts Payable together with a copy of the invoices therefor. Such report
shall be accompanied by a payment to Seller of the amount by which the
collected Net Receivables paid during such month exceed the amount of the
Accounts Payable during such month.

 



 

(e) Within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of the Collection Period,
Buyer shall deliver to Seller a final written report (" _Final Report_ ")
which report shall be accompanied by a final payment to Seller of the amount
by which the Net Receivables collected during the Collection Period exceeded
the amount paid in respect of the Accounts Payable during the Collection
Period less any interim amounts theretofor remitted to Seller. The Final
Report

 



      
 

 



 

shall contain (i) a statement of accounts for each account prepared
substantially in the manner in which the Stations have heretofore prepared
such report, (ii) copies of all open Accounts Receivable invoices, (iii)
copies of all invoices for Accounts Payable received by the Stations after the
Closing Date for periods ending on or before the Closing Date and (iv) a
Accounts Receivable aging report for the Stations. Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the Final Report to Seller in an
electronic format.

 



 

(f) Following the expiration of the Collection Period, Buyer shall have no
further obligations pursuant to this Section 5.11, except to remit to Seller
any amounts received by Buyer which can be specifically identified as a
payment on account of any Accounts Receivable will be promptly paid over or
forwarded to Seller.

 



 

(g) All amounts due to Seller or Buyer under this Section 5.11 that are not
paid in accordance with the provisions hereof shall bear interest until paid
at a rate per annum equal to the generally prevailing prime interest rate (as
reported by The Wall Street Journal). The parties acknowledge and agree that
Accounts Receivable collected by Buyer for Seller pursuant to this Section
5.11 shall not be subject to a right of offset for any claim by Buyer against
Seller.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.11, the parties
acknowledge and agree that Buyer shall not assume, or in any way become liable
for, any liabilities or obligations of Seller of any kind or nature with
respect to the Accounts Payable. Buyer shall have no obligation to make
payment respecting any Accounts Payable, if at such time, Accounts Payable
exceed the amount of collected Net Receivables. If at any time or from time to
time during the Collection Period the amount owing in respect of any Accounts
Payable exceeds the amount of available collected Net Receivables, Buyer will
promptly notify Seller of such deficit and Seller shall thereafter pay to
Buyer such difference within twenty (20) calendar days after the delivery to
Seller of such notice. If Seller shall not pay the deficit to Buyer within the
time period specified, Buyer shall have the option in its sole discretion to
pay such deficit, and Seller shall thereafter reimburse Buyer immediately for
such amount, including interest at the rate set forth in Section 5.11(g)
above.

ARTICLE 9 _ 
SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

9.1. _Survival_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall
survive Closing for a period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date
whereupon they shall expire and be of no further force or effect, except that
(i) the representations and warranties of Seller contained in Section 2.1 and
Section 2.2 shall survive in perpetuity, (ii) the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in Section 2.5 shall survive until the
expiration of any applicable statute of limitations, (iii) the representations
and warranties of Buyer contained in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 shall survive
in perpetuity and (iv) if within such period the indemnified party gives the
indemnifying party written notice of a claim for breach thereof describing in
reasonable detail the nature and basis of such claim, then such claim,
together with all related indemnification obligations of the applicable party
hereto pursuant to this Article 9, shall survive until the earlier of
resolution of such claim or expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations.

 



 

9.2. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 9.2(b), from and after Closing, Sellers, jointly and
severally, shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its affiliates
and each of their respective officers, directors, managers, employees and
authorized agents (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any
and all losses, costs, damages, taxes, liabilities and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses (collectively, " _Damages_ ") incurred
by the Buyer Indemnified Parties, whether or not resulting from third party
claims, arising out of or resulting from:

 



 

(i) any breach by Seller of its representations and warranties made under this
Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) any default by Seller of any covenant or agreement made in this
Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) the Retained Obligations.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else herein to the contrary,
after Closing, (i) Seller shall have no liability to Buyer under Section
9.2(a)(i) unless the Aggregate Damages (as defined below) exceed $1,000,000,
at which time the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be held
harmless, indemnified against and compensated, reimbursed and paid for the
full amount of all Aggregate Damages suffered or incurred in excess of
$500,000 and (ii) the maximum liability of Seller under Section 9.2(a)(i)
shall be an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, it being understood
that in the event that the Indemnity

 



      
 

 



 

Escrow Fund is insufficient to pay any Buyer Indemnified Party any amounts
owed to such Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i), the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to collect any remaining amounts not
satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Fund and none of Seller or its affiliates
shall have any liability for any such deficiency. The parties acknowledge and
agree that the amounts set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section
9.2(b) and clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 9.2(b) of the PBC APA are aggregate
amounts, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement and the PBC APA and apply to
indemnification claims under both this Agreement and the PBC APA and that
Section 9.2(b) of the PBC APA shall work in concert with this Section 9.2(b).
As used herein, " _Aggregate Damages_ " means the sum of all Damages incurred
by any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to Section 9.2(a)(i) of
this Agreement and by any of the "Buyer Indemnified Parties" (as defined in
the PBC APA) with respect to Section 9.2(a)(i) of the PBC APA.

 



 

(c) From and after Closing, Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Seller and its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors,
managers, employees and authorized agents (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_
") from and against any and all Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified
Parties, whether or not resulting from third party claims, arising out of or
resulting from:

 



 

(i) any breach by Buyer of its representations and warranties made under this
Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) any default by Buyer of any covenant or agreement made in this Agreement;
or

 



 

(iii) the Assumed Obligations.

 



 

(d) The right to indemnification under this Article 9 based upon such
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations shall not be affected
by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification or any other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations.

 



 

9.3. _Procedures with Respect to Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) The indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to the indemnifying
party of any demand, suit, claim or assertion of liability by third parties
that is subject to indemnification hereunder (a " _Claim_ "), but a failure to
give such notice or delaying such notice shall not affect the indemnified
partys rights or the indemnifying partys obligations except to the extent
the indemnifying partys ability to remedy, contest, defend or settle with
respect to such Claim is thereby materially prejudiced and provided that,
where applicable, such notice is given within the time period described in
Section 9.1.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The indemnifying party shall have the right to undertake the defense or
opposition to such Claim with counsel selected by it. In the event that the
indemnifying party elects not to undertake such defense or opposition or does
not undertake such defense or opposition in a timely manner, the indemnified
party may undertake the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of such
Claim with counsel selected by it at the indemnifying partys cost, except
that the indemnified party shall not, without the indemnifying partys written
consent, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to entry of any judgment
which does not include the giving by the claimant to the indemnifying party of
a release from all liability in respect of such Claim.

 



 

(c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding:

 



 

(i) the indemnified party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense,
to participate in the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of the
Claim;

 



 

(ii) the indemnifying party shall not, without the indemnified partys written
consent, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to entry of any judgment
which does not include the giving by the claimant to the indemnified party of
a release from all liability in respect of such Claim; and

 



 

(iii) in the event that the indemnifying party undertakes defense of or
opposition to any Claim, the indemnified party, by counsel or other
representative of its own choosing and at its sole cost and expense, shall
have the right to consult with the indemnifying party and its counsel
concerning such Claim and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and
their respective counsel shall cooperate in good faith with respect to such
Claim.

 



 

9.4. _Indemnity Escrow Fund_. Immediately upon the consummation of the
Closing, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow Deposit will be deposited with the Escrow
Agent to be held as part of the Indemnity Escrow Fund serving as collateral
security for Sellers obligations under Section 1.6 hereof, Sellers
obligations to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Article 9,
PBC Sellers obligations to indemnify the "Buyer Indemnified Parties" (as
defined in the PBC APA) under Article 9 of the PBC APA and for PBC Sellers
obligations under Section 1.6 of the PBC APA. The Indemnity Escrow Fund will
be administered in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

 



 

9.5. _Exclusive Remedies_. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that, if the
Closing occurs, the indemnification provisions of this Article 9 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of Buyer and Seller for any breach of the
representations or warranties or nonperformance of or default under any
covenants or agreements of Buyer or Seller contained in this Agreement or any
Buyer Ancillary Agreements or Seller Ancillary Agreements, and neither party
shall have any liability to the other party under any circumstances for
special, indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, or lost
profits, diminution in value or any damages based on any type of multiple of
earnings of any indemnified party; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall relieve or limit the liability of any party
from any liability or Damages arising out of or resulting from such partys
fraud in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the
Seller Ancillary Agreements or the Buyer Ancillary Agreements.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE 10 _ 
TERMINATION AND REMEDIES_

 



 

10.1. _Termination_. Subject to Section 10.3, this Agreement may be terminated
prior to Closing as follows:

 



 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller;

 



 

(b) by written notice of Buyer to Seller if Seller or PBC Seller breaches any
of its representations or warranties or defaults in the performance of any of
its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or the PBC APA, as the
case may be, and such breach or default is material (as to the Stations, taken
as a whole) in the context of the transactions contemplated hereby or under
the PBC APA and is not cured within the Cure Period (as defined below) or
"Cure Period" (as defined under the PBC APA);

 



 

(c) by written notice of Seller to Buyer if Buyer or PBC Buyer breaches any of
its representations or warranties or defaults in the performance of any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or the PBC APA, as the
case may be, and such breach or default is material in the context of the
transactions contemplated hereby or under the PBC APA and is not cured within
the Cure Period or "Cure Period" (as defined under the PBC APA); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Cure Period shall not apply to Buyers obligations to pay
the Purchase Price at Closing in the circumstances where all of the conditions
to Buyers obligations to consummate the Closing (other than those under
Article 7 to be performed at Closing) have been satisfied or waived;

 



 

(d) subject to __Schedule 1.8__ , by written notice of Seller to Buyer or
Buyer to Seller if Closing does not occur on or before the nine (9) month
anniversary of the date hereof (such date, the " _Outside Date_ "), except if
the failure of the Closing to occur is the result of an act or omission by
such terminating party who is in breach of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Outside Date shall be extended as follows: (i) if the FCC
Consent has been granted prior to the nine (9) month anniversary of the date
hereof, but has not become a Final Order as of such date, the Outside Date
shall be deemed to be the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date hereof;
and (ii) if, as of the nine (9) month anniversary of the date hereof, there
are one or more petitions to deny, petitions for reconsideration or informal
objections that have been filed with the FCC and that challenge or request the
denial of the FCC Application, reconsideration of the FCC Consent or otherwise
seek a condition upon the grant of the FCC Consent, the Outside Date shall be
deemed to be the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date hereof; and
_provided_ _further_ that, for purposes of this Section 10.1(d), the terms
"FCC Application" and "FCC Consent" shall have both the meanings ascribed to
such terms in this Agreement and the meanings ascribed to such terms in the
PBC APA;

 



 

(e) by written notice of Seller to Buyer if "Closing" (as defined in the PBC
APA) does not occur on or before the Outside Date, except if the failure of
the "Closing" (as defined in the PBC APA) to occur is the result of an act or
omission by "Seller" (as defined in the PBC APA) who is in breach of the PBC
APA;

 



      
 

 



 

(f) by written notice of Buyer to Seller if "Closing" (as defined in the PBC
APA) does not occur on or before the Outside Date, except if the failure of
the "Closing" (as defined in the PBC APA) to occur is the result of an act or
omission by "Buyer" (as defined in the PBC APA) who is in breach of the PBC
APA;

 



 

(g) as provided in Section 5.4 or Section 5.6; or

 



 

(h) by written notice of Seller to Buyer or Buyer to Seller upon the
termination of the PBC APA in accordance with its terms, except that this
Section 10.1(h) shall not apply if this Agreement could otherwise be
terminated by a party pursuant to Section 10.1(b) or Section 10.1(c) above.

 



 

10.2. _Cure Period_. Each party shall give the other party prompt written
notice upon learning of any breach or default by the other party under this
Agreement, and such notice shall include a description of the breach. The term
" _Cure Period_ " as used herein means a period commencing on the date Buyer
or Seller receives from the other written notice of breach or default
hereunder and continuing until the earlier of (i) thirty (30) calendar days
thereafter or (ii) five (5) business days after the day otherwise scheduled
for Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the breach or default is non-
monetary and cannot reasonably be cured within such period but can be cured
before the date five (5) business days after the scheduled Closing Date, and
if diligent efforts to cure promptly commence, then the Cure Period shall
continue as long as such diligent efforts to cure continue, but not beyond the
date five (5) business days after the scheduled Closing Date.

 



 

10.3. _Termination and Survival_. Neither party may terminate under Section
10.1(b), Section 10.1(c) or Section 10.1(h) if it or PBC Seller or PBC Buyer
(as applicable) is then in material breach or default under this Agreement or
the PBC APA, as the case may be. Subject to Section 10.4, Section 10.5,
Section 10.6 and Section 10.7 below, the termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any party of any liability for breach or default under this
Agreement that occurred prior to the date of termination. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, this Section 10.3 and Section 5.1
(Confidentiality), Section 10.5 (Liquidated Damages), Section 10.6 (Limitation
on Damages), Section 10.7 (Return of Escrow Deposit), Section 10.8 (Further
Limitation), Section 11.1 (Expenses), Section 11.6 (Entire Agreement), Section
11.9 (Governing Law), Section 11.10 (Neutral Construction), Section 11.12
(Counterparts; Delivery by Facsimile/Email) and Section 11.13 (Interpretation)
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

10.4. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the parties hereto would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
are otherwise breached and that any non-performance or breach of this
Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately compensated by monetary
damages alone and that the parties hereto would not have any adequate remedy
at law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which any
party hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity (including monetary
damages), such party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this
Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary
and permanent injunctive relief, subject to obtaining any required
Governmental Consents, to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of
the provisions of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement without posting any bond or other undertaking. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that the party
seeking specific performance shall be entitled to enforce specifically (a) a
partys obligations under Section 1.9; (b) Buyers obligation to draw upon and
cause the Financing to be funded, if available; and (c) a partys obligation
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
obligation to consummate the Closing and to pay the Purchase Price, if
applicable), if the conditions set forth in Article 6 or 7, as applicable,
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing) or waived. The parties hereto agree that they
will not contest the appropriateness of specific performance as a remedy.

 



 

10.5. _Liquidated Damages_. If Seller or PBC Seller terminates this Agreement
or the PBC APA pursuant to Section 10.1(c) hereof or thereof, in each case as
applicable, then the Escrow Deposit Fund shall be paid to Seller (or as
directed by Seller and PBC Seller) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, and such payment shall constitute liquidated damages. In
the event of such a termination, Seller and PBC Seller shall, in addition, be
entitled to prompt payment on demand from Buyer or PBC Buyer of the reasonable
attorneys fees and costs actually incurred by them in enforcing their rights
under this Agreement and the PBC APA. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
recovery of the Escrow Deposit Fund as set forth herein shall constitute
payment of liquidated damages and not a penalty and that such liquidated
damages amount is reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate
harm anticipated to be caused by Buyers or PBC Buyers material breach or
default under this Agreement or the PBC APA, the difficulty of proof of loss
and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an
adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to be consummated
hereunder. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Deposit Fund
covers liquidated damages under both this Agreement and the PBC APA.

 



 

10.6. _Limitation on Damages_. If Buyer or PBC Buyer terminates this Agreement
or the PBC APA pursuant to Section 10.1(b) hereof or thereof, then the
aggregate amount of losses and damages for which Seller and PBC Seller shall
be liable shall not exceed in the aggregate $33,500,000 (the " _Damages Cap_
"). The parties acknowledge and agree that the Damages Cap shall serve as a
cap on the aggregate amount of losses and damages for which Seller and PBC
Seller shall be liable as a result of a termination of this Agreement or the
PBC APA pursuant to Section 10.1(b) hereof or thereof and that this Section
10.6 shall work in concert with Section 10.6 of the PBC APA.

 



 

10.7. _Return of Escrow Deposit_. In all cases other than a termination of
this Agreement or the PBC APA pursuant to Section 10.1(c) hereof or thereof
which shall result in the payment of the Escrow Deposit Fund to Seller (or as
directed by Seller and PBC Seller) in accordance with Section 10.5 hereof, the
Escrow Deposit Fund shall be released to Buyer upon a termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



 

10.8. _Further Limitation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to
Sellers or any of their affiliates or any other person (other than Buyer and
its permitted assigns in respect of the Financing) relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract or
in tort or otherwise, and none of Sellers or any of their affiliates or any
other person (other than Buyer and its permitted assigns in respect of the
Financing) shall have any

 



      
 

 



 

rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources under this Agreement or
the Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort, or otherwise.

 



 

ARTICLE 11 _ 
MISCELLANEOUS_

 



 

11.1. _Expenses_. Except as may be otherwise specified herein, each party
shall be solely responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in
connection with the negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance
with the terms of this Agreement. All governmental fees and charges applicable
to any requests for Governmental Consents shall be paid one-half by Buyer and
one-half by Seller, except that if more than one HSR Act filing is necessary
because a party has more than one ultimate parent entity, then such party
shall pay the HSR Act filing fees for any additional filings. Buyer and Seller
shall each be responsible for one-half of all governmental recording, sales,
use and other similar transfer taxes, fees and charges (not including any
Taxes on or measured by income) applicable to the transfer of the Station
Assets under this Agreement. Each party is responsible for any commission,
brokerage fee, advisory fee or other similar payment that arises as a result
of any agreement or action of it or any party acting on its behalf in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

11.2. _Further Assurances_. After Closing, each party shall from time to time,
at the request of and without further cost or expense to the other, execute
and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and assumption and take such
other actions as may reasonably be requested in order to more effectively
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

11.3. _Assignment_. Neither party may assign this Agreement by operation of
law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other party hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may assign its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder to any affiliate of Buyer without the consent of Seller,
provided (i) that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations
hereunder and (ii) such affiliate shall be qualified under the Communications
Laws in accordance with Section 3.5 hereof. The terms of this Agreement shall
bind and inure to the benefit of the parties respective permitted successors
and assigns, and no assignment shall relieve any party of any obligation or
liability under this Agreement.

 



 

11.4. _Notices_. Any notice pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed delivered on the date of personal delivery or confirmed
facsimile transmission or confirmed delivery by a nationally recognized

11.5. _Amendments_. No amendment or waiver of compliance with any provision
hereof or consent pursuant to this Agreement shall be effective unless
evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom
enforcement of such amendment, waiver, or consent is sought. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Section 10.8, this Section 11.5,
Section 11.8 and Section 11.9(d) (and the related definitions of this
Agreement solely to the extent an amendment or modification thereof would
serve to modify the substance or provisions of such Sections in any material

written consent of the Financing Sources, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

or warranty with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement (or in any other agreement or
any of the Buyer Ancillary Agreements or Seller Ancillary Agreements executed
on the date hereof or thereof in connection herewith).

 



 

11.7. _Severability_. If any court or governmental authority holds any
provision in this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any
applicable law, then, so long as no party is deprived of the benefits of this
Agreement in any material respect, this Agreement shall be construed with the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision deleted and the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be
affected or impaired thereby.

 



 

11.8. _No Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement expressed or implied is
intended or shall be construed to give any rights to any person or entity
other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns
(provided that the Financing Sources shall be express third party
beneficiaries of the provisions of Section 10.8, Section 11.5, this Section
11.8 and Section 11.9(d) to the extent those provisions relate to the
Financing Sources or the Commitment Letters).

 



 

11.9. _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) The construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by
the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the choice of law
provisions thereof.

 



 

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined exclusively in the courts of the State of New York located in
the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, or of the United States of America
for the Southern District of New York, and the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and, in the
case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action
and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in
this Section 11.9 shall not constitute general consents to service of process
in the State of New York and shall have no effect for any purpose except as
provided in this Section 11.9 and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any
third party. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

 



 

(c) BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM

 



      
 

 



 

(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF BUYER OR SELLER IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that (i)
any claim, suit, action or other proceeding involving the Financing Sources
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the
performance of any services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York located in the borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, or if
such court does not have jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, New York County, (ii) it will not, and it will not permit any of its
affiliates to, bring or support any third party in bringing any claim, suit,
action or other proceeding in any court other than the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York located in the borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York, or if such court does not have
jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County and
(iii) it waives any right to trial by jury in respect of any such claim, suit,
action or other proceeding.

 



 

11.10. _Neutral Construction_. Buyer and Seller agree that this Agreement was
negotiated at arms-length and that the final terms hereof are the product of
the parties negotiations. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly
and equally drafted by Buyer and Seller, and the provisions hereof should not
be construed against a party on the grounds that the party drafted or was more
responsible for drafting the provision.

 



 

11.11. _Cooperation_. After Closing, each party shall cooperate with the other
in the investigation, defense or prosecution of any third party Action which
is pending or threatened against either party or its affiliates with respect
to the Stations or the Station Assets, whether or not any party has notified
the other of a claim for indemnity with respect to such matter. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall make available its
Transferred Employees to give depositions or testimony and shall furnish all
documentary or other evidence that Seller may reasonably request. Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket third party
expenses incurred in connection with the performance of Buyers obligations
under this Section 11.11.

 



 

11.12. _Counterparts; Delivery by Facsimile/Email_. This Agreement may be
executed in separate counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original
and all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement. This
Agreement, the agreements referred to herein, and each other agreement or
instrument entered into in connection herewith or therewith or contemplated
hereby or thereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed
and delivered by facsimile transmission or electronic mail in pdf form, shall
be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument
and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were
the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto
or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall
raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or email as a defense to
the formation or enforceability of a contract and each such party forever
waives any such defense.
