stockholders to enter into this Agreement providing for the merger  (the "
**Merger** ")  of  Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with
the General Corporation  Law of the State of Delaware (the " **DGCL** "), 
upon  the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  the  Special Committee has recommended that the Company Board
approve this Agreement  and declare its advisability and approve the Merger
in accordance with the  DGCL,  upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein;

 

 

**WHEREAS** ,  the  Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub, and the

**NOW,  THEREFORE** ,  in  consideration of the foregoing and the mutual

funds to which holders of  Shares  or Company Stock Options shall become
entitled pursuant to  Section 1.07(i) or Section 1.08(b), as applicable.
Promptly following  the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation  to, provide to and deposit in trust with the Paying
Agent, the aggregate  consideration to which stockholders of the Company and
holders of  Company  Stock Options become entitled under this Article I.
Until used for  that  purpose, the funds shall be invested by the Paying
Agent, as directed  by  Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations
of or guaranteed  by  the United States of America or obligations of an
agency of the United  States of America which are backed by the full faith
and credit of  the  United States of America, in commercial paper

or Standard and Poor's  Corporation, or in deposit accounts, certificates of
deposit or banker's  acceptances of, repurchase or reverse repurchase
agreements with,  or  Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial
banks, each of  which  has a combined capital surplus aggregating more than
$500 million  (based  on the most recent financial statements of the banks
which are then  publicly available at the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  **"** **SEC** ")  or otherwise), or in mutual funds investing solely
in one or more  of the  foregoing; _provided_   that no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Per Share  Merger Consideration payable to
former stockholders of the Company,  or the  Option Consideration payable to
former holders of Company Stock Options,  and Parent shall promptly provide,
or shall cause the Surviving  Corporation to promptly provide, additional
funds to the Paying Agent  for  the benefit of the former stockholders and
former option holders  of the  Company in the amount of any such losses to

Surviving Corporation shall  cause  to be mailed to each Person who was, at
the Effective Time, a holder  of  record of Shares entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration  pursuant to Section 1.07(i) a form of letter
of transmittal (which  shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and  title  to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the "
**Certificates** ")  shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the  Paying  Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the  Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal.
Upon surrender  to the  Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such
letter of transmittal,  duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions  thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to  such  instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to  receive  in exchange therefore the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each  Share  formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and
such Certificate shall  then be  canceled. No interest shall accrue or be

paid  on the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender  of
any  Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If 
the  payment equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made  to
a  Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate 
is  registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be  a 
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be  endorsed 
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the  Person 
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes 
required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration  to 
a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,  or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Merger Sub that  such  taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. If any holder  of Shares  is
unable to surrender such holder's Certificates because such  Certificates
have been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed, such  holder  may deliver in
lieu thereof an affidavit and indemnity bond in form  and  substance and
with surety reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving  Corporation.

the Paying  Agent  and not disbursed to holders of Shares (including,
without limitation,  all  interest and other income received by the Paying
Agent in respect  of all  funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such
holders shall  look  solely to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property,  escheat and other similar laws) only as general
creditors thereof  with  respect to any Per Share Merger Consideration that
may be payable  upon due  surrender of the Certificates held by them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  neither the Surviving Corporation, Parent nor
the Paying Agent shall  be  liable to any holder of a Share for any Per
Share Merger Consideration  delivered in respect of such Share to a public
official pursuant  to any  abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.
Any amounts remaining  unclaimed by holders of Shares two years after the
Effective Time  (or such  earlier date, immediately prior to such time when
the amounts would  otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority)  shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, the property  of  the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any
claims or interest  of any  Person previously entitled thereto.

prior to the  Effective  Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares except  as  otherwise provided herein or by applicable  Law.

for exchange  of  Certificates, and all Option Consideration paid in respect
of Company  Stock Options, in each case in accordance with the terms of
this  Article I  shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights  pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificates  and  the Company Stock Options, as applicable. If, after the
Effective  Time,  Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying  Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided  in  this Article I, except as otherwise provided by  Law.

amounts otherwise payable  hereunder to any Person such amounts as it is
required to deduct  and  withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision  of  Federal, state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts  are  so deducted and withheld, such deducted and

withholding was  made.

Shares shall have been  changed  into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason  of any  stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, reclassification,  redenomination, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange  of  shares or other similar transaction, the Per
Share Merger Consideration,  the Option Consideration and any other dependent
items shall be  appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company
Common  Stock  and the parties hereto the same economic effect as
contemplated by  this  Agreement prior to such action and as so adjusted
shall, from and  after  the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger
Consideration, the  Option  Consideration or other dependent item, subject
to further adjustment  in  accordance with this sentence.

Subsidiaries and with respect to which the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries has any material liability or obligation or which are 
maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any of  its 
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Plans").  For each Plan, the Company has

of the material terms thereof, (ii)  all  trust agreements, insurance or

description, (iv) the three  most  recent annual reports on Form 5500 filed

provision of, medical, surgical, hospitalization,  death or similar benefits
(whether or not insured) for employees  or former  employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for periods extending  beyond their retirement or
other termination of service, except as  may be  required by the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of  1985, as  amended, and
the regulations thereunder ("COBRA")  or other applicable Law, and at the

agreement that cannot be terminated  without the consent of the other party)
at any time without incurring  liability thereunder, other than in respect of
accrued and vested  obligations and medical or welfare claims incurred prior
to such  amendment  or termination. The Company has no plan, contract or
commitment,  whether  legally binding or not, to create any additional
employee benefit  or  compensation plans, policies or arrangements or,
except as may be  required  by Law, to modify any Plan.

obligations  required to be performed by them under, are not in any material
respect  in  default under or in violation of, and to the Company's
Knowledge, no other  party is in default or violation of, any Plan, and there
are no pending  or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened claims, lawsuits
or  arbitrations (other than routine claims for benefits), relating to  any

applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of COBRA  and the 
applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations thereunder  ("

employees or agents has, with respect to any Plan, engaged in or  been a 
party to any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the 
Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could result in the imposition  of 
either a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or  a tax

contract,  agreement, plan or other arrangement, whether or not a Plan, and 
no  employee, officer or director of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries 
will become entitled to any severance, termination pay or similar  payments 
or benefits in connection with the Transactions (either alone or  in 
combination with any other event), other than as specifically provided  for 
in this Agreement. No payment, accrual of additional benefits,  acceleration
of payments or vesting of any benefit under this Agreement,  any Plan or
similar agreement or arrangement between the Company  or any of  its
Affiliates and any "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined  in
Section 280G of the Code) could constitute an "excess parachute  payment" (as
such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code) in  connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either  alone or in combination
with any other event). No amounts payable  under  any Plan or otherwise will
fail to be deductible to the Company,  the  Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries for federal income tax  purposes by virtue of Section  162(m).

with  respect  to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates, with
such  exceptions as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  All 
liabilities or expenses of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect  of 
any Plan (including workers compensation) which have not been paid,  have 
been properly accrued on the Company's most recent financial statements in 
compliance with GAAP.

corporation duly organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the
requisite corporate power and corporate  authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business  as now being conducted, and is
duly qualified and in good standing to do  business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the  ownership or leasing of its
properties makes such qualification necessary other  than in such

contrary in this Section 5.04, before  the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board  or  Special Committee may furnish information

---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(i)

    |  

such  Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement (it 
being  understood that, subject to compliance with Section 5.04(a), such an 
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement by a Person  who

the  Company Board or Special Committee has determined in good faith after

reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal  (as  defined below);

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(iii)

    |  

prior  to taking such action such person shall have executed a
confidentiality  agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained  in the Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall
promptly  be  provided to Parent);

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(iv)

    |  

Parent  is provided, on a substantially concurrent basis, any non-public

         |  

(v)

    |  

the  Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising 
Parent that the Company Board or Special Committee, as applicable,  intends 
to take such action, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on  a 
current basis as to the status of and any material developments regarding 
any such inquiry or proposal

    
---|---|---

    |  

_Notice  of Superior Proposal_.  In addition to the obligations of the
Company set forth in  Sections 5.04(a) and (b), the Company shall promptly as
practicable  (and, in any event, within 24 hours) (i) advise Parent and
Merger  Sub, telephonically and in writing, of the Company's receipt of any 
Acquisition Proposal, any communication from any Person that would 
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any  request 
for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  or for 
access to the officers, employees, agents, business, properties,  assets, 
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any  Person 
that has made, or would reasonably be expected to make, an Acquisition 
Proposal and (ii) provide Parent and Merger Sub, in writing, with the  terms
and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, and a copy  of such 
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the identity of the  Person 
making the same. The Company shall inform Parent as promptly as  practicable
(and, in any event, within 24 hours) of any change to  the  material terms
of any such Acquisition Proposal. As promptly as  practicable (and, in any
event, within 24 hours) after determination  by  the Company Board or
Special Committee that an Acquisition Proposal  constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall deliver to Parent  and  Merger Sub, a written
notice (a " **Notice  of Superior Proposal** ")  advising them of such
determination, specifying the terms and conditions  of such Superior Proposal
and the identity of the Person making such  Superior Proposal, and providing
Parent and Merger Sub with a copy  of the  Superior Proposal.

_Change  in Recommendation_.  If the Company Board or Special Committee
determines, in its good  faith  judgment prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholders Approval  and  after consulting with outside legal counsel (who
may be the Company's  regularly engaged outside legal counsel or counsel to
the Special  Committee), that the failure to make a Change in the Company 
Recommendation (as defined below) or to terminate this Agreement  in 
accordance with Section  7.01(iv)(b)  would violate its fiduciary duties to
the Company's stockholders under  applicable Law, then the Company Board or
Special Committee may make  a  Change in the Company Recommendation and/or
terminate this Agreement  pursuant to Section  7.01(iv)(b).  " **Change 
in the Company Recommendation** "  means the Special Committee or Company
Board's (i) failure to make,  withdrawal of, or modification in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger  Sub  of the Company Recommendation, (ii)
failure to publicly confirm the  Company Recommendation within seven days
following Parent's written  request, (iii) recommendation or endorsement of a
Competing  Transaction or (iv) resolution or public announcement of an
intention  to do any of the foregoing. Neither the Company Board nor the
Special  Committee shall make a Change in the Company Recommendation or
terminate  this Agreement pursuant to Section  7.01(iv)(b)  unless (i) at
least three Business Days prior to taking such action  Parent shall have
received written notice from the Company (an  " **Adverse  Recommendation
Notice** ")  (A) advising Parent that the Company Board or Special Committee
has  received a Superior Proposal, (B) advising that the Company Board or 
Special Committee intends to make such Change in  the

         |  

Company  Recommendation or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 
7.01(iv)(b), as applicable, and (C) containing all information required  by 
Section 5.04(c), together with copies of any written offer or proposal  in 
respect of such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed  that any 
material amendment to the financial terms or other material terms  of such 
Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse Recommendation Notice  and a 
new three (3) Business Day period) and (ii) during such three Business  Day 
period the Company Board and Special Committee shall have negotiated  in 
good faith with Parent concerning any amendments proposed by Parent  to 
this Agreement and to the transactions contemplated hereby. Any disclosure 
that the Company Board may be compelled to make with respect to an 
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise in order to comply with its fiduciary 
duties under applicable Law or Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange  Act 
will not constitute a violation of this Agreement; provided,  that any such
disclosure that would constitute a Change in Company  Recommendation, and any
disclosure of a decision to terminate this  Agreement pursuant to Section
7.01(iv)(b), shall be made only in  compliance with this Section  5.04(d).

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

(e)

    |  

_Discussions  Prior to Agreement_.  The fact that the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their  Representatives have had discussions or
negotiations with Persons  prior to  the date of this Agreement regarding a
possible Acquisition Proposal  shall  not prevent the Company from taking
any of the actions permitted  by this  Section 5.04 with respect to a new
Acquisition Proposal submitted by  any such Person after the date of this
Agreement, that was not solicited  in violation of this  Section 5.04.

         |  

(i)

    |  

any  merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, 
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction 
(including any so-called merger-of-equals and whether or not the  Company 
is the entity surviving any such transaction) involving the Company  or any 
of its Subsidiaries which results in any person beneficially owning  20% or 
more of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or  of any 
of its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of the assets of the Company and  its 
Subsidiaries (directly or indirectly, including by the ownership  of equity 
or voting securities);

         |  

(ii)

         |  

(iii)

    |

securities in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries participates  and

of equity or voting securities of the Company or of any of  its 
Subsidiaries; or

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(iv)

    |  

any  transaction or series of transactions, including a tender offer or

A  " **Superior  Proposal** "  means a bona fide, unsolicited written offer
(in its most recently  amended  or modified terms, if amended or modified)
made by a Person to enter  into  a Competing Transaction, the effect of
which would be that the  stockholders of the Company would beneficially own
less than 50%  of the  capital stock of the combined or ongoing entity, or
the entity that  succeeds to the assets of the Company, as applicable, and
which the  Company Board or Special Committee determines, in its good faith 
judgment  (after consulting with its financial advisor and/or legal counsel 
and  taking into account any amendments proposed by Parent to this
Agreement  or  to the transactions contemplated hereby) and taking into
account  all  relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
offer  that  it deems relevant in such circumstances under the DGCL, to be
more  favorable to Company stockholders from a financial point of view  than
the  Merger and which is reasonably likely to be  consummated.

(a)

    |  

_Indemnification_.  Without limiting any additional rights that any employee,
officer  or  director may have under any employment agreement or benefit
Plan  or under  the Company's certificate of incorporation or by laws, for a
period of six  (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause  the  Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each
present  (as of  immediately prior to the Effective Time) and former officer
or director  of  the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries (the "
**Indemnified  Directors and Officers** "),  against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries,  fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including, attorneys' fees  and disbursements (collectively, "
**Costs** "),  incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or  investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative,  arising out of actions taken by them in their capacity as
officers  or  directors at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement  and  the transactions and actions

contemplated  hereby), or taken by them at the request of the Company or any
Company  Subsidiary, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the 
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that applicable Law permits  a 
Delaware corporation to indemnify its officers and directors. Each 
Indemnified Director and Officer will be entitled to advancement  of 
expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding  or 
investigation from the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business  Days 
of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Director  or 
Officer of a request therefor and reasonable documentation thereof; 
provided  that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking  to  repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such person  is not  entitled to indemnification. The Surviving Corporation
shall not  settle,  compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in
any proceeding  or  threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
claim (and  in which  indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified
Director or Officer  hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes  an  unconditional release of such Indemnified Director or
Officer from  all  liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding,
investigation  or  claim or such Indemnified Director or Officer otherwise 
consents.

    
---|---

Corporation  shall continue to contain provisions no less favorable with
respect  to  indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
former  or  present directors and officers than are presently set forth in
the  Company's certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which provisions
shall  not, except to the extent required to comply with applicable Law, 
be  amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years 
from  the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the 
rights  thereunder of any such individuals. 

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

        

(c)

    |  

_D andO  Insurance_.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall endeavor
to (and if  it  unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
after  the  Effective Time) obtain, and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain  for a  period of six (6) years following the Effective Time,
directors' and  officers' liability insurance coverage with respect to
matters existing or  occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, from an
insurance carrier  with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance  carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance,  having terms and conditions and providing coverage in an amount
at  least  as favorable to the insured parties as the terms and conditions
and  amounts of coverage of the Company's existing policies; _provided_ , 
that Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not be required by this Section 
5.06(c) to incur costs in excess of 300% of the annual premiums paid  by 
the Company under its directors' and officers' liability policies as in 
effect as of the date hereof.

_Existing  Agreements_.  Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor  and  perform under all indemnification agreements

---|--- 
    

 

 

        

(e)

    |  

_Survivability_.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
claim for  indemnification pursuant to Section 5.06(a) is made by any
Indemnified  Director or Officer by written notice to the Company on or
prior  to the  sixth anniversary of the Effective Time (such notice to set
forth  in  reasonable detail the facts relevant to such claim) the
provisions  of this  Section 5.06(a) shall continue in effect with respect
to such claim  until  the final disposition of such claim.

enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Directors and Officers and  their

herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which  an 
Indemnified Director or Officer is entitled, whether pursuant to  Law, 
contract or otherwise.

_Successors  and Assigns_.  In the event that the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other  Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or  entity  of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all  or  substantially all of its properties and assets as an
entirety in  one or a  series of related transactions to any Person(s),
then, and in each  such  case, proper provision shall be made so that such
continuing or surviving  corporation or entity or such Persons(s), as the
case may be, shall  assume  the obligations set forth in this Section 5.06;
provided that the  Surviving Corporation shall not be relieved from such
obligation.  In  addition, the Surviving Corporation shall not distribute,
sell, transfer  or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that
would  reasonably be expected to render the Surviving Corporation unable 
to  satisfy its obligations under this Section 5.06. Parent hereby 
unconditionally guarantees the obligations of the Surviving Corporation 
under this Section 5.06.

**SECTION  8.04.**

    |  

**Severability.**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

If  any  term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable  of  being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all
other conditions and  provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect  so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected  in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that  any  term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced,  the  parties hereto shall modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent  of the parties as closely
as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order  that the Transactions
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest  extent possible.

 

 

        

**SECTION  8.05.**

    |  

**Entire  Agreement; Assignment.**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

This  Agreement, including all exhibits, annexes and schedules hereto,
together with  the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement
among the parties  with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede
all prior agreements  and  undertakings, both written and oral, among the
parties, or any of them, with  respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

 

        

**SECTION  8.06.**

    |  

**Parties  in Interest.**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

This  Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party  hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or  shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature  whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than as
provided in  Section  7.03(b)(iv)  and Section  7.03(c)(iii)  and, 
following the Effective Time, Section 5.06 (which is intended to be for the 
benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such  Persons).

 

 

        

**SECTION  8.07.**

    |  

**Specific  Performance.**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

The  parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
any  provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms  hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance
of the  terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

---|--- 
    

 

 

This  Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws  of  the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to
be performed  in  that State, without giving effect to any other choice of
law or conflict of  law  provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
or otherwise). The parties  hereto hereby:

 

 

         |  

(i)

    |  

submit  to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such state or federal court 
sitting  in the State of Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising out 
of or  relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto;  and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(ii)

    |  

irrevocably  waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise,  in  any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally
to the  jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt 
or  immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in  an 
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or  that this 
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of  the 
above-named courts.

---|--- 
    

 

 

This  Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile

to be an original  but  all of which taken together shall constitute one and

**Company  Disclosure Schedule.**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

The  inclusion of any item in any Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall  also apply to other sections and subsections to the extent that it is
reasonably  apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
would also apply  to  or qualify such other sections and subsections;
however, such  inclusion:

 

 

        

(a)

    |  

does  not represent a determination by the Company that such item is
"material"; 

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60

arise  in the ordinary course of business.

**Interpretation**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

The  words  "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of like import used
in this  Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular  provision of this Agreement. The captions herein are included for
convenience  of  reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or
interpretation  hereof. References to Articles and Sections are, unless
otherwise indicated,  references to Articles and Sections of this Agreement.
Any singular term in  this  Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural,
and any plural term the  singular. Whenever the words "include", "includes"
or "including" are used  in  this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without  limitation", whether or not they are in fact
followed by those words or words  of  like import. References to any statute
are to that statute as amended from  time  to time, and to the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and, in each  case, to any successor
statute, rules or regulations thereto.
