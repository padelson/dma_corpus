thereof, if and when payable in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, with respect to each share represented by such certificate as

payable in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, with
respect thereto, which is properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(d) If any consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition to such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange
shall pay to the Surviving Corporation any Transfer Taxes or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of such consideration to a Person other than
that of the registered holder of the certificate so surrendered, or such
Person shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(e) If any certificate for shares of Company Stock or Class A Preferred Stock
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, and upon the receipt by the Surviving Corporation of an agreement
from such Person to provide reasonably satisfactory indemnification to the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such certificate, the Surviving

(vi) deposit an amount equal to the Representative Reserve Amount into an
account established by the Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Representative shall provide to Purchaser, not less than two Business Days
prior to the Closing, applicable wire transfer or other payment instructions;
and

 



 

(vii) deposit an amount equal to the Escrow Fund minus the Deposit Amount into

(c) Promptly following the Closing, the Company and Purchaser shall give joint
written instructions to the Deposit Agent to deliver the Deposit Amount held

(d) The Company shall request each Stockholder, each holder of In-the-Money
Options and/or In-the-Money Warrants and each recipient of a portion of the
Company Bonus Payment to submit to the Company, not later than the time the
date of the Closing is determined pursuant to Section 2.2, instructions for
delivery of the payment to be made pursuant to Sections 2.10(b)(i),
2.10(b)(ii) and 2.10(b)(iii), as applicable to such Person. No later than such

Purchaser in respect of its outstanding term loan under its credit agreement
during such Supplemental Period _minus_ (ii) any investment earnings earned by
the Escrow Fund during such Supplemental Period (each such amount, a "
_Supplemental Deposit_ "). Upon receipt thereof by the Escrow Agent, each
Supplemental Deposit shall automatically become part of the Escrow Fund and
shall supplement the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Tax Escrow Amount in
proportion to their relative amounts of the Escrow Fund as of the last day of
the applicable Supplemental Period.

 



 

Section 2.11 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but in no event more than 60
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall in good faith prepare and deliver
to the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders) a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") indicating PurchaserÂ’s calculation of the Merger
Consideration and each of the components thereof, in each case in a manner
consistent with the Agreed Accounting Principles, as applicable, together with
reasonable supporting detail; _provided_ , _however_ , that the valuation of
"Inventories" included in the calculation of Net Working Capital and
incorporated into the Closing Statement shall be based on the physical
inventory to be taken by the Company and Purchaser on a date not earlier than
15 Business Days prior to the Closing Date as agreed to by Purchaser and the
Company (at which representatives of Purchaser, the Company, the
Representative and KPMG LLP are to be present), as updated by the CompanyÂ’s
inventory records for the period after the taking of such physical inventory
through the Closing Date. Subject to the RepresentativeÂ’s entry into a
customary confidentiality and access agreement with PurchaserÂ’s independent
outside auditors and upon such auditorsÂ’ consent, at the time of delivery of
the Closing Statement, Purchaser shall also deliver to the Representative all
schedules and workpapers used by it in preparing the Closing Statement and all
line items set forth therein.

 



 

(b) After receipt of the Closing Statement, the Representative shall have 60
days to review the Closing Statement, together with the work papers used in
the preparation thereof. Purchaser shall (i) provide the Representative and
its representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to all
relevant work papers, trial balances and other financial information of the
Surviving Corporation to the extent necessary or useful to complete the review
of the Closing Statement, and (ii) cooperate with the RepresentativeÂ’s and its
representativesÂ’ reasonable requests with respect to the review of the Closing
Statement, including by providing on a timely basis all information necessary
or useful in reviewing the Closing Statement. Unless the Representative
delivers written notice to Purchaser on or prior to the 60th day after the

 



      
 

 



 

RepresentativeÂ’s receipt of the Closing Statement specifying in reasonable
detail the amount, nature and basis of all disputed items, the Representative
shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the calculation of the Merger
Consideration set forth on the Closing Statement. If the Representative
notifies Purchaser of its objection to the calculation of the Merger
Consideration as set forth on the Closing Statement (which notification shall
be in writing and shall set forth in reasonable detail the RepresentativeÂ’s
reasons for such objection, including the RepresentativeÂ’s calculation of the
Merger Consideration and each of the components thereof, in each case in a
manner consistent with the Agreed Accounting Principles, as applicable), the
Representative and Purchaser shall, within 15 days (or such longer period as
the parties may agree in writing) following such notice (the " _Resolution
Period_ "), attempt to resolve their differences and any resolution by them as
to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive (other than as
a result of manifest error or fraud).

 



 

(c) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, there are any amounts of
the Merger Consideration remaining in dispute, then such amounts remaining in
dispute shall be submitted to KPMG LLP or, if mutually agreed in good faith by
Purchaser and the Representative, another accounting firm of national standing
(the " _Neutral Auditors_ "). The Neutral Auditors shall act as an arbitrator
to determine, based solely on the provisions of this Section 2.11, the
applicable defined terms set forth herein related to the calculation of the
Merger Consideration and the presentations by the Representative and
Purchaser, and not by independent review, only those issues still in dispute.
The Neutral AuditorsÂ’ determination shall be made within 30 days of the
dispute being submitted for their determination, shall be set forth in a
written statement delivered to the Representative and Purchaser and shall be
final, non-appealable and binding on the parties hereto, absent manifest error
or fraud. A judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction may be entered upon
the Neutral AuditorsÂ’ determination. The Neutral Auditors shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over, and resort to the Neutral Auditors as provided in this
Section 2.11(c) shall be the only recourse and remedy of the parties against
one another with respect to, any disputes arising out of or relating to the
adjustments to the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.11. The
fees, costs and expenses of the Neutral Auditors shall be paid 50% by
Purchaser, on the one hand, and 50% by the Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders), on the other hand. The term " _Final Closing Statement_ "
shall mean the definitive Closing Statement agreed to (or deemed to be agreed
to) by Purchaser and the Representative in accordance with Section 2.11(b) or
resulting from the determinations made by the Neutral Auditors in accordance
with this Section 2.11(c) (in addition to those items theretofore agreed to by
the Representative and Purchaser).

 



 

(d) If the Final Closing Amount exceeds the Estimated Merger Consideration,
then:

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall, promptly following final determination of the Final
Closing Amount, deposit sufficient funds with and cause the Paying Agent to
pay to the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders and for prompt
further distribution thereto in accordance with their Percentage Interests) an
amount equal to (A) the Final Closing Amount minus (B) the Estimated Merger
Consideration; and

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) Purchaser and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to
the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders and for prompt further
distribution thereto in accordance with their Percentage Interests) the
Adjustment Escrow Amount.

 



 

(e) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Closing Amount,
then:

 



 

(i) Purchaser and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to
Purchaser from the Adjustment Escrow Amount an amount equal to the lesser of
(A) the difference between the Estimated Merger Consideration and the Final
Closing Amount, and (B) the Adjustment Escrow Amount; and

 



 

(ii) Purchaser and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to release
from the Escrow Account to the Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders and for prompt further distribution thereto in accordance with
their Percentage Interests) the remaining balance of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount.

 



 

(f) If the Estimated Merger Consideration equals the Final Closing Amount,
then Purchaser and the Representative shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to
the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders and for prompt further
distribution thereto in accordance with their Percentage Interests) the
Adjustment Escrow Amount.

 



 

(g) All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be made (and, with
respect to payments to be made by the Escrow Agent, Purchaser and the
Representative shall take all commercially reasonable action to cause the
Escrow Agent to make the required payments) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within two Business Days following the determination of the
Final Closing Statement to accounts previously designated in writing by
Purchaser and the Representative.

 



 

(h) The Adjustment Escrow Amount exists solely to secure the obligations of
the Securityholders pursuant to this Section 2.11 and shall not be subject to
any other provision of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, PurchaserÂ’s
sole recourse with respect to the obligations of the Securityholders pursuant
to this Section 2.11 shall be recovery from the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
except in the case of fraud by or on behalf of the Company, in which case
Purchaser may be entitled to recover additional amounts pursuant to Section
10.2(a)(viii) or Section 10.3, as applicable.

 



 

Section 2.12 _Appraisal Rights_. Holders of shares of Company Stock or Class
A Preferred Stock which have complied with all requirements for demanding and
perfecting appraisal rights as set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Holders_ ," and the shares held thereby with respect to which
appraisal rights have been exercised, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") are
entitled to their rights under such Laws. Each Dissenting Share shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the (i) the Adjusted Per
Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Sections 2.9 and 2.10 and any
Per Share Escrow Proceeds in respect thereof, if and when payable in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or (ii) the Per Share
Class A Consideration, as applicable. Dissenting Holders shall

 



      
 

 



 

be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting
Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL. Each share of Company Stock or Class A Preferred Stock held by holders
who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or
lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive (i) the
Adjusted Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Sections 2.9 and
2.10 and any Per Share Escrow Proceeds in respect thereof, if and when payable
in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or (ii) the Per
Share Class A Consideration, as applicable, in each case without any interest
thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.9, of the
certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares. The Company
shall give Purchaser prompt written notice of any assertions of appraisal
rights or withdrawals of assertions of appraisal rights, and any other
instrument in respect thereof received by the Company and the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Purchaser or as required by applicable Law, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demand.

 



 

Section 2.13 _Aggregate Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the aggregate consideration payable to
Securityholders and holders of Stock Options in respect of their Company
Stock, Stock Options and/or Warrants pursuant to the Merger (for the avoidance
of doubt, not including any indemnification payments required to be made by
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement) shall not exceed the aggregate amount
of, without duplication, the (a) Merger Consideration, (b) Escrow Fund (and
any other supplemental amounts deposited with the Escrow Agent in accordance
with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement) and (c) Representative Reserve
Amount (collectively, the " _Aggregate Consideration_ "). In the event that
the Aggregate Consideration is inadequate to pay in full all amounts to be
paid to the Securityholders and holders of Stock Options pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, the Company Certificate of Incorporation, Stock Options
and/or Warrants, the Aggregate Consideration shall be divided among the
Securityholders and holders of Stock Options in accordance with the relative
rights and preferences set forth in the Company Certificate of Incorporation,
Stock Options and/or Warrants as in effect as of the Effective Time, and
neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for
any excess amounts. For the avoidance of doubt, if, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of issued and outstanding shares
of Company Stock, Stock Options or Warrants shall have been changed into, or
exchanged for, a different number of securities or a difference class of
securities, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination
or exchange of securities, the Adjusted Per Share Merger Consideration, Per
Share Escrow Proceeds, if and when payable, Option Payment and Warrant Payment
shall be correspondingly adjusted to provide the Securityholders and holders
of Stock Options the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Aggregate Consideration to be paid by Purchaser to the Securityholders and
holders of Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement be increased by any such
adjustment.

 



 

Section 2.14 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to

 



      
 

 



 

deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise deliverable under this
Agreement, and from any other payments otherwise required pursuant to this
Agreement, to any Securityholder, holder of Stock Options, holder of Class A
Preferred Stock or recipient of Company Bonus Payments such amounts as
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code
or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such
Securityholder, holder of Stock Options, holder of Class A Preferred Stock or

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly formed, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation
or organization, and has the requisite corporate or other power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on the Surviving
Business as it is now being conducted. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries
is in violation of any provision of its respective certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (or if such Subsidiary is not a corporation, its
organizational documents) (collectively, the " _Company Organizational
Documents_ ").

 



 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in good standing and duly
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the transaction of the
Surviving Business makes such qualification necessary. True and complete
copies of the CompanyÂ’s and each of its SubsidiaryÂ’s Company Organizational
Documents, each as amended to date and currently in full force and effect,
have been made available to Purchaser. _Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ sets forth a list of each of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries, indicating
the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation or each such Subsidiary, and
all jurisdictions in which the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are
qualified to do business.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The CompanyÂ’s authorized and outstanding capital stock is set forth in
_Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_. All outstanding shares
of Company Stock, all shares of Class A Preferred Stock and the shares of
capital stock or equity or ownership interests of each Subsidiary of the
Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
are not subject to preemptive or similar rights. _Section 3.2(a) of the
Company_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Disclosure Schedule_ also sets forth a list, as of the date hereof, of the
Stockholders and the number of shares of Company Stock and Class A Preferred
Stock held by each such Stockholder. Except as set forth in _Section 3.2(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, there are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, conversion rights, rights of first offer, rights of
first refusal, tag-along rights, drag-along rights, registration rights,
commitments, arrangements or any other agreements to which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company is bound which obligate the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company to (i) issue, grant, deliver or sell or cause to be issued, granted,
delivered or sold any additional shares of Company Stock or any other capital
stock or equity or ownership interests of the Company or any Subsidiary of the

Company Stock or any other capital stock or equity or ownership interests of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) purchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of Company Stock or any other capital stock or
equity or ownership interests of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company,

Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth, (i) with respect to each Stock Option, a list
of the holder thereof, the number of shares of common stock of U.S.
Corrugated, Inc. subject thereto, the exercise price, the grant date and the

Subsidiaries committed to grant to any Employee or Disposed Assets Employee,
including the name of the Person to whom such commitment was made, the "Option
Exercise Price per Share set on the most recent Grant Date" (as such phrase is
used in the Supplemental Bonus Plan), and the number of shares of stock of
U.S. Corrugated, Inc. covered by such commitment (and the class of stock
subject thereto). Upon the execution of an Option Cancellation Agreement by
the holder of each outstanding Stock Option, the treatment described in
Article II with respect to each such Stock Option will be permitted under the
terms of the Stock Option Plan and the applicable award agreement granting
such Stock Options. _Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ also
sets forth, with respect to each Warrant, a list of the holder thereof, the
number of shares of Company Stock subject thereto, the exercise price, the
issuance date and the expiration date. Since the issuance date of each such
Warrant, there has been no occurrence which would trigger any anti-dilutive
provisions of the agreement pertaining to each such Warrant (including any
provision contained in Section 4 thereof). There are no stock purchase rights
outstanding under the Stock Option Plan.

 



 

(b) All Stock Options have been granted with exercise prices that equaled or
exceeded the fair market value of the shares underlying such Stock Options on
the applicable date of grant. Except for the Stockholders Agreement or as set
forth in _Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, to the
knowledge of the Company, there are no voting trusts, stockholder agreements,

in any Person. _Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth
the authorized and outstanding capital stock or equity or ownership interests
of each of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in _Section 3.2(c)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, the Company, either directly or
indirectly, owns 100% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock or equity or ownership interests of each of its Subsidiaries. Except as
set forth in _Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, all such
interests are held free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens,
each of which will be removed prior to the Closing. Except as set forth in
_Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, no Subsidiary of the
Company owns any shares of the Company Stock.

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms
hereof. The Company has duly authorized the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due execution and authorization by
the other parties hereto, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

it of the Merger, other than the notices to be delivered by the Company to
Stockholders who did not execute written consents adopting and approving the
Merger in accordance with Section 5.2.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. Neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby will require on the part of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries any consent, waiver, order, declaration, approval,

Governmental Entity, except (a) for any applicable filings required under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR

or (c) as provided for in Section 2.3.

Subsidiaries or any of their assets, rights or properties are bound, except
for such violations, breaches and defaults (or rights of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) as to which requisite waivers or consents have
been obtained or which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, or (c) assuming the consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits and filings or notifications referred to in Section
3.4 and this Section 3.5 are duly and timely obtained or made, violate any Law
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets, rights and properties, except for such conflicts,
violations, breaches or defaults which would not reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries in any material respect or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Financial Statements; Books and Records_.

 



 

(a) Attached hereto as _Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ are
true and complete copies of (a) the unaudited consolidated balance sheets and

the Disposed Subsidiaries) as of and for the fiscal year ended January 1,
2011, (b) the audited consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations

subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments (which adjustments are
not reasonably expected to be material either individually or in the
aggregate) and lack footnotes.

 



 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain accurate books and records
reflecting their assets and liabilities and maintain internal accounting
controls that provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are executed
with managementÂ’s authorization, (ii) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of their financial statements and to maintain
accountability for their assets, (iii) that access to their assets is
permitted only in accordance with managementÂ’s authorization, (iv) that the
reporting of their assets is compared with existing assets at regular
intervals and (v) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the CompanyÂ’s or its SubsidiariesÂ’ assets,
except as would not (with respect to the foregoing clauses (i) through (v)),
individually or in the aggregate, materially affect the Latest Financial
Statements or the audited consolidated balance sheets and statements of
operations for the Company and its Subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years
ended each of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (disregarding for this purpose

Disposed Subsidiaries).

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any representative thereof, has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods or internal accounting controls of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in improper accounting or auditing practices (disregarding for this

Assets, the Disposed Liabilities or the Disposed Subsidiaries).

the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices since the date
of the Latest Balance Sheet, (iii) liabilities arising under this Agreement or
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or (iv) liabilities
that are otherwise disclosed in _Section 3.7(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_.

 



 

(b) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.7(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, since the date of the Latest Balance Sheet neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any long term liability other than in the
ordinary course of business.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Compliance with Law_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, the Company and each of the Retained Subsidiaries is and has been
for the past five years in compliance in all material respects with all Laws
which apply to such entity. Except as set forth in _Section 3.8 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notification alleging the contrary to the foregoing.
This Section 3.8 does not relate to matters with respect to Environmental
Matters, which are the subject of Section 3.16.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on _Section 3.8(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries have all material Permits
that are required for the conduct of the Surviving Business as currently
conducted or currently contemplated to be conducted, including the ownership,
leasing, operation or use of any of the assets of the Company and the Retained
Subsidiaries. All such Permits have been validly issued or assigned and duly
obtained, and are presently held, by the Company or the Retained Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, and are in full force and effect and are listed and
briefly described in _Section 3.8(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_.
The operation of the Surviving Business is in compliance with such Permits and
the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries have filed all necessary reports and
maintained and retained all necessary records pertaining to such Permits,
other than where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries in any material
respect. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of the Retained

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries to terminate the rights thereof under any of such Permits and the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall not conflict with, result in the

Employee or, to the knowledge of the Company, Stockholder or holder of
Warrants or Stock Options; in each case that relate to or affect the Company
or any of the Retained Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or
properties or the operation of the Surviving Business or consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Neither the Company nor any of the Retained
Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding and unsatisfied order, writ,

complete list of each Plan and each Employment Agreement. _Section 3.10(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_ identifies (i) each Plan that is a Company
Multiemployer Plan, and (ii) each Plan and Employment Agreement that is
maintained or sponsored by any Disposed Subsidiary or to which any Disposed
Subsidiary is a party and each Multiemployer Plan with respect to which any
Disposed Subsidiary contributes or otherwise has any liability. None of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Disposed Subsidiary maintains,
operates or has liability with respect to any employee benefit plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement that is or was subject to the Laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_: (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have performed all obligations
required to be performed by such entity under each Plan and Employment
Agreement, including obligations related to making contributions or paying
premiums, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in default
under or in violation of any Plan or Employment Agreement, or any contractual
agreement related thereto; (ii) each Plan (with respect to any Company
Multiemployer Plan, to the knowledge of the Company) and Employment Agreement
has been established, operated, maintained and performed in compliance with
its terms, ERISA, the Code and all other

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Laws, statutes, orders, rules and regulations, and each Plan which
is intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code
is so qualified and has received a favorable determination letter as to its
qualification and nothing has occurred whether by action or failure to act
that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification;
(iii) no "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA and no breach of fiduciary duties, has occurred
with respect to any Plan (with respect to any Company Multiemployer Plan, to
the knowledge of the Company); (iv) there are no actions, proceedings,
arbitrations, investigations, suits or claims pending, or to the knowledge of
the Company threatened or anticipated (other than routine, non-material claims
for benefits) with respect to any Plan (with respect to any Company
Multiemployer Plan, to the knowledge of the Company) or Employment Agreement;
(v) no Plan (with respect to any Company Multiemployer Plan, to the knowledge
of the Company) is under audit or investigation by the IRS, the Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, or any other Governmental
Entity, and to the knowledge of the Company, no such audit or investigation is
pending or threatened, and (vi) the Company or one of its Subsidiaries may
amend or terminate each Plan at any time without incurring liability therefor,
except for claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 3.10(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, at no time in the past six years has the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any Disposed Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates contributed to or been required to contribute to, directly or
indirectly, or incurred any withdrawal liability (within the meaning of
Section 4201 of ERISA) or any other liability with respect to, any (i)
Multiemployer Plan, (ii) any other plan covered by Title IV of ERISA, (iii)
any multiple employer plan subject to Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section
413(c) of the Code, or (iv) any multiple employer welfare benefit arrangement
(as defined in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA).

 



 

(e) With respect to each Company Multiemployer Plan, the Company has, prior to
the date hereof, requested and received the most recent estimate of withdrawal
liability available, and _Section 3.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_
identifies such estimates of withdrawal liability. All material
communications during the preceding five years between the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any Disposed Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates and any Multiemployer Plan, including the information provided by
the Company Multiemployer Plans in connection with the estimates set forth on
_Section 3.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, have been delivered to
Purchaser. If the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any Disposed Subsidiary
or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates were to withdraw from each Company
Multiemployer Plan as of the Closing Date, the liability that would actually
be incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Disposed Subsidiaries
with respect to any Company Multiemployer Plan would not be greater than the
applicable estimated withdrawal liability disclosed on _Section 3.10(e) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_. Neither the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any Disposed Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has incurred any liability on account of a "complete withdrawal" or
a "partial withdrawal" (within the meaning of Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA,
respectively) from any Multiemployer Plan, no circumstances exist that would
give rise to a complete or partial withdrawal from such plan by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries, any Disposed Subsidiary or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any
Disposed Subsidiary or any of

 



      
 

 



 

their respective ERISA Affiliates has received notice that a Multiemployer
Plan is assessing a withdrawal liability that could result in any liability to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any Disposed Subsidiary nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, whether such liability is contingent or
otherwise. All contributions and premium payments owed by the Company, its
Subsidiaries, the Disposed Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates
with respect to Multiemployer Plans have been paid when due. None of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any Disposed Subsidiary, nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has experienced a reduction in contribution base
units in the three (3) consecutive years prior to the date of this Agreement
that would, if continued, reasonably be expected to result in a partial
withdrawal assessment that could result in any liability to them, whether such
liability is contingent or otherwise. _Section 3.10(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_ identifies each Multiemployer Plan that has notified the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any Disposed Subsidiary or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates of any failure to satisfy minimum funding
standards, or of its status as a critical or endangered plan. The Disposition
will not result in any withdrawal liability being incurred with respect to any
Company Multiemployer Plan or increase the likelihood of a "partial
withdrawal" occurring with respect to any Company Multiemployer Plan.

 



 

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 3.10(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, no Plan provides, and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
nor any Disposed Subsidiary has any liability or obligation to provide, life
insurance, medical or other employee welfare benefits to any Employee upon or
following such EmployeeÂ’s retirement or termination of employment or, in the
case of a Disposed Assets Employee, following the Disposition, except as may
be required by Section 4980B of the Code. No Company or Company Plan has any
obligation to provide welfare benefits to any Person who is not a current or
former employee of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Disposed
Subsidiary or a beneficiary thereof. None of the Company, any Subsidiary, any
Disposed Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has any
liability of any kind whatsoever on account of any violation of the health
care requirements of Part 6 or 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section
4980B or 4980D of the Code.

 



 

(g) Each Plan which is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been administered, operated and
maintained in all respects according to the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code, and none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any Disposed
Subsidiary has been required to withhold or pay any Taxes as a result of a
failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code. None of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries nor any Disposed Subsidiary has any obligation to make a
"gross-up" or similar payment in respect of any Taxes that may become payable
under Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(h) Except pursuant to the Stock Option Plan or the Supplemental Bonus Plan or
as set forth in _Section 3.10(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, the
execution of, and performance of the transactions contemplated in, this
Agreement (including the Disposition) will not, whether alone or in connection
with any other event, result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or compensation or obligation to fund benefits with
respect to any Employee or Disposed Assets Employee under any Plan or
Employment Agreement or otherwise.

 



       
 

 



 

(i) Except as set forth with specificity (indicating the affected person and
the amount at issue) in _Section 3.10(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have not made any payments or provided any
benefits, and are not obligated to make any payments or provide any benefits,
and are not a party to any arrangement that under any circumstances could
obligate any of them to make any payments or provide any benefits, that would
not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to make a "gross-up" or similar payment
in respect of any Taxes that may become payable under Section 4999 of the Code

 



 

(j) _Section 1.1(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a list
of each participant and such participantÂ’s entitlement under the Supplemental
Bonus Plan (assuming for these purposes that the Merger constitutes a "Change
of Control," as such term is used in the Supplemental Bonus Plan).

Disclosure Schedule_, (a) each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has

all contingent liabilities) as such value is established and liabilities
evaluated in accordance with GAAP, (b) will own assets the present fair
saleable value of which is not less than the amount that will be required to
pay the probable liability on their debts as they become absolute and matured,
(c) will be able to pay their debts and other liabilities as they mature in

the Closing:

 



 

(a) except as explicitly contemplated by this Agreement or the Disposition
Agreements, the Related Party Contracts set forth on _Section 5.4 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include
the Stockholders Agreement and the Securities Purchase Agreement) shall have
been terminated (pursuant to an omnibus termination agreement or other
documentation reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Purchaser) in a
manner agreed to by the Company and Purchaser, and shall be of no further or
continued force or effect; and

 



      
 

 



 

(b) all intercompany balances (other than trade payables and trade receivables

as explicitly contemplated by this Agreement or the Disposition Agreements)
between or among the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, a Disposition
Purchaser, any Securityholder or any of their respective Affiliates shall be
settled, paid or otherwise terminated in a manner agreed to by the Company and
Purchaser.

 



 

The Company shall, from time to time at the request of Purchaser, which
request(s) shall be made by written notice to the Company not later than five
(5) Business Days before Closing, add Related Party Contracts to, or delete
Related Party Contracts from, _Section 5.4 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ (making appropriate corresponding changes to _Section 6.1(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ where applicable), which added or deleted Related
Party Contracts shall be deemed to have been included on, or excluded from,
_Section 5.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ or _Section 6.1(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_, as the case may be, as of the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Company 401(k) Plan_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all action necessary to
transfer sponsorship of the Company 401(k) Plan to a Disposed Subsidiary or a
Disposition Purchaser. The Company shall allow Purchaser to review and comment
upon the resolutions effectuating such transfer of sponsorship prior to their
adoption and such comments shall be taken into consideration in good faith by
the Company. On and after the Closing Date, none of Purchaser, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any
liability in connection with or otherwise related to the Company 401(k) Plan.

 



 

(b) To the extent not already permitted, the Company shall cause the plan
sponsor of the Company 401(k) Plan to amend such plan no later than the

related to outstanding loans to plans maintained by Purchaser or its
Affiliates.

 



 

(c) To the extent the foregoing actions described in this Section 5.5 cannot
be effectuated without the consent of one or more collective bargaining units,
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such
collective bargaining units and shall not take any such actions if such
consent is not obtained. To the extent the Company enters into discussions
with such collective bargaining units regarding the Company 401(k) Plan, the
Company will use reasonable best efforts to allow Purchaser to participate in
all such discussions and the resolutions of any such discussion shall be
subject to PurchaserÂ’s prior written approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

shall provide Purchaser with copies of all of the Disposition Agreements and
related documentation for review not less than ten Business Days prior to the
execution thereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. The
Company shall incorporate in the Disposition Agreements and related

execute any such Disposition Agreements or related documentation until such
time as such Disposition Agreements and related documentation are in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. The Disposition shall be made
without any representation or warranty (express or implied) from the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and each Disposition Purchaser shall expressly
disclaim and have no recourse against Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Disposition or Disposed
Subsidiaries. The Disposition Purchasers will provide full and complete
indemnification against any all liabilities relating to the Disposition,
including any Disposed Liabilities.

Disposition (but for avoidance of doubt, prior to the Closing), the Company
shall, or shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries to, transfer the employment of
each employee thereof who is a Disposed Assets Employee to a Disposed
Subsidiary or a Disposition Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) each
Stock Option held by a Disposed Assets Employee that is outstanding pursuant
to its terms as of the Effective Time shall be treated in accordance with
Section 2.8(e) (and each such Disposed Assets Employee shall have executed an
Option Cancellation Agreement in respect thereof) and (ii) for purposes of
determining eligibility for a bonus under the Supplemental Bonus Plan, each
Disposed Assets Employee who is a participant thereunder and who remains
employed by a Disposed Subsidiary (or becomes employed by a Disposition
Purchaser) as of the Closing Date shall be treated as though he or she were an
employee of the Company or a Retained Subsidiary as of the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Supplemental Bonus Plan_. Prior to the Closing, the Company and
U.S. Corrugated, Inc. shall have obtained an agreement, in writing (in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser), from each participant in
the Supplemental Bonus Plan (a) acknowledging that the payment of a bonus in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
extinguish their rights under the Supplemental Bonus Plan and (b) releasing
and extinguishing any and all claims against Purchaser and its Affiliates in

the CompanyÂ’s 2011 capital expenditure budget (without respect to timing as
provided in such budget), which is set forth in _Section 5.9 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, consistent with past practice and in the ordinary course
of business as if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement were not
occurring.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Information Technology Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of the Retained Subsidiaries to, either
(a) remove from all servers and workstations any Software that is not owned by
or licensed pursuant to a valid license to the Company or such Retained
Subsidiary, as applicable, or (b) obtain a valid license to use such Software.
The actions required by this Section 5.10 shall in no way qualify or limit the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.12
(Intellectual Property) or otherwise in this Agreement, including for purposes
of determining whether the conditions set forth in Section 8.3 have been
satisfied.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Monthly Financial Statements_. As soon as available, but in any
event no later than 21 days after each calendar month-end following the date
of this Agreement that occurs prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Purchaser a copy of the CompanyÂ’s normal, internal operating
balance sheet and internal profit and loss statement (as such internal reports
are currently generated with respect to the Business); in each case both with
and without the Disposed Subsidiaries, the Disposed Assets and the Disposed
Liabilities. The financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to
this Section 5.11 shall in each case be prepared in accordance with the Agreed
Accounting Principles.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Transition Services Agreement_. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser
and the Company shall negotiate in good faith to agree upon final forms for

forms and schedules (or, if later, on the Closing Date), the Company and the

Agreements.

 



 

 _ARTICLE VI_

 



 

 _COVENANTS OF PURCHASER AND MERGER SUB_

 



 

Section 6.1 _Employee Retention; Compensation and Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement, for not less
than 12 months following the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Purchaser shall maintain, or, where applicable, shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries to maintain, plans, programs and
arrangements (including severance policies and programs but excluding stock
plans, other equity compensation arrangements, defined benefit pension plans,
retiree welfare benefit plans and those plans that are the subject of
collective bargaining) for the benefit of Employees who remain employed by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries during the Continuation Period that are not
less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Employees under
the Plans immediately prior to the date of this Agreement and, with respect to
Employees who are subject to collective bargaining, all benefits shall be
provided after the Effective Time in accordance with the applicable collective
bargaining agreement. In the event that any Employee is at any time after the
Effective Time transferred to Purchaser or any Affiliate

 



      
 

 



 

of Purchaser or becomes a participant in an employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement maintained by or contributed to by Purchaser or its Affiliates
(other than a Multiemployer Plan), Purchaser shall cause such plan, program or
arrangement to treat the prior service of such Employee with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent such prior service is recognized under
the comparable Plan, as service rendered to Purchaser or its Affiliates, as
the case may be; _provided, however,_ that in administering such plans,
programs or arrangements of Purchaser or its Affiliates, Purchaser may
disregard service or cause a reduction of benefits under any such plans,
programs or arrangements to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of
benefits with respect to the same covered matter or years of service and
_provided, further_ , that the foregoing shall only apply for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting in such plans, programs or arrangements
and for levels of benefits for purposes of vacation and severance, and shall
not apply for purposes of benefit accruals or any other purpose or under any
arrangement not specified in this Section 6.1(a). Nothing in this Agreement
shall limit PurchaserÂ’s or any of its AffiliatesÂ’ rights to terminate the
employment of any Employee or change the terms and conditions of employment of
any Employee. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to continue the employment of any Employee for any specific period.

 



 

(b) Purchaser will cause its medical, dental and other welfare plans in which
Employees or their dependants commence to participate after the Effective Time
to (i) (A) in the case of any self-insured benefit, waive, or (B) in the case
of any insured benefits, use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
applicable insurance provider to waive, any preexisting condition limitations
and (ii) (A) in the case of any self-insured benefit, honor, or (B) in the
case of any insured benefits, use commercially reasonable best efforts to
cause the applicable insurance provider to honor, any deductible and out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by such Employees and dependants for the same plan
year under similar plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the
plan year in which such participation begins. Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause to be waived any medical certification for
such Employees up to the amount of coverage such Employees had under any life
insurance plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor in accordance with their terms all Employment Agreements,
Contracts, policies and plans listed on _Section 6.1(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_.

 



 

(d) The Company agrees to terminate the employment of each employee of the
Company or a Retained Subsidiary whose termination is requested by written
notice to the Company given by Purchaser from time to time after the date
hereof but in no event less than ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing
(each, a " _Subject Employee_ "). With respect to each such Subject Employee
whose employment is terminated pursuant to this Section 6.1(d), the Company
shall be responsible for severance pay or other benefits incurred thereby in
connection with such termination of employment. Any termination of the
employment of a Subject Employee (i) shall be made in accordance with all
applicable Laws, (ii) shall be made in consultation with Purchaser, (iii)
shall only be made following the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act relating to the transaction contemplated
hereby, and (iv) shall be made prior to the Closing.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended (i) to require Purchaser,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to establish or maintain any
specific employee benefit plan or arrangement on and after the Closing Date,
or (ii) to create or amend any employee benefit plan or arrangement. Without
limiting the generality of the last sentence of Section 12.3, the provisions
of this Section 6.1 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this
Agreement, no Employee or any other Person shall be regarded for any purpose
as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Insurance; Indemnity_.

 



 

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under the applicable Company
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof each Person who is
now or has been an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (individually, a " _D andO Indemnified Person_" and collectively,
the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_"), against losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees),
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually incurred
by such DandO Indemnified Person in connection with any Proceeding arising out
of or pertaining to acts or omissions (other than illegal acts or acts of
fraud), or alleged acts or omissions (other than illegal acts or acts of
fraud), by them in their capacities as such, whether commenced, asserted or
claimed before or after the Effective Time; _provided, however,_ that no
indemnification shall be made to any DandO Indemnified Person to the extent it
is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (after all rights
to appeal shall have expired) that such DandO Indemnified Person did not, with
respect to the matter subject to indemnification hereunder, act in good faith
and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In the event of
any such Proceeding, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel selected in accordance with the requirements of
the Tail Policy, in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to
the full extent and under all circumstances permitted by the applicable
Company Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof, upon receipt
of any undertaking required by the applicable Company Organizational
Documents, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation will direct the defense of any
such matter; _provided further, however,_ that (A) the Surviving Corporation
shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) to pay the fees and
disbursements of more than one counsel for all DandO Indemnified Persons in any
single Proceeding, except to the extent that, in the opinion of counsel for
such DandO Indemnified Persons, two or more of such DandO Indemnified Persons have
conflicting interests in the outcome of such action and (B) in the event that
it is finally determined that any such DandO Indemnified Person is not entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.2, any amounts paid to such DandO
Indemnified Person hereunder shall be promptly reimbursed by such DandO
Indemnified Person to the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase tail insurance (the " _Tail Policy_ ") covering each Person who
was a director or officer of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company at
any time prior to the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time, on coverage terms
that are equivalent to the coverage terms of the policies of directorsÂ’ and

 



      
 

 



 

officersÂ’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance in effect for the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if the aggregate premium for such insurance exceeds 250% of the
per annum rate of premiums currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries
for such insurance, then Purchaser (or the Surviving Corporation) shall
purchase tail insurance providing for the maximum coverage that shall then be
available at a premium equal to 250% of such rate.

 



 

(c) Neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall, nor shall either
permit any of the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation to, take any
action directly or indirectly to disaffirm or adversely affect the provisions
of the Company Organizational Documents that provide indemnification of and
expense reimbursement to any DandO Indemnified Person as it relates to periods
prior to the Closing (except as required by Law); _provided, however_ , that,
subject to Section 6.2(e), nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall
prohibit or restrict the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any Retained
Subsidiary to merge with or into, or consolidate with, any Person, or to
liquidate or dissolve or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.2 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Person to whom this
Section 6.2 applies without the consent of such DandO Indemnified Person and
each party entitled to insurance coverage under this Section 6.2,
respectively, and his or her heirs and legal representatives, and shall be in
addition to any other rights a DandO Indemnified Person may have under the
Company Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, under applicable Law or otherwise.

 



 

(e) In the event Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.2.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Use of U.S. Corrugated Name_. Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation shall use their reasonable best efforts to discontinue any use of
the "U.S. Corrugated" trade name not later than 90 days following the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent such trade name appears on
or is incorporated into any inventory of the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries which existed as of the Closing Date, Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation shall be permitted to continue to sell indefinitely such
inventory without alteration in the normal course of business consistent with
past practice. From and after the Closing, Purchaser and Surviving Corporation
agree to indemnify, defend and save the Disposition Purchaser owning such
trade name harmless from and against any and all Losses sustained or incurred
by such Disposition Purchaser, directly caused by or directly resulting from
PurchaserÂ’s and/or the Surviving CorporationÂ’s use of the "U.S. Corrugated"
trade name pursuant to this Section 6.3. Such Disposition Purchaser shall be
permitted to undertake the defense of such matters at the expense of Purchaser
and the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.4 _Paying Agent Agreement_. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure the Paying Agent Agreement is in full force and effect upon
the Closing.

business hours and on reasonable notice to the officers, employees, premises,
properties, files, books, records, documents and other information of and
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries, including all such information
as Purchaser shall reasonably deem necessary to enable Purchaser and its
representatives to verify the accuracy of the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, to verify that the covenants of the Company and
its Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement have been complied with and to
determine whether the conditions set forth in Article VIII have been

between Purchaser or its representatives and such suppliers, distributors or
others, and (iv) shall instruct the employees, counsel and financial advisors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate reasonably with Purchaser and

_provided_ , _however_ , that any such access or furnishing of information
shall be conducted at the expense of Purchaser and Merger Sub, under the
supervision of the CompanyÂ’s personnel and in such a manner as not
unreasonably to interfere with the normal operations of the Company and the
Subsidiaries. For the purpose of facilitating such investigation, the Company

and Purchaser and Merger Sub agree that no communication shall be made by

or conduct business with any customer of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
the ordinary course of business unrelated to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

shall consult and fully cooperate with and provide assistance to each other in
obtaining all necessary consents, approvals, waivers, licenses, permits,
authorizations, registrations, qualifications or other permission or action
by, and giving all necessary notices to and making all necessary filings with

Purchaser agree to provide the other party, unless prohibited by Law, a
reasonable opportunity to participate in all telephonic conferences and all
meetings with a Governmental Entity. No party hereto shall consent to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the
other parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Each party hereto shall provide each other party
hereto with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between
them or any of their respective representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that such materials
may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of each of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, the Company and its Subsidiaries, (y) as

(i) (A) Purchaser shall not be obligated to contest any final action or
decision taken by the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity challenging the

Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries conduct their businesses in the future,
in each case to avoid, prevent or terminate any action by the Federal Trade
Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Entity which would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby; and

 



 

(ii) the Company shall not be obligated to, and except with the prior written
consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) shall not, make any agreement or understanding
affecting the Company, the Company Stock, the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries, the

or the respective assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
a condition for obtaining any consents or approvals required by any
Governmental Entity or other third party.

 



 

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Retained Subsidiaries to,
give as promptly as is reasonably practicable such notices to third parties
and use commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent, approval
or waiver, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, from
any party to any Material Contract or Software license required to be obtained
in order that such Material Contract or Software license will remain in full
force and effect, unchanged, upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to otherwise satisfy the conditions set
forth in Article VIII. In obtaining such consents, approvals or waiver,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (a)
modify or alter the terms of any applicable Material Contracts or Software
licenses or (b) make any payments of consideration or provide any other
inducement to any other parties to such Material Contracts or Software
licenses. Purchaser shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable best
efforts to assist the Company and its Subsidiaries in giving such notices and
obtaining such consents, approvals or waivers, provided that Purchaser shall
not be required to make any payments of consideration or provide any other
inducement to any other parties to such Material Contracts or Software
licenses.

(a) As soon as practicable, and in any event no later than ten Business Days
after the date hereof, each of the parties hereto shall file any Notification
and Report Forms and related material required to be filed by it with the
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice under the HSR Act with respect to transactions
contemplated hereby and shall promptly make any further filings pursuant
thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable. All such filings under the
HSR Act shall be in compliance in all material respects with the requirements
of the HSR Act, and each of the Company and Purchaser shall request early
termination of the waiting period required by the HSR Act. Each of Purchaser
and the Company shall furnish to the other such information and assistance as
the other shall reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any
submissions to, or agency proceedings by, any Governmental Entity under the
HSR Act or any comparable Laws of foreign jurisdictions, and each of Purchaser
and the Company shall keep the other promptly apprised of any communications
with, and inquiries or requests for information from, such Governmental
Entities.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, each of the Company and
Purchaser shall prepare and file any Other Filings required to be filed by
them. The Company and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other and provide to
each other all information necessary in order to prepare the Other Filings.
The information provided by the Company and Purchaser for use in the Other
Filings shall at all times prior to the Closing Date be true and correct in
all material respects and shall not omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make such information not false
or misleading. Each such filing shall, when filed, comply in all material
respects with applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Public Announcements_. Purchaser and the Company will consult
with each other before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as
may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with any securities
exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement unless the text of such statement shall first have been agreed to by
the parties hereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon
PurchaserÂ’s reasonable request (and at the expense of Purchaser), the Company
shall cooperate with and provide commercially reasonable assistance to
Purchaser and its Affiliates and representatives in making all required
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including by providing
financial information requested by Purchaser for the purposes of creating
financial statements (including pro forma financial statements) and
information to be filed therewith.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Notices of Certain Events_.

 



 

(a) During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the Closing
Date, each of Purchaser and the Company shall promptly notify the other in
writing following (i) the receipt of any notice or other communication from
any Governmental Entity or other third party in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or of any Proceeding commenced or, to its
knowledge, threatened against it which relates to or seeks to prohibit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) obtaining
knowledge of the occurrence or nonoccurence of any event occurring or not
occurring, as applicable, during the period beginning on the date hereof and
ending on the Closing Date, which is likely to result in any material failure
of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, subject to Section 12.15(a), the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 7.5(a) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to any of the parties receiving such notice.

 



 

(b) During the period prior to the Closing Date, the Company will promptly
notify Purchaser in writing of (i) any Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii)
any Proceeding that is threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which would have been required to be listed
on _Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ if such Proceeding had
arisen prior to the date hereof, (iii) any notice or other communication from
any third party alleging that the consent of such party is or may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv)
any material default under any Material Contract or other event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would become such a default on or prior to
the Closing Date.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 7.6 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1, the Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and the officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, agents, advisors, representatives and Affiliates of the Company
and its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, take any action to
solicit, encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any information to or enter into any agreement with any Person (other
than Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective representatives)
concerning (a) the acquisition or recapitalization of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (b) a merger, consolidation, stock exchange, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution business combination, or other similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (c) the acquisition of at
least 5% of the assets or equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than, in the case of assets, the sale of inventory in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice). The Company will
promptly cease or cause to be terminated any existing activities or
discussions with any Person (other than Purchaser, its Affiliates and their
respective representatives) with respect to any of the foregoing and will
promptly request the return of any confidential information previously
provided to any Person in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Periods Ending On or Before the Closing Date with Tax Returns Filed
After the Closing Date_. The Representative shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns required
to be filed by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof
for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the amended 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns
described in _Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_) and shall
timely pay or cause to be timely paid all of the Taxes due with respect to
such Tax Returns. Prior to filing any such Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence that is required to be filed following the Closing Date and
which relates solely to the Company and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries (or
if the Tax Return includes more than the Company or its Subsidiaries, only the
portion of such return that includes the Company and its Subsidiaries), the
Representative shall permit Purchaser a reasonable period of time to review
and comment on each such Tax Return and the Representative shall consider in
good faith making any changes reasonably requested by Purchaser prior to
filing such Tax Return, provided PurchaserÂ’s changes are consistent with prior
practice and permitted by applicable Law. Any amounts paid or caused to be
paid by the Representative pursuant to this Section 7.7(a) shall not reduce,
or otherwise be limited by, amounts in the Escrow Account.

 



 

(b) _Tax Periods Beginning on or Before and Ending After the Closing Date_. In
the case of any taxable period that includes but does not end on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), Taxes of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries (other than ad valorem Taxes) for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the day immediately prior to the Closing
Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other
pass-through entity in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time). The parties
agree that for purposes of the foregoing determination, any item of

 



      
 

 



 

income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that is attributable to (i) the Option Payments, the Company Bonus Payment or
the Warrant Payments or (ii) the Disposition shall be deemed to be
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. The amount of ad valorem Taxes of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period that relates to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on the day immediately prior
to the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days
in such Straddle Period.

 



 

(c) _Tax Accruals_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Securityholders shall not be obligated to pay any Taxes related to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (or indemnify Purchaser for the amount of such Taxes) to
the extent that such Taxes have been reflected as accrued liabilities on the
Final Closing Statement and specifically deducted in computing the Final
Closing Amount (but only to the extent of the amount so deducted).

 



 

(d) _Tax Refunds; Credits_ _._ Except (i) to the extent reflected as an asset
on the Final Closing Statement and specifically included in computing the
Final Closing Amount or (ii) as otherwise provided in this Section 7.7(d), the
Securityholders will be entitled to payment for all cash refunds or credits
against Tax of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period except for cash refunds or credits against Tax attributable to
carrybacks from any Post-Closing Tax Period. The Representative shall be
expressly entitled to elect to have the Company carry back losses from any
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period to the maximum extent allowed under Law in effect as of the Closing
Date to produce a cash refund in such earlier period and the Securityholders
will be entitled to payment for any such refund, but only to the extent the
losses so carried back are attributable to the Option Payments or the Warrant
Payments (it being understood that every dollar of loss so carried back that
is not in excess of the sum of any deductions attributable to the Option
Payments and Warrant Payments will be deemed attributable to the Option
Payments or the Warrant Payments). Any Tax Returns which must be filed in
order to claim the refunds described in this Section 7.7(d) shall be
considered Tax Returns described in Section 7.7(a) (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Representative must submit to Purchaser for review and comment
prior to filing in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
7.7(a)). If Purchaser or the Company receives any cash refund or benefit from
any credits against Tax (together with interest, if any, a " _Tax Benefit_ ")
to which the Securityholders are entitled pursuant to this Section 7.7(d),
Purchaser shall within ten Business Days following the receipt of any such Tax
Benefit pay (or cause the Company to pay) the entire amount of such Tax
Benefit to the Representative (for the benefit of Securityholders). Purchaser
agrees that, except as may be required by applicable Law, it shall not elect
to carry back any Post-Closing Tax losses to Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the
Company and its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

 



 

(e) _Cooperation and Control of Tax Disputes_.

 



 

(i) The parties hereto agree to cooperate with each other in the conduct of
any (i) contests concerning Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
due for any period or partial period and (ii) audits and other proceedings
conducted by Tax authorities with respect to Taxes of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for any such period.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser agrees to notify or will cause the Surviving Corporation to
notify the Representative in writing of any written notice of any contest,
audit or other proceeding (a " _Tax Claim_ ") in respect of Taxes for which
the Securityholders may be liable pursuant to this Section 7.7, within 30 days
of such receipt or such earlier time as would allow

 



      
 

 



 

the Representative to timely respond to such Tax Claim; _provided_ , that
failure to comply with this provision shall not affect PurchaserÂ’s right to
indemnification hereunder except to the extent such failure adversely affects
the RepresentativeÂ’s ability to contest any such Tax Claim in a material
manner.

 



 

(iii) The Representative may, at the expense of the Securityholders,
participate in and, upon notice to Purchaser, assume control of the defense of
any Tax Claim relating solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall include any portion of a Tax Claim determined to
relate solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to Section 7.7(e)(iv)),
whether such Tax Claim commenced before or commences after the Closing;
_provided_ , that the Representative shall have no right to represent the
CompanyÂ’s or any of its SubsidiariesÂ’ interests in any such Tax Claim unless
(A) the Representative shall have first notified Purchaser in writing of the
RepresentativeÂ’s intention to do so and the identity of counsel, if any,
chosen by the Representative and (B) the Representative agrees with Purchaser
that as between the Securityholders and Purchaser, the Securityholders shall
be liable for any Losses relating to Taxes that result from such Tax Claim and
(C) the Tax Escrow Amount (after reduction for all pending Tax Claims) (the "
_Available Amount_ ") equals or exceeds the reasonably determined maximum
amount of the Losses expected to be incurred, directly or indirectly, by the
Purchaser Group Members in connection with or arising from such Tax Claim
(such maximum amount, as determined from time to time, the " _Maximum
Liability Estimate_ "); _provided_ _further_ , that Purchaser shall have the
right to assume sole control from the Representative of any such Tax Claim at
any time after the Available Amount is determined in good faith by Purchaser
to be less than or equal to 100% of the Maximum Liability Estimate; _provided
further_ , that Purchaser and its representatives shall be permitted, at
PurchaserÂ’s expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such Tax Claim.
The Representative shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively or
after the commencement of litigation any Tax Claim which could adversely
affect the liability for Taxes of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation and any of its Subsidiaries) for any Post
Closing Tax Period without PurchaserÂ’s prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(iv) If a Tax Claim potentially involves Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods as
well as Taxes for Post-Closing Tax Periods, the parties hereto shall make
reasonable efforts to separate the Tax Claim into that portion relating to
Pre-Closing Tax Periods (which portion shall be subject to Section
7.7(e)(iii)) and that portion relating to Post-Closing Tax Periods (which
portion shall be subject to Section 7.7(e)(v)). In the event that any such Tax
Claim cannot be separated in such manner, Purchaser shall control such Tax
Claim; _provided_ , that the Representative shall be permitted, at the expense
of the Securityholders, to be present at, and participate in, any such Tax
Claim; _provided further_ , that except as provided in Section 7.7(e)(vii), in
no case will Purchaser be entitled to settle or otherwise compromise any such
Tax Claim with respect to any Taxes for which the Securityholders may be
liable pursuant to this Section 7.7 without the RepresentativeÂ’s prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

(v) Purchaser shall be entitled to control all Tax Claims relating solely to
Post-Closing Tax Periods or for which Purchaser has assumed control pursuant
to Section

 



      
 

 



 

7.7(e)(iii); _provided_ , that the Representative shall be permitted, at the
expense of the Securityholders, to be present at, and participate in, any such
Tax Claim relating in whole or in part to Taxes for which the Securityholders
may be liable pursuant to this Section 7.7.

 



 

(vi) Except as provided in Section 7.7(e)(vii), in no case will Purchaser be
entitled to settle or otherwise compromise a Tax Claim with respect to any
Taxes for which the Securityholders may be liable pursuant to this Section 7.7
without the RepresentativeÂ’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(vii) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.7(e) to the contrary,
Purchaser shall have the sole right to defend the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and to settle or otherwise compromise a Tax Claim with respect to
any issue arising in connection with any Tax Claim to the extent Purchaser
shall have agreed in writing to forego any indemnification under this
Agreement with respect to such issue.

 



 

(f) _Further Cooperation on Tax Matters_. From time to time after the Closing
Date, the parties hereto shall deliver to each other such information and
deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as any party may
reasonably request, taking into account that the books and records of the
Company and the Retained Subsidiaries will be in the possession of Purchaser
following the Closing, in connection with (i) the filing of any Tax Returns
that may be required to be filed by it, (ii) any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes, (iii) any customary Tax and accounting
procedures, and (iv) enabling such party to satisfy its internal accounting,
Tax and other requirements.

 



 

(g) _No Section 338(g) Election_. No election under Code Section 338(g) shall
be made with respect to the acquisition (or deemed acquisition) of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(h) _Indemnification_.

 



 

(i) From and after the consummation of the Closing, Purchaser hereby agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Securityholder Group Member from, and to
reimburse each Securityholder Group Member for, any and all Losses asserted
against, imposed upon or incurred by such Securityholder Group Member in
connection with, arising from, related to or which are the result of (A) any
Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period
beginning on or after the Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period
which is allocable to any period beginning on or after the Closing Date (each
a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ ") as determined under this Section 7.7, other
than any Taxes for which the Securityholders are liable pursuant to Section
7.7(h)(ii) and (B) 50% of any Transfer Taxes arising out of or in connection
with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Disposition). For the avoidance of
doubt, Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify, hold harmless or
reimburse any Securityholder Group Member pursuant to clause (A) of the
preceding sentence for any reduction in tax losses attributable to income or
gain of the Company for the portion of any Straddle Period which is allocable
to any period beginning on or after the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) From and after the consummation of the Closing, the Securityholders
hereby agree, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless each
Purchaser Group Member from, and to reimburse each Purchaser Group Member for,
any and all

 



      
 

 



 

Losses asserted against, imposed upon or incurred by such Purchaser Group
Member in connection with, arising from, related to or which are the result of
(A) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Company
made pursuant to Section 3.11 (Taxes) (without giving effect to any limitation
or qualification in any such representation or warranty as to Material Adverse
Effect, "material," "materiality," "in all material respects" or other similar
qualification set forth therein), (B) any breach by the Securityholders
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include a breach by the
Representative) of any of the covenants contained in this Section 7.7, (C)
without duplication, any Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
may otherwise be liable, that are attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including the portion of Taxes for any Straddle Tax Periods that are
allocated to a Pre-Closing Tax Period as determined under Section 7.7(b)), (D)
50% of any Transfer Taxes arising out of or in connection with the
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include the Disposition), (E) without duplication, any Taxes
(including Transfer Taxes) imposed on or with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a result of the Disposition and (F) without duplication,
any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any Disposed Subsidiary or the
Disposed Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, the Securityholders shall not be
required to indemnify, hold harmless or reimburse any Purchaser Group Member
pursuant to this Section 7.7(h)(ii) for any reduction in net operating losses
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period as a result of any Tax Claim relating
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, unless such Tax Claim results in a requirement to
pay Additional Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(iii) Purchaser shall be entitled to recover any Losses described in Section
7.7(h)(ii) by directing the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, to release that portion of the Tax Escrow Amount equal to the
amount of such Losses. PurchaserÂ’s sole recourse with respect to the
obligations of the Securityholders pursuant to this Section 7.7(h) shall be
recovery from the Tax Escrow Amount; _provided_ , that the foregoing
limitation on the SecurityholdersÂ’ obligations to indemnify Purchaser Group
Members shall not apply to any Purchaser Group Losses incurred (1) as a result
of any breach of the covenants in Section 7.7(a), in which case Purchaser may
be entitled to recovery for such covenant breach under Section 10.2(a)(iii),
or (2) as a result of any fraud by or on behalf of the Company in connection
with the negotiation or execution of this Agreement, in which case Purchaser
may be entitled to recover additional amounts pursuant to Section
10.2(a)(viii) or Section 10.3, as the case may be.

 



 

(i) _Survival of Obligations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in Sections
7.7(a), 7.7(d), 7.7(e), 7.7(f), and 7.7(g) shall be unconditional and absolute
and shall remain in effect without limitation as to time.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Substitution of Guarantees_. Purchaser and the Company shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to (a) cause Purchaser or an
Affiliate thereof to be substituted for the Company and/or its Affiliates in
those guarantees, letters of credit, indemnities or similar arrangements
entered into by the Company or any of its Affiliates listed on _Section 7.8
of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ (collectively, the " _Business Guaranties_
") and (b) cause the Company and/or its Affiliates to be fully released, in
each case, effective as promptly as practicable, in respect of all obligations
of the Company or any of its Affiliate under all such Business Guaranties. If
Purchaser and the Company are unable to effect such a substitution and release
with respect to any Business Guaranty after using reasonable best efforts to
do so,

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser shall indemnify the Securityholder Group Members from any Losses
incurred thereby arising from such Business Guaranty.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to arrange and
consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments, including its commercially reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain the Financing Commitments and negotiate and execute definitive
agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein,
which terms and conditions shall not expand upon the conditions to Closing or
other contingencies to the funding on the Closing Date of the Financing as set
forth in the Financing Commitments (the " _Financing Agreements_ "); (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in the Financing Commitments and the
Financing Agreements that are within its control; and (iii) draw upon and
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall deliver
to the Company a copy of the Financing Agreements as promptly as practicable
(and no later than two Business Days) after execution thereof. In the event
any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Financing Commitments or the Financing Agreements,
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
as promptly as practicable any such portion from alternative sources,
including, subject to Section 7.9(b), in an amount sufficient, when added to
the portion of the Financing that is available, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby
(the " _Alternative Financing_ ") and to obtain, and, when obtained, to
promptly provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that
provides for financing in an amount that is sufficient, when added to the
portion of the Financing that is available, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby
(the " _Alternative Financing Commitment_ ").

 



 

(b) To the extent applicable, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable best
efforts to arrange and consummate the Alternative Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Alternative Financing Commitment, including its
commercially reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain the Alternative Financing
Commitments and negotiate and execute definitive agreements with respect
thereto on terms and conditions contained therein, which terms and conditions
shall not expand upon the conditions to Closing or other contingencies to the
funding on the Closing Date of the Alternative Financing as set forth in the
Alternative Financing Commitments (the " _Alternative Financing Agreements_
"); (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in the Alternative Financing
Agreements within its control; and (iii) draw upon and consummate the
Alternative Financing at or prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall deliver to
the Company a copy of the Alternative Financing Agreements as promptly as
practicable (and no later than two Business Days) after execution thereof.
Neither the Alternative Financing Commitment nor the Alternative Financing
Agreements shall (x) expand upon the conditions precedent or contingencies to
the funding on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in the Financing
Commitments as in effect on the date of this Agreement or the Financing
Agreements or (y) prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall give the Company notice promptly upon becoming aware of
any material breach by any party to the Financing Commitments or the Financing
Agreements and, if applicable, the Alternative Financing Commitment or the
Alternative Financing Agreements, and Purchaser shall give the Company notice
promptly upon becoming aware of any termination of the Financing Commitments
or the Financing Agreements and, if applicable, the Alternative Financing
Commitment or the Alternative Financing Agreements. Purchaser shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and, if applicable, the
Alternative Financing. Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), amend, modify, supplement, restate, substitute or replace the
Financing Commitments, any Alternative Financing Commitment, any Financing
Agreement or any Alternative Financing Agreement in a manner that expands on
the conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding on the Closing Date
of the Financing or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing, as set forth in
such agreements in a manner that would reasonably be expected to materially
impair, delay or prevent the Closing or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to provide, and shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to
cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents to provide, all reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser and
that is customary in connection with PurchaserÂ’s efforts to obtain the
Financing or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing, including its
commercially reasonable best efforts to (i) provide financial and other
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the parties that
have committed to provide or otherwise entered into agreements in connection
with the Financing or, if applicable, the Alternate Financing (the "
_Financing Parties_ ") (including information to be used in the preparation of
an information package regarding the business, operations, financial
projections and prospects of Purchaser and the Company and its Subsidiaries
customary for such financing or reasonably necessary for the completion of the
Financing or, if applicable, the Alternate Financing by the Financing Parties
to the extent reasonably requested by Purchaser (including prior real estate
title commitments, surveys, environmental reports and similar information),
(ii) assist in the preparation of bank information memoranda and similar
documents (including historical and pro forma financial statements and
information) for the Financing or, if applicable, the Alternate Financing,
(iii) cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (and use
commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain from the CompanyÂ’s and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ advisors) customary certificates (including a certificate of the
principal financial officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to solvency matters), accounting comfort letters (including consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the
Financing or, if applicable, the Alternate Financing) or other documents and
instruments relating to guarantees and other matters ancillary to the
Financing or, if applicable, the Alternate Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Purchaser, (iv) assist in (A) the preparation of, entering into
and syndication of one or more credit agreements, note purchase agreements,
indentures, currency or interest hedging agreements or other agreements,
including by refraining from entering into any competing financing
transactions and (B) the amendment or termination of any of the CompaniesÂ’
existing credit

 



      
 

 



 

agreements, note purchase agreements, capital lease agreements, currency or
interest hedging agreements, letters of credit or other agreements, in each
case, on terms satisfactory to Purchaser and that are reasonably requested by
Purchaser in connection with the Financing or, if applicable, the Alternate
Financing, provided that no obligation of any Company under any such
agreements or amendments shall be effective until the Closing, (v) have the
independent accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries provide their
reasonable cooperation and assistance, (vi) cooperate reasonably with
PurchaserÂ’s financing sourcesÂ’ due diligence, to the extent customary and
reasonable and to the extent not unreasonably interfering with the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, (vii) refrain from pursuing any financing
transactions that may delay, impede or otherwise adversely affect the
Financing or, if applicable, the Alternate Financing and (viii) assist the
Financing Parties to benefit from the existing lending relationships of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that no requested
cooperation pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall delay the Closing and, until
the consummation of the Closing, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall (A) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee
or (B) have any liability or obligation under any credit agreement, note
purchase agreement, indenture, hedging agreement or other agreement or
document related to the Financing or, if applicable, the Alternate Financing.
Neither Purchaser nor the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be required by
this paragraph (d) to provide access to or to disclose (i) information that,
if provided, would adversely affect the ability of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to assert attorney-client or attorney work product privilege or a
similar privilege, (ii) information that, in the reasonable opinion of legal
counsel of the Company or its Subsidiaries, may result in a violation of any
applicable Law or any binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement or (iii) information that the Company reasonably believes is
competitively sensitive. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable

Section 7.10 _Title_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall cooperate with Purchaser to obtain, at least 20 days
prior to the Closing, title insurance commitments from Chicago Title Insurance
Company (the " _Title Company_ ") together with copies of all underlying title
documents referenced therein for each parcel of Real Property except for the

for (i) each parcel of Owned Real Property and (ii) the following Leased Real
Properties: (A) 655A Selig Drive in Atlanta, Georgia, (B) 400 Chandler Street
in Somerset, Kentucky, (C) 1001 Cale Drive in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky and (D)

be delivered to Purchaser Title Insurance Policies for each parcel of Real
Property except for the Corporate Headquarters. The cost to obtain such Title
Insurance Policies and Plats of Survey shall be paid by Purchaser.

 



 

(b) With respect to the Surveys and Title Insurance Commitments, Purchaser
shall have the right to object to any title exceptions or other matters
disclosed thereon which do not constitute Real Property Exceptions (any such
matters, " _Title Defects_ "). Any such objections with respect to any parcel
of Real Property must be made by written notice to the Company within 15 days
after the later to occur of (x) the date of receipt of the applicable Title
Insurance Commitment and (y) the date of receipt of the applicable Survey, and
Purchaser shall certify in any such written notice the date of receipt of such
Title Insurance Commitment and Survey. Purchaser may object to a Title Defect,
but the same shall be considered a Real Property Exception if (i) the Title
Company is willing to insure over such Title Defect (without additional cost
(other than costs that are nominal in amount) to Purchaser or where the
Company elects to pay such cost for PurchaserÂ’s account); (ii) the Title
Company is willing to provide affirmative insurance over such Title Defect
(without additional cost (other than costs that are nominal in amount) to
Purchaser or where the Company elects to pay such cost for PurchaserÂ’s
account); or (iii) if such Title Defect will be extinguished upon the transfer
of the affected Owned Real Property. The Company shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to cure or remove at or prior to the Closing, any Title
Defects; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will cause any deed to
secure debt, any deed of trust or any mortgage encumbering any Owned Real
Property to be satisfied or otherwise released on or before the Closing. In
the event that a Title Defect exists and Purchaser gives a timely notice of
objection to such Title Defect and the Company fails to cure or remove such
exception at or prior to Closing, Purchaser shall notify the Company in
writing prior to the Closing that it shall either (x) waive such objection and
proceed with the Closing notwithstanding such Title Defect, in which event
such Title Defect shall be deemed a Real Property Exception; or (y) terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g), if applicable. If Purchaser fails
to give such notice prior to the Closing, it shall be deemed to have exercised
election (x) in the immediately preceding sentence. All matters disclosed in
the Title Insurance Commitments or Surveys that are not objected to or with
respect to which PurchaserÂ’s objections are waived or deemed waived, shall be
Real Property Exceptions.

 



 

(c) With respect to each parcel of Real Property, the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser upon request such other documents and instruments relating to such
property as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser or required by the
Lenders, the costs of all of which shall be paid equally by Purchaser and the
Company. Such documents and instruments may include the following: (i) with
respect to any leases, subleases or occupancy agreements affecting any of the
Owned Real Property, subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreements
executed

 



      
 

 



 

by the landlord and tenant (or sublandlord and subtenant, as applicable)
thereunder in form and substance acceptable to Purchaser and, if applicable,
the Lenders, (ii) estoppel certificates executed by any tenant, subtenant or
occupant of any portion of the Owned Real Property and landlords under the
Leases or any other Person holding rights with respect thereto, certifying as
to such factual matters as Purchaser and, if applicable, the Lenders may
request; (iii) consents executed by the landlords under all of the DL-6 Leases
and the Lease at 700 N. Sam Houston Road, Mesquite, Texas allowing leasehold
mortgages to be placed on the Leased Real Property covered by such Lease in
favor of the Lenders in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Lender, provided that the lessor of such real property has received
subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreements in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to such lessors; (iv) a memorandum of lease in
recordable form with respect to each of the Leases (except for the Lease with
respect to the Corporate Headquarters) executed and acknowledged by the
landlords under the Leases or evidence that each Lease or a memorandum of
lease has been recorded in the relevant jurisdiction, to give constructive
notice to the third party purchasers of such Leases and conferring upon such
Lenders such other rights as such Lenders may require in order to preserve and
protect its liens, rights and interests in the Leased Real Property. The
Company shall use reasonable efforts to deliver to Purchaser a consent
executed by the landlord under the Lease at 1001 Cale Drive, Lawrenceburg
Kentucky allowing a leasehold mortgage to be placed on the Leased Real
Property covered by such Lease in favor of the Lenders in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Lender, provided that the lessor of such real
property has received a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment
agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such lessor.

Schedule_. From and after the date hereof, the parties hereto shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to identify any such Contracts
(each, a " _Shared Contract_ ") and shall cooperate with each other and use

Subsidiary, as applicable, prior to the Closing on terms and conditions
substantially similar to those contained in such Shared Contract as of the

the applicable counterparty to release the Securityholders and/or their
Affiliates (other than the Company and the Retained Subsidiaries, and
including the Disposed Subsidiaries) from any applicable obligations to the

Subsidiary under the Replacement Contract and (ii) to the extent the Company
or a Retained Subsidiary is a party to a Shared Contract, obtain the release
(effective as the Closing) of any counterparty of the Company or such Retained
Subsidiary, as applicable, from obligations arising after the Closing under
such Shared Contract. If one or more Replacement Contracts are not obtained
prior to or on the Closing Date, unless the parties hereto otherwise agree in
writing, during the remaining term of the applicable Shared Contract, such
parties shall use their

 



      
 

 



 

respective reasonable best efforts to allow the Company or the Retained
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and to
the extent reasonably within the contractual or other ability or control of
the parties hereto, as the case may be, to receive substantially the same
goods and services with respect to the subject matter of the Shared Contract
received prior to the Closing and to perform and comply with the economic and
other obligations of such Shared Contract. In connection with the foregoing
sentence, the parties agree to allocate all sharing discounts, incentives, and
rebates under each Shared Contract to the satisfaction of each party prior to
Closing.

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub;

 



 

(b) by either Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the

Section 7.3) has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, such action;

 



 

(c) by either Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the

pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) shall not be available to (i) any party whose
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement (including such partyÂ’s

before the Termination Date or (ii) the Company during the pendency of any
applicable cure period with respect to a Condition Failure Notice, a Title
Defect or a matter that would give rise to a right of Purchaser or Merger Sub
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e);

 



 

(d) by the Company if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
obligation, agreement or covenant made by Purchaser or Merger Sub in this
Agreement, such that the conditions in Section 8.2(a) and Section 8.2(b) are

Purchaser or Merger Sub prior to 30 days after receipt of written notice from
the Company requesting such breach to be cured; _provided_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) shall not be

such breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub;

 



      
 

 



 

(e) by Purchaser and Merger Sub if there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, obligation, agreement or covenant made by the
Company in this Agreement, such that the conditions in Section 8.3(a), Section

not have been cured by the Company prior to 30 days after receipt of written
notice from Purchaser requesting such breach to be cured; _provided_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) shall
not be available to Purchaser and Merger Sub if the failure of Purchaser to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement (including PurchaserÂ’s obligations
set forth in Section 7.2 and Section 7.3) has been the primary cause of, or
resulted in, such breach by the Company;

 



 

(f) by Purchaser and Merger Sub following receipt of a Condition Failure
Notice; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(f) shall expire at 11:59 p.m., Central time, on the tenth
Business Day after receipt of such Condition Failure Notice; or

 



 

(g) by Purchaser and Merger Sub if (i) there exists a Title Defect which shall

notice from Purchaser requesting such Title Defect to be cured and or (ii) the
Company fails to provide the documents set forth in Section 7.10(c) prior to
10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in each such case as a result of
which the condition set forth in Section 8.3(g) is not capable of being
satisfied.

 



 

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, this Agreement forthwith shall
become void and of no further force or effect, and no party hereto (or any of
its Affiliates, directors, officers, agents or representatives or the Lenders
or their Affiliates) shall have any liability or obligation hereunder, except
in accordance with Section 7.1, this Section 9.2 and Section 12.5 (and, to the
extent relevant thereto, Article XII), which shall survive any such
termination. Nothing in this Section 9.2 shall (a) be deemed to release any
party from any liability for any intentional or willful breach of any terms or
provisions of this Agreement, (b) impair the right of any party to compel
specific performance by any other party of its surviving obligations under
this Agreement or (c) affect the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.3 _Release of Deposit Amount_. In the event of any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to (a) Section 9.1(c), which termination pursuant to

condition set forth in Section 8.3(g) hereof, or (b) Section 9.1(d), the
Company and Purchaser shall promptly give joint written instructions to the
Deposit Agent to release the Deposit Amount to the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event of any termination of this Agreement for any
other reason, the Company and Purchaser shall promptly give joint written
instructions to the Deposit Agent to release the Deposit Amount to Purchaser;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the event the Closing occurs, the Company and
Purchaser shall promptly give joint written instructions to the Deposit Agent
to cause the Deposit Amount to be delivered by the Deposit Agent to the Escrow
Agent in accordance with Section 2.10(c).

 



      
 

 



 

 _ARTICLE X_

 



 

 _SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

Section 10.1 _Survival_. Except as provided for herein, none of the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3.1 (Organization and Qualification), Section 3.2
(Capitalization), Section 3.3 (Authorization and Validity of Agreement), and
Section 3.14 (Brokers and Finders), (b) the representations and warranties set
forth under Section 3.11 (Taxes) shall survive until the three month
anniversary of the expiration of the statute of limitations period applicable
to the matters covered thereby (after giving effect to any extension of waiver
thereof), (such representations and warranties set forth in clauses (a) and
(b) of the foregoing collectively, the " _Company Fundamental Representations_
") and (c) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1
(Organization and Qualification), Section 4.2 (Authorization and Validity of
Agreement) and Section 4.6 (Brokers and Finders) (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive indefinitely. All
covenants and other agreements set forth in this Agreement and the agreements
contemplated hereby with respect to matters to occur prior to the Closing
shall survive the Closing. No claim may be made for indemnification hereunder
for an inaccuracy or breach of any representation, warranty or covenant after
the expiration of the survival period applicable to such representation,
warranty or covenant set forth in this Section 10.1; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if Purchaser or the Representative, as applicable, delivers a written
notice to the other party of an indemnification claim for an inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant (stating in reasonable
detail the nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such claim for
indemnification) within the applicable time periods set forth above, such
claim shall survive until resolved or judicially determined.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Indemnification_. The parties hereto shall indemnify each other
as set forth below:

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article X, from and after the
consummation of the Closing, the Securityholders hereby agree, severally to

Member from, and to reimburse each Purchaser Group Member for, any and all
Losses asserted against, imposed upon or incurred by such Purchaser Group
Member in connection with, arising from, related to or which are the result of
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Group Losses_ "):

 



 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any Company Fundamental Representation (in
each case, without giving effect to any limitation or qualification in any
such representation or warranty as to Material Adverse Effect, "material,"
"materiality," "in all material respects" or other similar qualifications set
forth therein);

 



 

(ii) any liability of the Company or any Retained Subsidiary arising, existing
or incurred prior to the Closing or arising out of or relating to the Business
or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing,
whether absolute, accrued, contingent

 



      
 

 



 

or otherwise, and for which a Purchaser Group Member gives written notice to

Closing Date, other than (i) liabilities shown on the Latest Balance Sheet,
(ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices between the date of the Latest Balance Sheet and the Closing,
(iii) liabilities arising under this Agreement or in connection with the

disclosed in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule; (v) liabilities
that are disclosed in a Condition Failure Notice delivered prior to the
Closing in accordance with Section 12.15(a) of this Agreement;

 



 

(iii) any breach by the Company or the Representative of any of their
respective covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated hereby or any failure by the Company or the
Representative to perform any of their respective obligations hereunder or
thereunder;

 



 

(iv) the Disposition, including with respect to any Disposed Liabilities or
the Disposition Agreements, or any current or former Disposed Assets Employee
or any liability under Title IV of ERISA in connection with the Disposition;

 



 

(v) any amounts paid in accordance with Section 2.12 by Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation as consideration in respect of the Dissenting Shares
which is in excess of (A) the Adjusted Per Share Merger Consideration and any
Per Share Escrow Proceeds in respect thereof, if and when payable in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or (B) the Per Share
Class A Consideration, as applicable;

 



 

(vi) any Closing Indebtedness that remains unpaid following the Closing, other
than by reason of PurchaserÂ’s failure to satisfy its obligations under Section
2.10(b)(iv);

 



 

(vii) any amount paid by Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation in respect of
the deductible under the Environmental Insurance with respect to a claim
covered by the Environmental Insurance that relates to a property leased under
a DL-6 Lease;

 



 

(viii) any fraud by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement; and

 



 

(ix) the matters described on _Section 10.2(a)(ix) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no Purchaser Group Member shall be entitled
to indemnification under this Section 10.2(a) for any Losses to the extent a
reserve with respect to such Loss is taken into account in the calculation or
determination of the Final Closing Amount (such reserve to be reduced for
these purposes by the amount of any such Losses), (B) the Securityholders
shall not be responsible for any Purchaser Group Losses in respect of Section
10.2(a)(i) or Section 10.2(a)(ii) until the aggregate amount of all Purchaser
Group Losses exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), at which point the
Securityholders shall be responsible for all Purchaser Group Losses in excess
of the Basket Amount; and (C) the

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate indemnity obligation of the Securityholders for all Purchaser Group
Losses shall be limited to, and shall be satisfied solely from, the Indemnity
Escrow Amount.

 



 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article X, from and after the
consummation of the Closing, Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each Securityholder Group Member from, and to reimburse each
Securityholder Group Member for, any and all Losses asserted against, imposed
upon or incurred by such Securityholder Group Member in connection with,
arising from, related to or which are the result of (collectively, the "
_Company Group Losses_ "):

 



 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any Purchaser Fundamental Representation (in
each case, without giving effect to any limitation or qualification in any
such representation or warranty as to Material Adverse Effect, "material,"
"materiality," "in all material respects" or other similar qualification set
forth therein); and

 



 

(ii) any breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or any
failure by Purchaser or Merger Sub to perform any of its obligations hereunder
or thereunder;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) Purchaser shall not be responsible for any
Company Group Losses in respect of Section 10.2(b)(i) until the aggregate
amount of all of such Company Group Losses exceeds the Basket Amount, at which
point Purchaser shall be responsible for all Company Group Losses in excess of
the Basket Amount; and (B) the aggregate indemnity obligation of Purchaser for
all Company Group Losses in respect of Section 10.2(b)(i) shall in no event
exceed $16,500,000; _provided further_ , _however_ , that the limitations on
PurchaserÂ’s obligations to indemnity Securityholder Group Members set forth in
the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) shall not apply to any Company Group Losses
incurred as a result of any actual fraud on the part of Purchaser or Merger
Sub in connection with the negotiation or execution of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Any Purchaser Group Member or Securityholder Group Member (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article X
(each, an " _Indemnification Event_ ") shall give written notice (an "
_Indemnification Claim_ ") to the party from which such indemnification is
sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") describing in reasonable detail the
Indemnification Event and the basis on which indemnification is sought. If the
Indemnifying Party is not so notified by the Indemnified Party promptly after
the date of the receipt by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates of
notice of, or of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates otherwise
becoming aware of, any particular Indemnification Event, the Indemnified
PartyÂ’s rights under this Article X shall not be affected except to the extent
such failure is actually prejudicial in any material respect to the rights and
obligations of the Indemnifying Party. After the giving of any Indemnification
Claim pursuant to this Article X, the amount of indemnification to which an
Indemnified Party shall be entitled hereunder shall be determined by (i)
written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party,
(ii) a final judgment or decree of any arbitrator or court of competent
jurisdiction or (iii) any other means to which the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall agree in writing. The judgment or decree of an
arbitrator or court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,

 



      
 

 



 

if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all
appeals taken shall have been finally determined.

 



 

(d) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event that any written claim or demand for
which an Indemnifying Party may have liability to any Indemnified Party
hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified
Party by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party
shall (1) promptly, but in no event more than 60 days following receipt of
such Third Party Claim, deliver written notice to the Indemnifying Party of
such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
indemnification hereunder shall not be affected by any failure of the
Indemnified Party to give such notice (or by delay by the Indemnified Party in
giving such notice) unless, and then only to the extent that, the rights and
remedies of the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced as a result of
the failure to give, or delay in giving, such notice, and (2) permit the
Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost and expense and upon written notice to
the Indemnified Party within 30 days after the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s receipt of
such written notice of the Third Party Claim (or such shorter time period as
may be necessary to avoid prejudicing the rights and remedies of the
Indemnified Party thereunder), to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, if the relief
claimed (and, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnifying Party, is
reasonably likely to be granted if the Third Party Claim is successful)
relates only to money damages in an amount not reasonably expected to
materially exceed the then available amount of Indemnity Escrow Amount or the
Tax Escrow Amount, as the case may be, does not seek injunctive or equitable
relief and would not reasonably be expected to involve material reputational
harm to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. Such defense shall be
conducted diligently and in good faith. The Indemnifying Party shall keep the
Indemnified Party reasonably apprised of the status of the Third Party Claim
and any resulting suit or proceeding, furnish such Indemnified Party with all
documents and information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party and
shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any such Third Party Claim or any resulting suit or proceeding, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). If the Indemnifying Party is
not entitled to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with
this Section 10.2(d), or if the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense
of any Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 10.2(d), the
Indemnified Party may defend against such Third Party Claim in such manner as
it reasonably deems appropriate.

 



 

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall each cooperate
fully (and shall each cause its Affiliates to cooperate fully) with the other
in the defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 10.2(d). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each such Person shall furnish the
other such Person (at the expense of the Indemnifying Party) with such
documentary or other evidence as is then in its or any of its AffiliatesÂ’
possession as may reasonably be requested by the other Person for the purpose
of defending against any such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(f) Following the consummation of the Closing, except with respect to the
matters covered by Sections 2.11, 6.2, 6.3, 7.7, 7.8 or 12.4, or any remedies
for fraud the rights and remedies of the Purchaser Group Members and
Securityholder Group Members under this

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.2 are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and
remedies which Purchaser or the Purchaser Group Members and Securityholder
Group Members, as the case may be, may have against the other under this
Agreement (i) with respect to (A) the breach or inaccuracy of any
representation, warranty, certification or other statement made (or deemed
made) thereby pursuant to this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule,
as the case may be, or (B) any breach of, or failure to perform or comply
with, any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or (ii) otherwise
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For avoidance
of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to limit the
availability of any remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law.

 



 

(g) If at any time subsequent to the receipt by an Indemnified Party of an
indemnity payment hereunder, such Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof)
receives any recovery, settlement or other similar payment with respect to the
Loss for which it received such indemnity payment (the " _Recovery_ "), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal
to the amount of such Recovery, less any expense incurred by such Indemnified
Party (or its Affiliates) in connection with such Recovery (the " _Recovery
Payment_ "), but in no event shall any such Recovery Payment exceed the amount
of such indemnity payment; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that the
Indemnified Party is Purchaser and the Escrow Fund exists at the time
Purchaser is required to make a Recovery Payment to the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 10.2(g), Purchaser shall deliver such Recovery
Payment to the Escrow Agent for deposit into the Escrow Fund pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement in lieu of delivering such Recovery Payment to the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(h) Any payment made by Purchaser or the Securityholders pursuant to this
Section 10.2 shall be deemed an adjustment in the Final Closing Amount. The
amount of any Losses will be reduced by the amount actually recovered by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation and
any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party under any contract with such
party or under any applicable insurance policy.

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall be entitled to recover any Purchaser Group Losses pursuant
to this Section 10.2 by directing the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, to release that portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
equal to the amount of such Purchaser Group Losses.

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 10.2 shall
have no application to claims for indemnification for Taxes (including a claim
for a breach or inaccuracy of representations and warranties pursuant to
Section 3.11 (Taxes)), which are governed exclusively by the provisions of
Section 7.7; _provided, however,_ indemnification pursuant to this Section
10.2 shall be applicable with respect to a breach of the covenants set forth
in Section 7.7(a).

 



 

Section 10.3 _Mehiel Liability_. Dennis Mehiel and Dennis Dorian Mehiel shall
be jointly and severally liable (for the avoidance of doubt, without regard
for any of the limitations set forth in this Article X) for any fraud by or on
behalf of either Dennis Mehiel or Dennis Dorian Mehiel in connection with the
negotiation or execution of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 _ARTICLE XI_

 



 

 _REPRESENTATIVE_

 



 

Section 11.1 _Appointment of Representative_.

 



 

(a) Dennis Mehiel (and any of his successors or assigns) is hereby appointed
to act as the Representative under this Agreement for the Securityholders and,
as such, to act as agent (with full power of substitution) of the
Securityholders, to take such action on such SecurityholdersÂ’ behalf with
respect to all matters relating to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
including to make all determinations, agreements and settlements relating to
the Final Closing Statement, Tax matters under Section 7.7 and the
indemnification provisions of Article X, to sign receipts, consents and other
documents to effect any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in
connection with the foregoing. All such determinations, agreements,
settlements and compromises made by the Representative shall be binding on all
of the Securityholders, regardless of whether such Securityholders are
presented with and executed an Approval Consent. The Representative shall not
have any duties or responsibilities except those contemplated by this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or shall otherwise exist against the Representative.

 



 

(b) The parties to this Agreement agree that Purchaser, Merger Sub and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the instructions,
decisions and acts of the Representative required, permitted or contemplated
to be taken by the Representative hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement, and
Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with any
instructions, decisions or acts of the Representative. The parties to this
agreement further agree that Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to treat as genuine, and as the document it purports to be, any
letter, paper or other document furnished to it by or on behalf of the
Representative, and reasonably believed by Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Escrow
Agent to be genuine and to have been signed and presented by the proper party
or parties.

 



 

(c) The Representative shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected
in relying, upon any statements furnished to it by any Securityholder,
Purchaser or Merger Sub, or any other evidence deemed by the Representative to
be reliable, and the Representative shall be entitled to act on the advice of
counsel selected by it.

 



 

(d) The Representative shall be entitled to retain counsel and other advisors
and to incur such expenses as the Representative deems to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Each Securityholder shall be deemed to
have hereby irrevocably granted the Representative exclusive and full power
and authority in the name and on behalf of such Securityholder to set aside
from the amounts to be paid to the Securityholders at Closing an aggregate
amount in cash equal to the Representative Reserve Amount to be used to fund
the reimbursement of expenses of the Representative as authorized by this
Article XI, which amount shall be deducted proportionately

 



      
 

 



 

on a pro rata basis based on such SecurityholderÂ’s Percentage Interests and
held for the benefit of such Securityholder, and any portion of the
Representative Reserve Amount not used to fund the reimbursement of the
expenses of the Representative pursuant to this Agreement shall be released in
such same proportions to each Securityholder upon the later of (i) the final
distribution to the Securityholders of all remaining amounts of the Escrow
Fund pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, or (ii) as otherwise determined by the
Representative in its sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Representative reasonably determines that any such amounts are necessary for
the Representative to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, such
amounts shall not be distributed to the Securityholders until the
Representative reasonably determines that such amounts are no longer necessary
for such purpose. All expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses
incurred by the Representative in fulfilling the duties of the Representative
as agent for the Securityholders, shall be paid from the Representative
Reserve Amount. Each Securityholder shall be deemed to have hereby irrevocably
appointed the Representative exclusive and full power and authority to invest
any such amounts in its sole discretion. Any losses suffered as a result of
any such investments shall be borne only by the Securityholders and any
interest accrued on any such investments shall be allocated among and released
to the Securityholders in the same manner as provided above with respect to
the release of any portion of the Representative Reserve Amount. If the
Representative, in connection with acting in such capacity, shall incur any
loss, cost or expense that is not reimbursed from the Representative Reserve
Amount, each Securityholder shall be deemed to have agreed, at the written
request of the Representative, to reimburse the Representative for a
proportionate amount thereof, determined on a pro rata basis based on such
SecurityholdersÂ’s Percentage Interests (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall not be taken out of the Escrow Account); _provided, however_ , that such
reimbursement obligation shall be limited to the aggregate proceeds received
by such Securityholder in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(e) The Representative shall incur no liability to the Securityholders with
respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in reliance upon any
notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other documents believed
by it to be genuinely and duly authorized, nor for any other action or
inaction except its own willful illegal acts or acts of fraud. The
Securityholders shall be deemed to have agreed that the Representative is
acting solely on behalf of and as agent for the Securityholders and not in its
personal capacity and in no event shall the Representative be personally
liable to the Securityholders hereunder except as expressly provided in the
first sentence of this Section 11.1(e). The Securityholders shall indemnify
the Representative (in its capacity as such) ratably according to their
respective ownership interests in the Company against, and shall hold the
Representative (in its capacity as such) harmless from, any and all losses of
whatever kind which may at any time be imposed upon, incurred by or asserted
against the Representative in such capacity in any way relating to or arising
out of its action or failures to take action pursuant to this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement or in connection herewith or therewith in such capacity
(other than in the case of illegal acts or acts of fraud by the
Representative). The agreements in this Section 11.1 shall survive termination
of this Agreement.

Section 12.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules,
exhibits and other documents and instruments referred to herein or
contemplated hereby), together with the Confidentiality Agreement referred to
in Section 7.1, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior written or
oral and all contemporaneous oral agreements and understandings between any of
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

Section 12.3 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned, in whole or in
part, by any party hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. The preceding sentence
notwithstanding, Purchaser and Merger Sub may assign this Agreement or all or
any part of their rights and obligations under this Agreement, following
written notice to the Representative, (i) to an Affiliate of Purchaser, (ii)
to any subsequent purchaser of Purchaser or substantially all of its assets
(whether such sale is structured as a sale of stock, a sale of assets, a
merger or otherwise) and (iii) to any of their respective lenders (including
Bank of America, N.A., as agent) as collateral security; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations
under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person, other than the
parties or their respective successors and assigns and, (a) with respect to
Sections 2.8, 2.10, 7.7 and 10.2, the holders of Stock Options, (b) with
respect to Sections 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 7.7 and 10.2, the
Stockholders, (c) with respect to Section 6.3, the Disposition Purchasers, and
(d) with respect to Section 6.2, the DandO Indemnified Persons, in each case to
the extent such Persons are not parties hereto, any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.4 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed by the Company, Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Representative
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that, in such event, such
parties could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone.
Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity (including
monetary damages), Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company and the Representative
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement,
including temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of any of the terms of this Agreement. Each
party hereto (i) agrees that it shall not oppose the granting of such specific
performance or relief and (ii) hereby irrevocably waives any requirement for
the security or posting of any bond in connection with such relief.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 12.5 _Fees and Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants) shall be borne by the party which incurs such cost or expense;
_provided_ , that all fees incurred in connection with any (i) filings under
the HSR Act and (ii) Other Filings shall be borne equally by Purchaser, on the
one hand, and by the Company, on the other hand.

 



 

Section 12.6 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time prior to the Closing Date without further action by any
other Securityholders; _provided_ , that this Agreement may not be amended or
modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

 



 

Section 12.7 _Waivers_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the Company,
on the one hand, or Purchaser or Merger Sub, on the other hand, may, to the
extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time specified herein for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by
the other with any of the agreements or covenants of such other party or
parties (as the case may be) contained herein. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
the party or parties to be bound thereby. No such extension or waiver shall
constitute a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
breach or failure to strictly comply with the provisions of this Agreement.
The failure of any party to insist on strict compliance with this Agreement or
to assert any of its rights or remedies hereunder or with respect hereto shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

 



 

Section 12.8 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated thereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 12.9 _Captions_. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(including by means of facsimile), each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same
instrument.

 



 

Section 12.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to
contracts executed in and to

 



      
 

 



 

be performed in that State, without regard to its principles of conflicts of
law that would result in the application of any laws other than the laws of
the State of New York.

 



 

Section 12.12 _Arbitration_.

 



 

(a) This Section 12.12 shall not be of any force or effect unless and until
the Closing shall have occurred. From and after the Closing, except with
respect to any Proceeding initiated to assert a fraud claim or as otherwise
expressly set forth in any other provision of this Agreement, including
Section 2.11, subject to Section 12.12(b), any dispute, controversy or claim
between the parties to this Agreement arising from or in connection with this
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby whether based on
contract, tort, common law, equity, statute, regulation, order or otherwise (a
" _Dispute_ "), regardless of the magnitude thereof or the amount in
controversy, shall be submitted to, and finally determined by, arbitration in
accordance with the following provisions of this Section 12.12(a):

 



 

(i) Any such arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration
Association (" _AAA_ ") in accordance with the AAA Commercial Rules (" _AAA
Rules_ "), except as the AAA Rules conflict with the provisions of this
Section 12.12, in which event the provisions of this Section 12.12 shall
control.

 



 

(ii) The arbitral panel (the " _Panel_ ") shall consist of three arbitrators
independent of the parties (the " _Arbitrators_ "). The Arbitrators shall be
appointed pursuant to AAAÂ’s procedure for selecting arbitrators as described
in the AAA Rules. Each Arbitrator shall be either an attorney or business
person knowledgeable in commercial matters and have at least ten yearsÂ’
experience in his field of expertise.

 



 

(iii) The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New York or in such
other location as the parties may designate by mutual written consent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Panel may from time to time convene, carry
on hearings, inspect property or documents, and take evidence at any location
which the Panel deems appropriate.

 



 

(iv) The Panel may in its discretion order a pre-hearing exchange of
information including production of documents, exchange of summaries of
testimony or exchange of statements of position, and shall schedule promptly
limited discovery (to the extent necessary and appropriate) and other
procedural steps and otherwise assume case management initiative and control
to effect an efficient and expeditious resolution of the Dispute.

 



 

(v) At any oral hearing of evidence in connection with an arbitration pursuant
to this Section 12.12, each party and its legal counsel shall have the right
to examine its witnesses and to cross-examine the witnesses of the other
party. No testimony of any witness shall be presented in written form unless
the opposing party or parties shall have the opportunity to cross-examine such
witness, except as the parties otherwise agree in writing or except under
extraordinary circumstances where, in the opinion of the Panel, the interests
of justice require a different procedure.

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) Within 15 days after the closing of the arbitration hearing, the Panel
shall prepare and distribute to the parties a written award setting forth the
PanelÂ’s findings of facts and conclusions of law relating to the Dispute,
including the reasons for the giving or denial of any award or relief. Except
as necessary in court Proceedings to enforce this arbitration provision or an
award rendered or relief granted hereunder as required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange or to comply with applicable accounting
and Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure obligations, or to obtain
interim relief, no party hereto nor an Arbitrator may disclose the existence,
content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written
consent of each of Purchaser and the Representative.

 



 

(vii) The parties hereto consent to the jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts specified in Section 12.13 with respect to such arbitration and further
consent that any notice of arbitration upon the other party hereto by the
party instituting such arbitration shall be deemed sufficient if made in
accordance with Section 12.13, and that such notice shall have the same effect
as if personal service of notice had been made. A judgment upon the award
rendered by the Panel may be entered in any court specified in Section 12.13
or in any other court having jurisdiction over the relevant parties.

 



 

(viii) Purchaser and the Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders)
agree to share equally the cost of any administrative fee, any compensation of
the Arbitrators and any expenses of any witnesses or proof produced at the
direct request of the Panel, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Panel, in its
discretion, may allocate such fees and expenses between the parties in any
manner it deems appropriate to reflect (i) the decision or any award of the
Panel, (ii) each partyÂ’s efforts to comply with this Section 12.12 in good
faith or (iii) such factors as the Panel deems relevant.

 



 

(ix) The parties shall each bear all their own costs and attorneysÂ’ fees and
expenses of arbitration.

 



 

(x) The Panel shall not have the power or authority to award punitive or
indirect damages (other than those required to be paid to a third party
pursuant to a Third-Party Claim pursuant to a final, non-appealable order).
Otherwise, the Panel shall have the authority to grant any other relief a
court of competent jurisdiction could grant, including an injunction or other
equitable relief.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the Dispute resolution procedures contained in this
Section 12.12, (i) nothing in this Section 12.12 shall prohibit any party
hereto from joining another party in a Proceeding initiated by a Person that
is not a party hereto and (ii) any party hereto may apply to any court
specified in Section 12.13 (A) to enforce this agreement to arbitrate, (B) to
seek provisional injunctive relief so as to enforce any agreements in this
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby until the arbitration
award is rendered or the Dispute is otherwise resolved, (C) to avoid the
expiration of any applicable limitation period, (D) to preserve a superior
position with respect to other creditors, (E) to challenge or vacate any final
judgment, award or decision of the Panel that does not comport with the
express provisions of this Section 12.12 or (F) to enforce any provision of
this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

hereby that provides for specific performance, a restraining order, a
permanent or temporary injunction or other equitable remedy.

 



 

Section 12.13 _Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process_. Subject to the duty
to arbitrate in Section 12.12, each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally consents and agrees to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and of the United States
of America, in each case located in the County of New York or the Southern
District of New York, as applicable, for any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and
agrees not to commence any Proceeding relating thereto except in such courts),
and further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by
U.S. registered mail to its respective address set forth in Section 12.1 (with
copies to such other Persons as specified therein) shall be effective service
of process for any Proceeding brought against it in any such court. Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the courts of the State of New York or the
United States of America, in each case located in the County of New York or
the Southern District of New York, as applicable, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



 

Section 12.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND SUBJECT
TO THE DUTY TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 12.12, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY HERETO
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III)
IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 12.14.

 



 

Section 12.15 _Disclosure Schedules_.

 



 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries may, from time to time, prior to or at
the Closing (but in no event less than ten Business Days prior to the Closing
Date) by written notice to Purchaser and Merger Sub, update or supplement the
Company Disclosure Schedule in order

 



      
 

 



 

to disclose any New Matter (the Company Disclosure Schedule, as so updated or
supplemented, the " _Updated Schedules_ "). None of such Updated Schedules
will be deemed to cure the representations and warranties to which such
matters relate with respect to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.3(a) or otherwise affect any other term or condition contained in
this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, indemnification rights
under Article X), except as provided in the immediately following sentence. If
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provides written notice to Purchaser
concurrently with the delivery of the Updated Schedules (such notice, a "
_Condition Failure Notice_ ") that, as a result of the New Matters described
in such Condition Failure Notice and the accompanying Updated Schedules, the
conditions set forth in Section 8.3(a) will not be satisfied at the Closing,
Purchaser shall have until the earlier of (i) ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of such Condition Failure Notice and (ii) two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date to notify the Company of PurchaserÂ’s termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f); _provided_ , _however_ , if Purchaser
does not exercise such termination right within the specified time period,
then the New Matters disclosed in the Updated Schedules shall qualify the
representation or warranty to which they relate for purposes of Article X and
Purchaser shall be barred from seeking indemnification for Losses with respect
to a breach or inaccuracy of such representation or warranty.

 



 

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule will
not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by
virtue of the inclusion of such information in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, that such information is required to be listed in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or that such items are material to the Company or its
Subsidiaries. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the
Company Disclosure Schedules are inserted for convenience only and will not be
deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to those contained
in this Agreement merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a particular
covenant, representation or warranty will be deemed adequately disclosed as an
exception with respect to all other covenants, representations or warranties
to the extent that the relevance of such item to such other covenants,
representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such item,
notwithstanding the presence or absence of any disclosure thereof in an
appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to such
other covenants, representations or warranties or an appropriate cross-
reference thereto.

 



 

Section 12.16 _No Presumption_. With regard to each and every term and
condition of this Agreement and any and all agreements and instruments subject
to the terms hereof or referred to herein, the parties hereto understand and
agree that the same have or has been mutually negotiated, prepared and
drafted, and if at any time the parties hereto desire or are required to
interpret or construe any such term or condition or any agreement or
instrument subject hereto, no consideration shall be given to the issue of
which party hereto actually prepared, drafted or requested any term or
condition of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument subject hereto.

 



 

 _Section 12.17 Claims Against Debt Financing Sources_. Subject to the rights
of the parties to the Financing Commitments under the terms thereof, none of
the parties hereto, nor or any of their respective Affiliates, solely in their
respective capacities as parties to this Agreement, shall have any rights or
claims against the Lenders, any other financing sources of the Financing or
any Affiliate thereof (collectively, the " _Debt Financing Sources_ "), solely
in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the
Financing, and the Debt Financing Sources, solely in their respective
capacities as lenders or arrangers, shall not have any rights or claims
against any party hereto or any related person thereof, in connection with
this Agreement or the Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, each of the parties hereto (x)
agrees that it will not, and will not permit any of its Affiliates to, bring
or support any action or proceeding (whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) against a Debt Financing Source in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
Commitments or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable
Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof) and (y) waives any right to trial by jury in respect of any such
claim, suit, action or proceeding. The provisions of this Section, as well as
Section 9.2, shall be enforceable by each Debt Financing Source, its
Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns as express
third-party beneficiaries.
