Indebtedness and shall take such commercially reasonable actions as may be
necessary to facilitate such repayment and to facilitate the release,
in connection with such repayment, of any Liens securing such Senior
Indebtedness.



(b) Immediately following the Fourth Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or
cause to be provided, sufficient funds to Third Surviving Corporation to
enable Third Surviving Corporation to repay all indebtedness then outstanding
under the Companys notes issued pursuant to that certain Indenture dated as
of February 2, 2000 among the Company, the guarantors named therein and
Bankers Trust Company as trustee (the " _Subordinated Indebtedness_ "). Each
of Parent, Merger Subs and the Company shall cooperate in connection with the
repayment of such Subordinated Indebtedness and shall take such
commercially reasonable actions as may be necessary to facilitate such
repayment and to facilitate the release, in connection with such repayment, of
any Liens securing such Subordinated Indebtedness.



 

27 Section 3.7 _Working Capital Adjustment_.



(a) _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_.



(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Selling Companies shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, in good faith an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the
Selling Companies and their Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ ") prepared in accordance with GAAP using
the Working Capital Accounting Principles, and a calculation based upon such
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet setting forth in reasonable detail as of
immediately prior to the scheduled Closing the estimated amount of Net Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "). Not later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Selling Companies shall deliver
to Parent (A) the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, together with worksheets
and data that support the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated
Net Working Capital and (B) a certificate of an executive officer of each of
the Selling Companies certifying that the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and
the Estimated Net Working Capital were prepared in accordance with this
Section 3.7. Each of the Selling Companies shall also certify that, assuming
that Parent pays off all of the outstanding Indebtedness of the Selling
Companies and their Subsidiaries, immediately following the Effective Times,
the Selling Companies and their Subsidiaries shall have no Indebtedness
outstanding. The Selling Companies shall give, and shall cause its advisers to
give, Parent and its advisers reasonable access to such books, records and
personnel of the Selling Companies (including the work papers of the Selling
Companies and their accountants relating to the preparation of the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net Working Capital) as may
be necessary to enable Parent and its advisers to review the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net Working Capital prior to the
Closing. Parent shall have five (5) Business Days following the receipt of the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet to review the same and the calculation of the
Estimated Net Working Capital. On or prior to the expiration of such five-
Business Day period, Parent may deliver to the Selling Companies a written
statement (" _Parent Notice_ ") accepting or objecting in good faith to the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and/or the calculation of the Estimated Net
Working Capital (or any portion thereof). In the event that Parent shall
object to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Estimated Net
Working Capital, such Parent Notice shall include a detailed itemization of
Parents objections and reasons therefor, and prior to the Closing, Parent and
the Company shall in good faith mutually agree on the amount of Estimated Net
Working Capital. If Parent does not deliver the Parent Notice to the Selling
Companies within such five-Business Day period, Parent shall be deemed to have
accepted the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the
Estimated Net Working Capital; _provided_ that, nothing in this Section
3.7(a)(i) shall prohibit or otherwise limit Parent or the Selling Companies in
any way from making any change or objection (including, without limitation,
a change or objection not otherwise raised with respect to the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Estimated Net Working Capital) pursuant to
Section 3.8 following the Closing.



(ii) As provided in Section 3.1(a) hereof, the Adjusted Cash Consideration to
be paid at Closing shall be adjusted, dollar for dollar, up or down, as
appropriate, to the extent that the Estimated Net Working Capital agreed upon
in  



 

28  accordance with the provisions of Section 3.7(a)(i) exceeds or is less than
the Base Net Working Capital.



(b) For purposes of this Section 3.7 and Section 3.8 below, " _Net Working
Capital_ " means Current Assets minus Current Liabilities; " _Current Assets_
" means and includes all accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, prepaid
expenses and Intercompany Receivables and specifically excludes cash, cash
equivalents, and deferred Taxes, in each case as determined in accordance with
GAAP, consistently applied; and " _Current Liabilities_ " means and includes
all accounts payable, accrued expenses (other than expenses with respect to
the Senior Indebtedness and the Subordinated Indebtedness), Intercompany
Payables and accrued but unpaid Taxes (giving effect to the utilization of
current period Tax losses and Tax net operating losses solely for the purpose
of determining Taxes payable from periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, and excluding any general Tax reserve not specifically owing as of the
Closing Date for periods prior to the Closing Date), and deferred revenues,
in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of accrued but unpaid Taxes of
the Selling Companies and their Subsidiaries shall be determined by excluding
the effect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Spin-Off shall be given effect for purposes of
calculating accrued but unpaid Taxes (giving effect to the utilization of all
available Tax basis, current period Tax losses and Tax net operating losses
solely for the purpose of determining Taxes payable from periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date), and _provided_ , _further_ , that a deduction for
the payment of each item of Transaction Expenses shall be given effect for
purposes of calculating accrued but unpaid Taxes, but only to the extent that
an opinion of tax counsel selected by the Selling Companies and reasonably
acceptable to Parent (with Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Ernst and Young LLP being
deemed to be acceptable to Parent for this purpose) to the effect that the
deduction of such items is more likely than not the proper treatment of such
items. Furthermore notwithstanding any provision of GAAP to the contrary, for
all purposes of the calculation of Net Working Capital, Current Liabilities
shall include any and all unpaid expenses related to the Mergers or the
transactions contemplated herein payable by the Selling Companies and their
Subsidiaries, but shall be deemed to be limited to any attorneys fees,
investment banking fees, accountant fees, and any expenses related to the
purchase of an extended reporting period endorsement under each of the Selling
Companies existing directors and officers liability coverage in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Transaction Expenses_ ").



Section 3.8 _Post Closing Adjustment_.



(a) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, a consolidated balance sheet of the Selling Companies and their
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") prepared
in accordance with GAAP using the Working Capital Accounting Principles and a
calculation based upon such Closing Balance Sheet setting forth in reasonable
detail the amount of Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Net Working Capital_ "). Within 60 days of the Closing Date,
Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Stockholders
Representative (i) the Closing Balance Sheet, together with worksheets and
data that support the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Net Working
Capital and (ii) a certificate of an executive officer of each of the
Surviving Companies certifying that the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Net Working Capital were prepared in  



 

29  accordance with Section 3.7(b) and this Section 3.8. Each of the Surviving
Companies shall give, and shall cause its advisers to give, the Stockholders
Representative and its advisers reasonable access to such books, records and
personnel of each of the Surviving Companies (including the work papers of
each of the Surviving Companies and their accountants relating to
the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Net Working
Capital) as may be necessary to enable the Stockholders Representative and
its advisers to review the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Net Working
Capital. The preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet shall be for the sole
purpose of determining the Closing Net Working Capital. The Stockholders
Representative shall have 30 days following its receipt of the Closing Balance
Sheet to review the same (the " _Closing Review Period_ "). On or before the
expiration of the Closing Review Period, the Stockholders Representative may
deliver to Parent a written statement (" _Stockholders  Representative
Notice_") accepting or objecting in good faith to the Closing Balance Sheet
and/or the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital (or any portion
thereof). In the event that the Stockholders Representative shall object to
the Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Closing Net Working Capital, the
Stockholders Representative Notice shall include a detailed itemization of
the Stockholders Representatives objections, the reasons therefor and a
revised calculation of the Net Working Capital based thereon. If the
Stockholders Representative does not deliver such Stockholders
Representative Notice to Parent within the Closing Review Period, the
Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the calculation
of the Closing Net Working Capital.



(b) In the event that the Stockholders Representative shall timely object to
the Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 3.8(a), Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall promptly meet and in good faith attempt to
resolve such objections. In the event that the Stockholders Representative
and Parent are not able to resolve such objections as may be raised with
respect to the Closing Net Working Capital, within the ten (10) day
period following the Closing Review Period, the matter shall be submitted to
BDO Seidman (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") immediately following the
expiration of such ten-day period for review and resolution, with instructions
to complete the same as promptly as practicable but in any event within 60
days of the expiration of such ten (10) day period. In making such
determination, the Accounting Referee may only consider those items and
amounts as to which Parent and the Stockholders Representative have
disagreed within the time period and on the terms specified above and must
resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement; _provided_ that the determination of the Accounting Referee will
neither be more favorable to Parent than the Closing Net Working Capital set
forth in the Closing Balance Sheet nor more favorable to the Stockholders
Representative than the revised Net Working Capital set forth in
the Stockholders Representative Notice. Such Accounting Referee shall
deliver a written report setting forth the resolution of each disputed item
and the calculation of the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "
_Final Net Working Capital_ ") as determined in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement as soon as practicable following the submission of the matter
to such firm but in any event within the 60 day period referred to above,
which calculation, absent manifest error, shall be binding and conclusive on
the parties and not subject to appeal and may be enforced in any court having
jurisdiction. The fees and costs of the Accounting Referee, if one is
required, shall be borne proportionally by (i) the Stockholders on one hand
and (ii) Parent and Fluent (on a pro rata basis based on the Holding Working
Capital Escrow Amount and the Fluent Working Capital Escrow Amount,
respectively) on the other  



 

30  hand, on the basis, for each such party, of the ratio of (A) the difference
between the amount of Net Working Capital submitted by each of Parent and the
Stockholders Representative to the Accounting Referee and the Final Net
Working Capital determined by the Accounting Referee to (B) the difference
between the Net Working Capital amounts submitted by each of Parent and
the Stockholders Representative to the Accounting Referee. In the event that
the Stockholders are obligated to pay any amounts pursuant to the immediately
foregoing sentence, such amounts shall be deducted from the Working Capital
Escrow Amounts on a pro rata basis based on the Holding Working Capital
Escrow Amount and the Fluent Working Capital Escrow Amount.



(c) Within two (2) Business Days following the determination of the Final Net
Working Capital as calculated in accordance with Section 3.8(b) or the deemed
acceptance of the Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with Section
3.8(a) (for the purpose of this Section 3.8(c), the Final Net Working
Capital), Parent shall deliver to the Stockholders Representative a notice
(the " _Parent Payment Notice_ ") setting forth (i) the amount of the Final
Net Working Capital; and (ii) the difference between the amount of the Final
Net Working Capital and the Base Net Working Capital (" _Final Amount_ "). To
the extent that the Final Net Working Capital is greater than the Base Net
Working Capital, Parent and Fluent shall each pay to the Working Capital
Escrow Agent an amount equal to such entitys pro rata share (based on the
Holding Working Capital Escrow Amount and the Fluent Working Capital Escrow
Amount) of the Final Amount, after making appropriate adjustment to reflect
any payments previously made or benefits received at the Closing pursuant to
Section 3.7(a)(ii) (" _Net Working Capital Overage_ ") for inclusion in the
Holding Working Capital Escrow Amount and the Fluent Working Capital Escrow
Amount, respectively. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
no entity that owns, directly or indirectly, any interest in Fluent shall be
liable for the obligation of Fluent in the immediately preceding sentence. To
the extent the Base Net Working Capital is greater than the Final Net
Working Capital, the Working Capital Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent and
Fluent, from the Holding Working Capital Escrow Amount and the Fluent Working
Capital Escrow Amount, respectively, such entitys pro rata share (based on
the Holding Working Capital Escrow Amount and the Fluent Working Capital
Escrow Amount) of the Final Amount, after making appropriate adjustment to
reflect any payments previously made or benefits received at the Closing
pursuant to Section 3.7(a)(ii) (" _Net Working Capital Shortfall_ "). To the
extent the Final Net Working Capital is the same as the amount of the Base Net
Working Capital, no payments shall be made except that if the Adjusted Cash
Consideration was adjusted at Closing pursuant to Section 3.7(a)(ii) and (A)
the Stockholders received the benefit of such adjustment, the Working Capital
Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent and Fluent an amount equal to such entities
respective shares (on a pro rata basis based on the Holding Working Capital
Escrow Amount and the Fluent Working Capital Escrow Amount) of the benefit
amount paid at Closing from the Holding Working Capital Escrow Amount and the
Fluent Working Capital Escrow Amount, or (B) Parent and Fluent received the
benefit of such adjustment, Parent and Fluent shall pay to the Working Capital
Escrow Agent an amount equal to each entitys benefit amount received at
Closing for inclusion in the Holding Working Capital Escrow Amount and the
Fluent Working Capital Escrow Amount. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, no entity that owns, directly or indirectly, any interest in
Fluent shall be liable for the obligation of Fluent in the
immediately preceding sentence. Any payment made pursuant to this Section
3.8(c) shall be made via wire transfer of immediately available funds within
one (1) Business Day of the date of Parent Payment Notice.



 

31 Section 3.9 _Working Capital Escrows_.



(a) At the Fourth Effective Time, Parent shall deduct from the cash portion
of the First Merger Consideration and the cash portion of the Third Merger
Consideration and pay to an escrow agent selected by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Selling Companies (the " _Working Capital Escrow Agent_ ")
an amount in cash equal to $3,000,000 _minus_ the Fluent Working Capital
Escrow Amount (the " _Holding Working Capital Escrow Amount_ ") and Fluent
shall deduct from the cash portion of the Fourth Merger Consideration and pay
to the Working Capital Escrow Agent an amount in cash equal to $3,000,000
multiplied by the percentage of the Adjusted Cash Consideration to be received
by the Fluent Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Fluent Working
Capital Escrow Amount_ " and, collectively with the Holding Working Capital
Escrow Amount, the " _Working Capital Escrow Amounts_ "). The Working Capital
Escrow Amounts will be held by the Working Capital Escrow Agent pending
calculation of the Final Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 3.8 and the
payment or receipt, if any, of the Net Working Capital Shortfall or Net
Working Capital Overage, as applicable, pursuant to Section 3.8(c).



(b) The Holding Working Capital Escrow Amount remaining after any payment or
receipt of Net Working Capital Shortfall or Net Working Capital Overage, as
applicable, in accordance with Section 3.8(c) shall be paid by the Working
Capital Escrow Agent to the Holding Master Escrow, and, to the
extent released from the Holding Master Escrow, by the Master Escrow Agent to
the Exchange Agent (or to the Second Surviving Company and the Third Surviving
Corporation if the Exchange Agent has distributed all remaining funds in
accordance with Section 4.1(i)) and then by the Exchange Agent (or the Second
Surviving Company and the Third Surviving Corporation if they have succeeded
to the obligations of the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 4.1(i)) to the
Holding Stockholders and the Company Stockholders who have executed the
contribution agreement referred to in Section 11.3(i) based on each such
Stockholders pro rata amount of the cash portion of the First Merger
Consideration and the Third Merger Consideration as set forth in the Schedule
provided by the Selling Companies at the Closing (each amount, the " _Holding
Stockholder s Pro Rata Cash Amount_"), and the Fluent Working Capital Escrow
Amount remaining after any payment or receipt of Net Working Capital
Shortfall or Net Working Capital Overage, as applicable, in accordance with
Section 3.8(c) shall be paid by the Working Capital Escrow Agent to the Fluent
Master Escrow, and, to the extent released from the Fluent Master Escrow, by
the Master Escrow Agent to the Exchange Agent (or to the Fourth Surviving
Corporation if the Exchange Agent has distributed all remaining funds in
accordance with Section 4.1(i)) and then by the Exchange Agent (or the
Fourth Surviving Corporation if it has succeeded to the obligations of the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 4.1(i)) to the Fluent Stockholders who have
executed the contribution agreement referred to in Section 11.3(i) based on
such Stockholders pro rata amount of the cash portion of the Fourth Merger
Consideration set forth in the Schedule provided by the Selling Companies at
the Closing (each amount, the " _Fluent Stockholder s Pro Rata
Cash Amount_"). Pending such payments, the Working Capital Escrow Agent shall
invest the Working Capital Escrow Amounts in short term obligations of, or
obligations fully guaranteed by, the United States of America, or any agency
of the United States of America. Until distributed by the Working Capital
Escrow Agent, all amounts included in the Holding Working Capital Escrow
Amount shall be the property of the Holding Stockholders and the Company
Stockholders and  



 

32  any interest accrued thereon shall be included in the Holding Working
Capital Escrow Amount and distributed in accordance with Section 3.8(c) or
this Section 3.9(b), as applicable, and all amounts included in the Fluent
Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be the property of the Fluent Stockholders
and any interest accrued thereon shall be included in the Fluent Working
Capital Escrow Amount and distributed in accordance with Section 3.8(c) or
this Section 3.9(b), as applicable. Parent and the Stockholders
Representative agree to cooperate to the extent necessary to deliver
instructions to the Working Capital Escrow Agent to release any undisputed
amounts from the Holding Working Capital Escrow Amount as soon as practicable
following any mutual determination that such amounts are undisputed, and
Fluent and the Stockholders Representative agree to cooperate to the extent
necessary to deliver instructions to the Working Capital Escrow Agent to
release any undisputed amounts from the Fluent Working Capital Escrow Amount
as soon as practicable following any mutual determination that such
amounts are undisputed.



Section 3.10 _Vesting of Incentive Stock_. Parent and Merger Subs acknowledge
that all shares of Incentive Stock that are unvested immediately prior to the
Fourth Effective Time shall immediately vest and the restrictions expiring
upon vesting associated therewith shall automatically be deemed waived as
provided by the Company Incentive Plan.



Section 3.11 _No Stock Option Plans_. The Surviving Companies acknowledge that
there are no outstanding options to purchase any Selling Companies Stock and
that none of the Selling Companies has any plan, program or practice that
provides for the issuance or purchase of any equity of the Selling Companies,
other than the Warrants, the Holding Preferred Stock, the Company Preferred
Stock and the Company Incentive Plan.



_ARTICLE IV - PAYMENT FOR SHARES; DISSENTING SHARES_

 



Section 4.1 _Payment for Shares of Stock of the Selling Companies_.



(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any
event not less than 20 days before the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a
national bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Selling Companies
to act as Exchange Agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments provided for in
Section 4.1(c) out of any deposits made with the Exchange Agent from the
Holding Master Escrow and the Fluent Master Escrow, and such deposits shall
not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.



(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Fourth Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Companies to, cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each record holder of an outstanding Certificate or
Certificates that immediately prior to the applicable Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Selling Companies Stock (i) a form of letter
of transmittal reasonably acceptable to Parent (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration relating thereto, with
respect to each share formerly represented by such Certificate; _provided_
that Parent shall assist the Selling Companies  



 

33  in developing arrangements for the delivery of such materials prior to
Closing to all Persons entitled to receive Merger Consideration and to
facilitate the delivery of the payments pursuant to Section 3.2(c) and (d) to
certain significant Holding Stockholders (by wire transfer in the case of
cash) as soon as practicable following the Fourth Effective Time; _provided_
that such Holding Stockholders shall have first complied with the
requirements set forth in Section 11.3(i).



(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive in respect of the shares formerly represented by such
Certificate, _provided_ that such portion of the Merger Consideration has been
released from the Holding Master Escrow and the Fluent Master Escrow. Any
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any of the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Certificates, except to the extent interest is included in the amounts
released from the Holding Master Escrow and the Fluent Master Escrow.



(d) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer and delivered to the Exchange Agent with all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Companies that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 4.1(d), each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing shares of Selling Companies Stock to be canceled in
accordance with Sections 3.2(b), 3.3(b), 3.4(b) and 3.5(b) and Dissenting
Shares) shall at any time after the applicable Effective Time represent solely
the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, as
applicable, as contemplated by this Section 4.1.



(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
and the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent
or the Surviving Companies may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate to be lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares formerly represented thereby.



(f) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Parent, Merger Subs,
Merger Sub III, the Selling Companies, the Surviving Companies or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration from the deposits described in Section 4.1(a) properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately
prior to the date on which any shares of Selling Companies Stock would
otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Authority,
any such shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Companies, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.



 

34 (g) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Companies shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the applicable Merger Consideration or
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares
such amounts as are required to be withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of United States federal, state or local tax Laws and shall instead
pay such amount to the applicable Tax Authority. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Companies,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent, Parent or
the Surviving Companies.



(h) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in
accordance with the terms of this Section 4.1 shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares formerly
represented by such Certificate. At the applicable Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of each of the Selling Companies shall be closed and no further
registration of transfers of shares shall thereafter be made on the records of
the Selling Companies. If, after the applicable Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Companies for transfer, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration relating thereto, as provided in
this Section 4.1, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.



(i) Promptly following the date that is six (6) months after the Fourth
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver (i) to Parent all cash,
shares of Parent Common Stock, Certificates and other documents in its
possession relating to the First Merger, the Second Merger or the Third
Merger and (ii) to Fluent, all cash, shares of Parent Common Stock,
Certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the Fourth
Merger, and the Exchange Agents duties shall then terminate. Any former
Stockholders who have not complied with Section 4.1 prior to the end of such
six (6) month period shall thereafter look only to Parent or Fluent, as
appropriate, (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration relating thereto,
without any interest thereon.



Section 4.2 _Appraisal Rights_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
the Selling Companies Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the applicable Effective Time and that are held by Stockholders who, in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights Provisions_
") (i) have not consented in the respective Stockholder Written Consent to
adopt and approve this Agreement, (ii) shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such shares, and (iii) have not effectively withdrawn, lost or
failed to perfect their rights to appraisal (collectively, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), will not be converted as described in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and
3.5, as applicable, but at the applicable Effective Time, by virtue of the
applicable Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to
receive only those rights provided under the Appraisal Rights Provisions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all shares of Selling Companies Stock held
by Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares of Selling
Companies Stock under  



 

35  the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall thereupon be deemed to have been
canceled and to have been converted, as of the applicable Effective Time, into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration relating thereto, without
interest, in the manner provided in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5 as
applicable. Persons who have perfected statutory rights with respect to
Dissenting Shares (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") as aforesaid will not
be paid as provided in this Agreement and will have only such rights as are
provided by the Appraisal Rights Provisions with respect to such Dissenting
Shares.



(b) The Selling Companies shall give Parent and Merger Subs prompt notice of
any demands received by the Selling Companies for the exercise of appraisal
rights with respect to shares of Selling Companies Stock and Parent shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. None of the Selling Companies shall, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands.



(c) Each Dissenting Stockholder who becomes entitled under the Appraisal
Rights Provisions to payment for Dissenting Shares of Holdings or the Company
shall receive payment therefor after the Fourth Effective Time from the Second
Surviving Company or the Third Surviving Corporation, as appropriate (but only
after the amount thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally determined
pursuant to the Appraisal Rights Provisions), and such shares of Holding Stock
and/or Company Stock shall be canceled. Each Dissenting Stockholder who
becomes entitled under the Appraisal Rights Provisions to payment for
Dissenting Shares of Fluent shall receive payment therefor after the Fourth
Effective Time from the Fourth Surviving Corporation (but only after the
amount thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to
the Appraisal Rights Provisions), and such shares of Fluent Stock shall be
canceled.



_ARTICLE V - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLING COMPANIES_

under the laws of each jurisdiction listed on _Section 5.1(a)_ of the Selling
Companies Disclosure Schedule and each other jurisdiction in which the
character of its properties or in which the transaction of its business makes

or approve any new Plan or Employment Agreement. Each of the Employee Benefit
Plans and Employment Agreements is in full force and effect and none of the
Selling Companies or any of their Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the
Selling Companies, any other party thereto is in material default or breach
under the terms of any such Employee Benefit Plan or Employment Agreement.
Each of the Employee Benefit Plans and Employment Agreements is a valid and
binding obligation of the applicable Selling Company and/or its Subsidiaries
and, to the Knowledge of the Selling Companies, each of the other
parties, enforceable against them in accordance with its terms. The
applicable Selling Company and/or its Subsidiaries has duly performed all of
its material obligations under each such Employee Benefit Plan and Employment
Agreement to the extent that such obligations have accrued.



(b) With respect to each Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Qualified Plans_ "), the
IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each Qualified
Plan and the related trust that has not been revoked, and there are no
existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would  



 

50  reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
Qualified Plan or the related trust. All contributions, premiums and benefit
payments under or in connection with the Qualified Plans that are required to

timely made.



 

(c) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the Selling Companies and
their Subsidiaries have complied, and are now in compliance, in all material
respects, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all Laws and Regulations
applicable to such Employee Benefit Plans. Each Plan has been administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms. Except as set forth in 
_Section 5.14(c)_ of the Selling Companies Disclosure Schedule, each Employee
Benefit Plan specifically provides that it may be amended or terminated at any
time without any liability to any of the Selling Companies (other than
with respect to accrued benefits), any of their Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates and no representation to the contrary has been
made. There is not now, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably
be expected to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with
respect to a Plan or the imposition of any Lien on the assets of the Selling
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates under ERISA or the Code or any other Laws. None of the Selling
Companies, their Subsidiaries, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, or
any other Person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of
ERISA), which would reasonably likely be subject any of the Employee Benefit
Plans or their related trusts, any of the Selling Companies, any of their
Subsidiaries, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates or any Person that
any of the Selling Companies, any of their Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has an obligation to indemnify, to any tax or
penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. Each
Employee Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section
3(1) of ERISA (a " _Welfare Plan_ ") either (i) is funded through an insurance
company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning
of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) is unfunded. No Welfare Plan is self-
insured or self-funded (except for a flexible health spending account), or
subject to regulation under Section 419 or 419A under the Code, or maintains a
trust. 



(d) (i) no Employee Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has
two (2) or more contributing sponsors at least two (2) of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple
Employer Plan_ "); (ii) none of the Selling Companies and their Subsidiaries
or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has ever contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan, a Multiple Employer Plan or
an employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA; and (iii) none of the
Selling Companies and their Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliates has incurred
any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full.



(e) No Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or
4971 of the Code. There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist
that would reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability
that would be a liability of the Selling Companies, any of
their Subsidiaries, or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates (including
the Surviving Companies and their ERISA Affiliates) following the Closing.
Except as set forth in _Section 5.14(e)_ of the Selling Companies Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Selling Companies or any of their Subsidiaries has any
liability for life, health, medical or other welfare  



 

51  benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof
including retiree medical, health or life benefits, except for health
continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA or state health continuation law and at no expense to the
Selling Companies and their Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on _Section
5.14(e)_ of the Selling Companies Disclosure Schedule, the Selling Companies
and each of their Subsidiaries has reserved the right to amend, terminate or
modify at any time all plans or arrangements providing for retiree health or
life insurance coverage. 



(f) Except as set forth on  _Section 5.14(f)_ of the Selling Companies
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or
in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated
vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of any of the Selling
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates, or result in any limitation on the right of any of the Selling
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Employee Benefit Plan or related trust or any
Material Employment Agreement or related trust. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount required to be paid to or with respect
to any employee or other service provider of any of the Selling Companies or
any of their Subsidiaries (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of
benefits) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) could be an "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code.



(g) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Selling Companies,
threatened Actions (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course),
which have been asserted or instituted (i) against any of the Selling
Companies pursuant to any Employment Agreement or in connection or as a result
of the termination thereof, or (ii) against any Employee Benefit Plan, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to any Employee Benefit Plan
or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Plans, in each case which
would reasonably be expected to result in any liability of any of the Selling
Companies, any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Department of
Treasury, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Plan, any
participant in a Plan, or any other party, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Selling Companies
Material Adverse Effect. Each individual who renders services to any of the
Selling Companies, any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates who is classified by such Selling Company or such Subsidiary,
as applicable, as having the status of an independent contractor or other
non-employee status for any purpose (including for purposes of taxation and
tax reporting and under Employee Benefit Plans) is properly so characterized,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Selling Companies Material Adverse Effect.



(h) Each Employee Benefit Plan which is a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan is in "good faith compliance" in all material respects, in both form and
operation, with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance thereunder. No
payment to be made under any Employee Benefit Plan is, or to the Knowledge of
the Selling Companies will be, subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1)
of the Code.



 

52 (i) For purposes of this Section 5.14, references to the "Selling Companies"
or their "Subsidiaries" shall include and incorporate each of their respective
ERISA Affiliates.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other party or parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all of the conditions precedent that

approvals and to make filings from or with any Governmental Authority or other
third party necessary for their execution and delivery of, and the performance

take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding
the receipt of any required approvals and shall promptly respond to any
requests for additional information from any Governmental Authority. Each of
Parent and Merger Subs hereby covenants and agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to secure termination of any waiting periods under the HSR Act or any
other applicable domestic or foreign Law set forth in _Schedule 9.5(b_ ) and
to obtain the approval of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental
Authority set forth in _Schedule 9.5(b)_ , as applicable, for the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall require Parent, in connection with the receipt of any
regulatory approval, to agree to sell, divest or license any assets or
business or agree to restrict any business conducted by or proposed to be
conducted by Parent, the Selling Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, or to
litigate or formally contest any proceedings relating to any regulatory
approval process in connection with the Mergers.



(c) Parent and each of the Selling Companies will (i) promptly notify the
other party of any written or oral communication to that party or its
Affiliates from any Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable Law
(including Regulations, codes, plans, Orders and charges thereunder),
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Authority, in each case concerning the
review, clearance or approval of any of the transactions contemplated hereby
under the HSR Act or any similar applicable foreign Laws; (ii) not agree to
participate, or to permit its Affiliates to participate, in any substantive
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the review, clearance or
approval of any of the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or
any similar applicable foreign Laws unless it consults with the other party in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives
the other party or its counsel the opportunity to attend and  



 

80  participate in such meeting; _provided_ that if the Governmental Authority
or applicable Law (including Regulations, codes, plans, Orders and
charges thereunder) does not permit such participation by the other party or
its counsel, or if Parent and Selling Companies counsel both agree in good
faith that participation of the Selling Companies or the Selling Companies
counsel would not be advisable, Parent meeting with such Governmental
Authority may proceed without the participation of Selling Companies or their
counsel; and (iii) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,
filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) drafted by or in conjunction with outside counsel between it and its
Affiliates and its respective representatives on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of such Governmental Authoritys staff on
the other hand, concerning the review, clearance or approval of any of the

foreign Law, except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law (including
Regulations, codes, plans, Orders and charges thereunder) or the instructions
of such Governmental Authority.

information required for any application or other filing under the rules and
regulations of any applicable law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

to obtain all of the consents of third parties listed in  _Schedule 9.5(e)_
(the " _Third Party Consents_ ") and each of Parent and Merger Subs shall
cooperate with any reasonable request of the Selling Companies in connection
with obtaining the Third Party Consents; _provided_ ,  _however_ , nothing in
this Section 9.5(e) shall require Parent to expend any amounts in connection
with obtaining any such Third Party Consents.



Section 9.6 _Registration of Shares_. Parent agrees to file with the SEC, as
early as possible following the Fourth Effective Time, but in any event
within one (1) Business Day, the Registration Statement covering the resale of
the Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Mergers (the " _Registrable
Securities_ "). Parent will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
maintain such effectiveness in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions
contained in the Registration Rights Agreement. To the extent Parents
Statement of Company Policy on Insider Trading and Disclosure applies to
any holders of Registrable Securities, such holders shall be subject to such
policy.



Section 9.7 _Director_. Immediately following the Fourth Effective Time,
Parent Board shall in accordance with provisions contained in Parents
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, take such action as necessary to (a)
increase the size of its Board by one (1) and (b) elect Dan Blumenthal or a
replacement named by the Stockholders Representative; _provided_ that such
nominee or and any named replacement shall meet the criteria provided in
Alaskas Corporate Governance Guidelines, as the same may be amended from time
to time (such nominee or replacement, the " _Holding Designee_ ") as a Class
III Director of Parent Board to hold office in accordance with Parent Charter
and its bylaws and until his successor is duly elected or qualified, or his
earlier death, resignation or removal. Each of the Holding Designee and the
Principal Stockholders will be subject to Parents Statement of Company
Policy on Insider Trading and Disclosure and Insider Trading Procedures and
each shall execute an acknowledgement to such effect upon the election of the
Holding Designee to Parent Board. In addition, such director shall  



 

81  acknowledge Parents Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. For so long as the
holders of Fluent Stock and Holding Stock immediately prior to the
First Effective Time continue to hold at least five percent (5%) of the
issued and outstanding shares of the Parent Common Stock, Parent agrees to
nominate the Holding Designee as a Class III Director to serve on Parents
board and use commercially reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from
Parents stockholders to elect the Holding Designee as a director of Parent.



Section 9.8 _Press Releases_. Prior to the First Effective Time, the parties
hereto will, and will cause each of their Affiliates and representatives to,
consult with and obtain the approval of (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) the other party before issuing any press release or
other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no party hereto shall issue or cause to
be issued any such press release prior to such consultation and approval;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the
other parties hereto, issue or cause publication of any such press release or
public announcement to the extent that such party reasonably determines, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, such action to be required by Law or
by the rules of any applicable self-regulatory organization, in which event
such party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow the other
parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such press release or public
announcement in advance of its issuance. Upon the execution of this Agreement
and at the Closing, Parent and the Selling Companies shall issue a mutually
agreed upon press release announcing the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 9.9 N _o Solicitations_.



(a) Until the earlier of the Fourth Effective Time and the date of termination
of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.1, none of the
Selling Companies or any of their Subsidiaries shall take nor shall the
Selling Companies permit any of the Selling Companies or their Subsidiaries
directors, officers, employees, advisors, representatives or agents to take
(directly or indirectly) any of the following actions with any Person other
than Parent and its designees: (i) solicit, entertain, initiate, facilitate or
encourage any proposal or offer from, or participate or engage in or conduct
any discussions or negotiations with, any Person relating to any inquiry,
contact, offer or proposal, oral, written or otherwise, formal or informal,
with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal for the Selling Companies
or any of their Subsidiaries (whether such Subsidiary is in existence on the
date hereof or is hereafter organized), (ii) provide any information with
respect to the Selling Companies or any of their Subsidiaries (whether
such Subsidiary is in existence on the date hereof or is hereafter organized)
to any Person other than Parent, relating to (or which the Selling Companies
believes would be used for the purpose of formulating) an offer or proposal
with respect to, or otherwise assist, cooperate with, facilitate or encourage
any effort or attempt by any such Person with regard to, any possible
Acquisition Proposal for any of the Selling Companies or any of their
Subsidiaries (whether such Subsidiary is in existence on the date hereof or
is hereafter organized), (iii) approve or agree to or enter into a Contract
with any Person other than Parent providing for an Acquisition Proposal for
the Selling Companies or any of their Subsidiaries (whether such Subsidiary
is in existence on the date hereof or is hereafter organized), (iv) make or
authorize any statement, recommendation, solicitation or endorsement in
support of any possible Acquisition Proposal for the Selling Companies or any
of their Subsidiaries (whether such Subsidiary is in existence on the date
hereof or is hereafter organized) other than the acquisition  



 

82  proposal from Parent contemplated by this Agreement, or (v) authorize or
permit any of the Selling Companies directors, officers,
employees, advisors, representatives or agents to take any such action;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, at any time prior to the approval and adoption
of this Agreement by the Stockholders, if the Selling Companies receive a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 9.9, the Selling Companies may
furnish non-public information with respect to the Selling Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal and
may participate in discussions regarding such Acquisition Proposal if (A) the
Selling Companies Boards determine in good faith, after receiving advice from
their outside counsel, that failure to do so would violate their fiduciary
duties to the Stockholders under applicable Law, and (B) the Selling Companies
Boards determine that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.



(b) The Selling Companies shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any such Contacts or negotiations with any Person relating to any such
transaction or Acquisition Proposal. In addition to the foregoing, if (after
this Agreement is executed and delivered by the Selling Companies and prior to
the First Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 13.1) the Selling Companies receive any offer or
proposal (formal or informal, oral, written or otherwise) relating to, or any
inquiry or contact from any Person with respect to, an Acquisition Proposal,
the Selling Companies shall immediately notify Parent thereof and provide
Parent with the details thereof, including the identity of the Person or
Persons making such offer, proposal, inquiry or contact and shall keep Parent
fully informed on a current basis of the status and details of any such offer
or proposal and of any modifications to the terms thereof.



(c) Each of the Selling Companies and Parent acknowledge that this Section 9.9
was a significant inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement and the
absence of such a provision would have resulted in either (i) a material
reduction in the consideration to be paid to the Stockholders in the Mergers
or (ii) the failure to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement.



Section 9.10  _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_.



(a) Subject to applicable Laws, Parent and Merger Subs agree that all rights
to indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on
the personal liability of, each present and former director, officer,
employee, fiduciary and agent of any of the Selling Companies and their
Subsidiaries on or prior to the First Effective Time provided for in the
respective charters or by-laws of the Selling Companies and their Subsidiaries
or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall continue in full force and
effect in all material respects for a period of six (6) years from the Fourth
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any claims asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no right
to indemnification or exculpation shall exist with respect to any liabilities
of a stockholder of any of the Selling Companies in their capacity as a
stockholder regarding any claim related to or in connection with any breach of
the representations and warranties contained in Article V hereof, in the
Selling Companies Disclosure Schedule or in the Ancillary Agreements.



 

83 (b) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Selling Companies shall purchase an
extended reporting period endorsement under each of the Selling Companies
existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the Selling

Surviving Companies to, maintain such policy in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

Time, the employees of the Surviving Companies and their Subsidiaries who

Employees_ ") will be entitled to participate in either (a) the Employee
Benefit Plans (other than equity-based plans) on the same terms, or terms
which in the aggregate provide substantially comparable benefits, as those in
effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time, (b) the employee benefit
plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries on the same terms as similarly-
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries or (c) a combination of (a)
and (b), and in each case in the discretion of Parent, and Parent may
terminate any of the Employee Benefit Plans or merge any of the Employee
Benefit Plans with Parents employee benefit plans as Parent deems
appropriate. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law and unless such
recognition of service would result in a duplication of benefits, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Companies to, treat, and cause the
applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of Selling Companies Employees
with the Selling Companies or their Subsidiaries attributable to any period
before the First Effective Time as service rendered to Parent or
the Surviving Companies for all purposes, including but not limited to,
eligibility to participate, vesting and for other appropriate benefit
accruals, including, but not limited to, applicability of any minimum waiting
periods for participation, excluding for these purposes benefit accrued under
any defined benefit plan. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall not,
and shall cause the Surviving Companies not to, treat any Selling Companies

a Plan of a Selling Company immediately before the First Effective Time.

of any Selling Companies audit or review work papers, including the

releasing all rights or claims that such holder might have or assert in

of Incorporation to (i) consent to receive upon the consummation of the First
Merger either the liquidation value (as defined in the Holding Certificate of

_ARTICLE XI - SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS
AND AGREEMENTS OF THE SELLING COMPANIES; ESCROW PROVISIONS; INDEMNIFICATION_



Section 11.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements of the Selling Companies_. Subject to the limitations and other
provisions of this Agreement, the representations, warranties, agreements,
covenants and obligations of Selling Companies herein, in the Selling
Companies Disclosure Schedule or in the Ancillary Agreements shall survive the
Closing regardless of any investigation on the part of Parent or any of
its representatives and shall remain in full force and effect until 11:59
p.m. New York City time on the day which is one (1) year from the Closing Date
(such actual termination date shall be referred to herein as the "
_Indemnification Cut-Off Date_ "); _provided_ that, such period shall not
apply to the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.2,
5.13, 5.20 and 5.29 (collectively, the " _Excluded Representations and
Warranties_ ") and such Excluded Representations and Warranties shall, in the
case of Sections 5.1 and 5.2, survive forever and, in the case of Sections
5.13, 5.20 and 5.29 survive until the 30th day after the expiration of the
statute of limitations with respect thereto; and _provided_ _further_ that any
claim that has been duly submitted by a Parent Indemnified Party for recourse
or indemnification hereunder prior to the applicable expiration date and that
has not been completely and finally resolved prior to such expiration date
shall survive until such time as such claim is resolved, completely and
finally, _provided_ that such claim by a Parent Indemnified Party shall (i)
specify the applicable provision of this Agreement under which the claim is
brought, (ii) set out in reasonable detail the specific basis for the claim,
and (iii) identify the amount of damages sought.



Section 11.2 _Indemnification_.



(a) Each of the Stockholders agree, subject to the provisions and limitations
set forth in this Article XI, to severally, with respect to their pro rata
amount of the Merger Consideration, and not jointly, indemnify Parent, the
Surviving Companies, their respective  



 

91  Subsidiaries, successors and assignees and their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, agents and Affiliates (other than any
officer, director, employee or stockholder of the Selling Companies
immediately prior to the applicable Effective Time) (each a " _Parent
Indemnified Party_ " and collectively the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ")
against and hold them harmless to the extent of any Losses (other than Losses
attributable to Taxes, for which Article XII shall be the exclusive remedy),
as the same are incurred, of any kind or nature whatsoever, which may be
sustained or suffered by any such Parent Indemnified Party based upon,
arising out of, or by reason of (i) any breach or violation of, inaccuracy in
or omission from any representation or warranty, other than any representation
or warranty contained in Section 5.13, when made or deemed made as of the
Closing Date of the Selling Companies contained in this Agreement, the Selling
Companies Disclosure Schedules, any of the Ancillary Agreements or any
certificate, agreement or instrument delivered in connection herewith or
therewith or any claim by any third party alleging, constituting or involving
such a breach, violation, inaccuracy or omission, (ii) any breach or violation
of any covenant or agreement of the Selling Companies contained in this
Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate, agreement or
instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith or any claim by any
third party alleging, constituting or involving such a breach or violation,
(iii) the Other Business, the Other Business Transfer, the Other Business
Liabilities, or any other Liabilities or matters relating to the Spin-Off or
the Spin-Off Entities, or (iv) any deficit in the Working Capital Escrow
Amounts. In addition, each of the Stockholders agrees, subject to the
provisions and limitations set forth in this Article XI, to severally, and not
jointly, indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties against and hold them
harmless to the extent of any Losses, as the same are incurred, of any
kind or nature whatsoever, which may be sustained or suffered by any such
Parent Indemnified Party based upon, arising out of, or by reason of acts of
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach by such Stockholder.



(b) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any
indemnification for any amount of indemnifiable Losses in excess of the
Indemnification Escrow Funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Principal
Stockholders on their own behalf and on behalf of their successors, executors,
administrators, estate, heirs and assigns (collectively, the " _Principal
Stockholder Indemnifying Parties_ ," and each individually, a " _Principal
Stockholder Indemnifying Party_ ") agree, subject to the provisions and
limitations set forth in this Article XI, severally, with respect to their
pro rata amount of the Merger Consideration, and not jointly, to indemnify and
hold the Parent Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all
Losses (other than Losses attributable to Taxes, for which Article XII shall
be the exclusive remedy), which may be sustained or suffered by any such
Parent Indemnified Party based upon, arising out of, or by reason of (i) a
breach by the Selling Companies of any of the Excluded Representations or
Warranties, other than a breach of Section 5.13, (ii) a breach by the Selling
Companies of Section 5.7(d), (iii) the Other Business, the Other Business
Transfer, the Other Business Liabilities, or any other Liabilities or matters
relating to the Spin-Off or the Spin-Off Entities, (iv) any deficit in the
Working Capital Escrow Amounts, or (v) acts of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach by such Principal
Stockholder Indemnifying Party. Each of the Stockholders agrees severally,
with respect to their pro rata amount of the Merger Consideration, and not
jointly, to contribute to any amounts paid by the Principal Stockholders
pursuant to this Section 11.2(b) in accordance with the terms of the Holding
Master Escrow, the Fluent Master Escrow and, as applicable, the contribution
agreement referred to in  



 

92  Section 11.3(i). The Parent Indemnified Parties indemnification rights
pursuant to this Section 11.2(b) and Article XII in the aggregate shall be
limited to the amount of proceeds received by the Principal Stockholder
Indemnifying Parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, if a Principal Stockholder
Indemnifying Party sells or otherwise transfers any Parent Common Stock
received in the Mergers, the proceeds received by such Principal Stockholder
Indemnifying Party shall mean the cash proceeds received by such Principal
Stockholder Indemnifying Party in connection with such sale (net of any
commissions).



(c) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall first seek recovery for any
indemnifiable Losses from the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance with
the provisions of Section 11.3; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to Losses which may be sustained or suffered by
any such Parent Indemnified Party as set forth in Section 11.2(b), the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall prior to the Indemnification Cut-Off Date first seek
recovery for up to $5,000,000 of any indemnifiable Losses from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.3
and thereafter may seek indemnification, without regard to the Indemnification
Escrow Funds, from the Principal Stockholder Indemnifying Parties.



(d) The amount of any indemnifiable Loss shall be calculated net of any
insurance proceeds received by the Parent Indemnified Party on account of such
Loss. In the event that an insurance recovery is received by any Parent
Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery shall be either (i) made promptly to the Indemnification Escrow Funds
or distributed in accordance with Section 11.3(d), as applicable, if such
Loss was paid from the Indemnification Escrow Funds or (ii) delivered to the
Principal Stockholder Indemnifying Parties if such Loss was paid by the
Principal Stockholder Indemnifying Parties. To the extent that a Parent
Indemnified Party recognizes a Tax benefit with respect to a Loss that is the
subject of an indemnification payment pursuant to this Article XI, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to such Tax benefit and the
Parent Indemnified Party shall pay to the Master Escrow Agent for the benefit
of the indemnifying party the amount of such Tax benefit (but not in excess of
the indemnification payment or payments actually received with respect to such
Loss) at such time or times as and to the extent that the Parent Indemnified
Party actually realizes such benefit through a refund of Tax or reduction in
the actual amount of Taxes which such Parent Indemnified Party would otherwise
have had to pay if such Loss had not been incurred, calculated by computing
the amount of Taxes before and after inclusion of any Tax items attributable
to such Loss for which indemnification was made and treating such Tax items as
the last items claimed for any taxable year;  _provided_ that any such Tax
benefit shall be reduced by the amount of Tax detriment (including the tax
effect of any item of income or gain or other item (including any decrease in
Tax basis) which increases any amounts paid or payable with respect to Taxes,
any reduction in the amount of any refund of Tax which would otherwise have
been available, the utilization of any net operating loss or capital loss or
the utilization of any Tax credits or other Tax attributes) that the
Parent Indemnified Party suffered as a result of any indemnification payment
pursuant to this Article XI.



 

93 Section 11.3 _Escrow Provisions_.



(a) _Establishment of the Indemnification Escrow Funds_. Immediately after
the Third Effective Time, without any act of any Person who was a holder of
Selling Companies Stock immediately prior to the applicable Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be delivered to an escrow agent selected by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Selling Companies (the " _Indemnification Escrow
Agent_ ") (i) an amount of cash equal to $10,000,000 _less_ the Fluent Cash
Escrow Amount provided below (the " _Holding Cash Escrow Amount_ ") and (ii)
that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock Escrow Amount_ ")
having a value equal to $20,000,000 based on the average closing price of
Parent Common Stock for the ten (10) days prior to, and not including, the
Closing Date (the " _Closing Price_ "). Immediately after the Fourth Effective
Time, without any act of any Person who was a holder of Selling Companies
Stock immediately prior to the applicable Effective Time, Fluent shall cause
to be delivered to the Indemnification Escrow Agent an amount of cash equal to
$10,000,000 _multiplied by_ the percentage of the Adjusted Cash Consideration
to be received by the Fluent Stockholders pursuant to Section 3.5 of this
Agreement (the " _Fluent Cash Escrow Amount_ "). The Holding Cash Escrow
Amount, the Fluent Cash Escrow Amount and the Stock Escrow Amount shall
constitute the Indemnification Escrow Funds (the " _Indemnification Escrow
Funds_ "). The Indemnification Escrow Funds shall be governed by the terms set
forth in this Article XI. The portion of the Holding Cash Escrow Amount and
the Stock Escrow Amount contributed in respect of each Stockholder shall
equal such Stockholders Holding Stockholders Pro Rata Cash Amount or
Stockholders Pro Rata Stock Amount, respectively, and the portion of the
Fluent Cash Escrow Amount contributed in respect of each Fluent Stockholder
shall equal such Fluent Stockholders Cash Pro Rata Amount. Any payments from
the cash held in the Indemnification Escrow Funds (whether to Parent, for
expenses, or otherwise) shall be allocated on a pro rata basis based on
the Holding Cash Escrow Amount and the Fluent Cash Escrow Amount.



(b) _Recourse to the Indemnification Escrow Funds_. The Indemnification Escrow
Funds shall be available to compensate the Parent Indemnified Parties for any
and all Losses paid, incurred, sustained or accrued by Parent or any other
Parent Indemnified Party arising from, relating to or resulting from (i) any
breach or violation of, inaccuracy in or omission from any representation or
warranty, when made or deemed made as of the Closing Date of the Selling
Companies contained in this Agreement, the Selling Companies Disclosure
Schedules, any of the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate, agreement or
instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith or any claim by any
third party alleging, constituting or involving such a breach, violation,
inaccuracy or omission, (ii) any breach or violation of any covenant or
agreement of the Selling Companies contained in this Agreement, any of the
Ancillary Agreements or any certificate, agreement or instrument delivered in
connection herewith or therewith or any claim by any third party alleging,
constituting or involving such a breach or violation, (iii) the Other
Business, the Other Business Transfer, the Other Business Liabilities, or any
other Liabilities or matters relating to the Spin-Off or the Spin-Off
Entities, (iv) any deficit in the Working Capital Escrow Amounts, (v) the Tax
Indemnification pursuant to Section 12.1 or (vi) acts of fraud, intentional
misrepresentations or willful breach.



 

94 (c) _Limitation to Recourse_.



(i) Parent Indemnified Party may not make any claims against the
Indemnification Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 11.3(b) above (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any claim arising under Article XII) unless and until
the aggregate Losses paid, incurred, sustained or accrued (or anticipated to
be paid, incurred, sustained or accrued) equal or exceed $1,000,000 (the "
_Deductible Amount_ "), and then only such Losses that exceed the Deductible
Amount shall be recoverable by the Parent Indemnified Parties in accordance
with the terms hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall not be subject to any limitations pursuant to this Section
11.3(c) or otherwise, including, without limitation, such Deductible Amount,
in respect of claims and shall be entitled to recover from the first dollar
from the Indemnification Escrow Funds for Losses in connection with (i) a
breach by the Selling Companies of any of the Excluded Representations or
Warranties (other than Section 5.13), (ii) a breach by the Selling Companies
of Section 5.7(d), (iii) the Other Business, the Other Business Transfer, the
Other Business Liabilities, or any other Liabilities or matters relating to
the Spin-Off or the Spin-Off Entities, (iv) any deficit in the Working
Capital Escrow Amounts, (v) any indemnification pursuant to Section 12.1 for
Losses or Taxes relating to the Spin-Off, or (vi) acts of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach. Any claims by a Parent Indemnified Party
against the Indemnification Escrow Funds with respect to acts of fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful breach shall be solely to the portion
of such Indemnification Escrow Funds which the Stockholder committing the
acts of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach would otherwise
be entitled, and following any such recovery by a Parent Indemnified Party
from the Indemnification Escrow Funds, the amounts that such Stockholder
would be entitled to receive under this Agreement shall be reduced by the
amount of any such recovery.



(ii) All indemnifiable Losses of the Parent Indemnified Parties shall first be
paid from the Holding Cash Escrow Amount and the Fluent Cash Escrow Amount,
pro rata on the basis of such amounts, and then only after such Holding Cash
Escrow Amount and Fluent Cash Escrow Amount is depleted from the Stock Escrow
Amount.



(d) _Indemnification Escrow Period; Distribution of Indemnification Escrow
Funds upon Termination of Indemnification Escrow Period_. Subject to the
following requirements, the Indemnification Escrow Funds shall be in existence
immediately following the Fourth Effective Time and shall terminate at 11:59
p.m. New York City time on the Indemnification Cut-Off Date (the period of
time from the Fourth Effective Time through and including 11:59 p.m. New York
City time on the Indemnification Cut-Off Date is referred to herein as the "
_Indemnification Escrow Period_ "); and any Holding Cash Escrow Amount,
Fluent Cash Escrow Amount or Stock Escrow Amount thereafter remaining in the
Indemnification Escrow Funds shall be distributed as set forth in the last
sentence of this Section 11.3(d);  _provided_ __, _however_ , that the
Indemnification Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to such amount
of the Holding Cash Escrow Amount, Fluent Cash Escrow Amount and/or Stock
Escrow Amount as may be necessary in the good faith judgment of Parent,
subject to the objection of the Stockholders Representative and the
subsequent arbitration of the matter in the  



 

95  manner as provided in Section 11.3(h), to satisfy any unsatisfied claims
under Section 11.3 concerning facts and circumstances existing prior to the
termination of the Indemnification Escrow Period which claims are specified in
any Officers Certificate delivered to the Indemnification Escrow Agent and
the Stockholders Representative prior to termination of the
Indemnification Escrow Period. As soon as all such claims, if any, have been
resolved, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Master Escrow
Agent the remaining portion of the Indemnification Escrow Funds not required
to satisfy such claims, with any remaining Holding Cash Escrow Amount and/or
Stock Escrow Amount delivered to the Master Escrow Agent for deposit into the
Holding Master Escrow Fund and any remaining Fluent Cash Escrow Amount in the
Indemnification Escrow Funds delivered to the Master Escrow Agent for deposit
into the Fluent Master Escrow Fund.



(e) _Protection of Indemnification Escrow Funds_. The Indemnification Escrow
Agent shall hold and safeguard the Indemnification Escrow Funds during the
Indemnification Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent
and shall hold and dispose of the Indemnification Escrow Funds only in
accordance with the terms hereof. At all times during which the
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall hold all or any portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Funds, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall invest
and reinvest the Indemnification Escrow Funds, at the written direction of the
Stockholders Representative, in one or more of the following investments:
(i) direct obligations of, or obligations the principal and interest on which
are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of America, (ii)
repurchase agreements with the Indemnification Escrow Agent involving
securities of the kind described in the immediately preceding clause (i), or
(iii) money market funds authorized to invest in short term securities issued
or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States government
and repurchase agreements with respect to such securities. Any interest,
dividends or other income earned as a result of such investments shall be
added to and become part of the Indemnification Escrow Funds and shall be
retained in the Indemnification Escrow Funds and shall be available to
satisfy any claims made upon the Indemnification Escrow Funds and shall
thereafter be distributed pursuant to Section 11.3(d), _provided_ , _however_
that within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter, commencing
March 31, 2007, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Master
Escrow Agent from the Indemnification Escrow Fund an amount equal to forty
percent (40%) of the income earned for U.S. federal income tax purposes on
the Indemnification Escrow Fund during such immediately preceding calendar
quarter. Any interest or other income earned on the Indemnification Escrow
Funds will be included in the gross income of the Stockholders. In connection
with the letter of transmittal to be completed after Closing, each Stockholder
shall provide the Indemnification Escrow Agent with a certified tax
identification number by furnishing form W-9 or W-8, as appropriate, and any
other forms and documents that the Indemnification Escrow Agent may
reasonably request. If such Stockholders do not provide the information
required in the prior sentence, the Indemnification Escrow Agent may withhold
a portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment of the
Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance with applicable requirements of the
Code.



 

96 (f) _Claims Upon Indemnification Escrow Funds_.



(i) Upon receipt by the Indemnification Escrow Agent at any time on or before
the last day of the Indemnification Escrow Period of a certificate signed by
any officer of Parent (an " _Officer s Certificate_"): (A) stating that
Parent or another Parent Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, sustained or
accrued (or anticipates that it will pay, incur, sustain or accrue) Losses and
(B) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Loss included in
the amount so stated, the date (if known) when each such item of Loss was
incurred or sustained (or, in the case of anticipated Losses, the basis for
such anticipated Loss), and the general nature of the representation,
warranty, agreement or covenant or other matter to which such item of Loss or
anticipated Loss is related, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall, subject
to the provisions of Section 11.3(g), deliver to Parent out of the
Indemnification Escrow Funds, as promptly as practicable, cash and/or Parent
Common Stock (subject to Section 11.3(c)(ii)) out of the Indemnification
Escrow Funds in an amount equal to such Losses. Where the basis for a claim
upon the Indemnification Escrow Funds by Parent is that Parent (or another
Parent Indemnified Party) anticipates that it will pay, incur, sustain or
accrue a Loss, no payment will be made from the Indemnification Escrow Funds
for such Loss unless and until such Loss is actually incurred or sustained.



(ii) For purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
for any distribution from the Indemnification Escrow Funds, the per share
value of the Parent Common Stock shall equal the Closing Price.



(g) _Objections to Claims_. A copy of the Officers Certificate shall be
delivered to the Stockholders Representative substantially contemporaneously
with the delivery of the Officers Certificate to the Indemnification Escrow
Agent, and for a period of ten (10) Business Days after such delivery to the
Stockholders Representative and the Indemnification Escrow Agent, the
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to Parent of any portion
of the Indemnification Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 11.3(f) unless the
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from
the Stockholders Representative to make such delivery. After the expiration
of such ten (10) Business Day period, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall
make delivery of cash and/or Parent Common Stock from the Indemnification
Escrow Funds in accordance with Section 11.3(f), _provided_ that no such
payment or delivery may be made if the Stockholders Representative shall
object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officers Certificate
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for objection, and such statement
shall have been delivered to the Indemnification Escrow Agent prior to 5:00
p.m. New York City time on the last day of such ten (10) Business Day
period. 



(h) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.



(i) If the Stockholders Representative has objected in writing to any claim
or claims made in any Officers Certificate in accordance with the procedures
of this Section 11.3(h), the Stockholders Representative and Parent shall
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholders Representative and Parent
so agree, a memorandum setting forth  



 

97  such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be
furnished to the Indemnification Escrow Agent. The Indemnification Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and to distribute cash
and/or Parent Common Stock from the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance
with the terms thereof.



(ii) If no such agreement is reached after good-faith negotiations, either
Parent or the Stockholders Representative may demand arbitration of the
dispute unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in a pending Action
involving a Third Party Claim, in which event arbitration shall not be
commenced until such amount is determined in such Action (whether by verdict,
judgment, finding of fact, settlement or other order, stipulation or
agreement) or otherwise ascertained, or both parties agree to arbitration; and
in either event, the matter shall be resolved by confidential
arbitration conducted by three arbitrators, one selected by Parent, one
selected by the Stockholders Representative, and the third selected jointly
by the two (2) arbitrators previously selected by Parent and the Stockholders
Representative. The arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish
procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery of information
relating to any dispute while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate as
determined in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant
information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute.
The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel, limit or allow discovery as
they shall deem appropriate given the nature and extent of the disputed
claim. The arbitrators shall also have the authority to impose sanctions,
including attorneys fees and other costs incurred by the parties, to the same
extent as a court of law or equity, if the arbitrators determine that
discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was
refused or objected to by a party without substantial justification. The
decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and amount
of any claim in such Officers Certificate shall be binding and conclusive
upon the parties to this Agreement and the Stockholders, and, notwithstanding
anything in Section 11.3(g), the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold
payments out of the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance therewith. Such
decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact
and conclusions of law regarding the dispute, which shall set forth the
award, judgment, decree or order of the arbitrators.



(iii) Judgment upon any award, judgment, decree or order rendered by the

such arbitration shall be held in Boston, Massachusetts under the commercial
rules of arbitration then in effect of the American Arbitration Association.
The expenses, fees of each arbitrator and administrative costs of the
arbitration shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Parent Indemnified
Parities (which amount shall be payable from the Indemnification Escrow
Funds) and fifty percent (50%) by the Principal Stockholders (on a pro rata
basis).

Parent shall deposit with an escrow agent selected by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Selling Companies (the " _Master Escrow Agent_ "), (i) for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Holding Stock and Company Stock

connection with this Agreement. The Master Escrow Agent shall invest and
reinvest the Holding Master Escrow and the Fluent Master Escrow at the
written direction of the Stockholders Representative. To the extent that

Subsidiaries or the Surviving Companies shall be responsible for such losses.
The Holding Master Escrow and the Fluent Master Escrow shall terminate when
the Principal Stockholder Indemnifying Parties and the Stockholders
Representative have notified the Master Escrow Agent in writing that no
further claims will be made by the Principal Stockholder Indemnifying Parties
and the Stockholders Representative against the Holding Master Escrow and the
Fluent Master Escrow. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon delivery to the
Stockholders Representative of a contribution agreement in form and substance

Stockholders Pro Rata Cash Amount, Stockholders Pro Rata Stock Amount and/or
Fluent Stockholders Pro Rata Cash Amount) shall be delivered to the Exchange
Agent for delivery pursuant to Article IV.



Section 11.4 _Third Party Claims_.



(a) A Parent Indemnified Party shall give the Stockholders Representative
written notice of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding by or in respect
of a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") in respect of which such Parent
Indemnified Party may seek (i) recourse from the Indemnification Escrow Funds
or as to which the Deductible Amount may be applied or (ii) indemnification
from the Principal Stockholder Indemnifying Parties as soon as is practicable
and in any event within 20 Business Days after the receipt of such written
Third Party Claim or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
so notify the Stockholders Representative shall not affect rights of the
Parent Indemnified Parties to indemnification hereunder except to the extent
that the rights of the Stockholders hereunder are materially prejudiced by
such failure. Within 15 Business Days after the receipt of such notice, the
Stockholders Representative shall have the right to elect, at its option and
through counsel of its own choosing (who shall be reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Surviving Companies), to assume the defense or  



 

99  settlement of any such Third Party Claim or proceeding at its own expense;
_provided_ that in connection with such assumption the
Stockholders Representative provides such applicable Parent Indemnified
Party a full release of any costs or other expenses in connection therewith.
If the Stockholders Representative elects to assume the defense of any such
Third Party Claim or proceeding and complies with the foregoing sentence, the
Stockholders Representative shall (A) provide prompt notice of such election
(and in any event within 15) Business Days after the receipt of such written
Third Party Claim) to the Parent Indemnified Party, (B) promptly provide to
Parent and its counsel all material information related to such Third Party
Claim and related proceedings (including copies of written information), (C)
consider in good faith the views of Parent and its counsel regarding such
Third Party Claim and (D) seek the consent of Parent and its counsel (not to
be unreasonably withheld, it being agreed that a material adverse effect on
Parents business and operations shall be deemed to be a reasonable basis to
withhold consent) prior to any settlement or compromise of such Third Party
Claim and related proceedings unless such settlement or compromise shall
consist only of the payment of money by the Stockholders Representative and
includes a full release of such Parent Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, such Parent Indemnified Party shall at all
times have the right to fully participate in such defense at its own expense
directly or through counsel; _provided_ , _however_ , if the named parties to
the action or proceeding include both a Stockholder and a Parent Indemnified
Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, the
reasonable expense of separate counsel for such Parent Indemnified Party shall
be paid from the Indemnification Escrow Funds or by the Principal Stockholder
Indemnifying Parties, as applicable,  _provided_ that only one counsel for
the Parent Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction shall be required. Subject
to applicable Laws, a Parent Indemnified Party shall provide, upon reasonable
notice, the Stockholders Representative and counsel with reasonable access
to its records and personnel reasonably relating to any such Third Party
Claim, assertion, event or proceeding during normal business hours and shall
otherwise cooperate with any reasonable request of the Stockholders
Representative in the defense or settlement thereof; _provided_ that (x) that
such cooperation does not unduly interfere with the business of any such
Parent Indemnified Party, (y) such Parent Indemnified Party shall be
reimbursed from the Indemnification Escrow Funds or by the Principal
Stockholder Indemnifying Parties, as applicable, for all reasonable and
necessary out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such Parent Indemnified
Party in connection with any such request and (z) such Parent Indemnified
Party shall not be required to permit any of the foregoing activities that
would (1) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties, or
any trade secrets of any Parent Indemnified Party or of any of their
respective Affiliates unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (2) violate any obligations of any Parent Indemnified Party or
their respective Affiliates to any third party with respect to
confidentiality or (3) reasonably be expected, in the opinion of counsel, to
have the effect of causing the waiver of any attorney-client privilege. If the
Stockholders Representative elects to direct the defense of any such claim
or proceeding, Parent Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid,
any part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability unless
the Stockholders Representative consents in writing to such payment or unless
the Stockholders Representative, subject to the last sentence of this
Section 11.4(a), withdraws from the defense of such asserted liability or
unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken is entered against
Parent Indemnified Party for such liability. If the Stockholders
Representative receiving notice of a Third Party Claim does not elect to
defend such Third Party Claim or if the  



 

100  Stockholders Representative fails to defend in good faith or if, after
commencing or undertaking any such defense, the Stockholders Representative
fails to prosecute in good faith or withdraws from such defense, Parent
Indemnified Party shall have the right, in addition to any other right or
remedy it may have hereunder, to undertake the defense or settlement thereof
(with counsel selected by the Parent Indemnified Party), and such expenses
incurred by a Parent Indemnified Party shall be recoverable from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds or the Principal Stockholder Indemnifying
Parties, as applicable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Parent Indemnified
Party shall not settle, compromise or discharge, or admit any liability with
respect to, any such Third Party Claim without the written consent of the
Stockholders Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).



(b) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
hereunder for any Loss arising from a breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant set forth herein (and the amount of any Loss incurred in respect
of such breach shall not be included in the calculation of any limitations on
indemnification set forth herein) to the extent that such liability is accrued
in the Estimated Net Working Capital or the Closing Net Working Capital.



(c) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
for any consequential, exemplary or punitive damages unless such damages are
assessed against any of the Parent Indemnified Parties in a Third Party Claim.



Section 11.5 _Indemnification Escrow Agent s Duties_.



(a) _Limitation on Duties of Indemnification Escrow Agent_. The
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of

believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper
party or parties. The Indemnification Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any

been entered without jurisdiction or proper authority.

or permitted by him, her or it in good faith in accordance with the advice of
counsel. The Indemnification Escrow Agent is not responsible for determining
and verifying the authority of any Person acting or purporting to act on
behalf of any party to this Agreement.



(e)  _Non-Responsibility of Indemnification Escrow Agent_. If any controversy
arises between or among the parties to this Agreement, or with any other
Person, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or
conditions, the Indemnification Escrow Agent will not be required to
determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The
Indemnification Escrow Agent may hold all documents and cash and may wait for
settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or
other means as, in the Indemnification Escrow Agents discretion, the
Indemnification Escrow Agent may be required, despite what may be set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Indemnification Escrow Agent
will not be liable for any damages. Furthermore, the Indemnification Escrow
Agent may at its option file an action of interpleader requiring the parties
to answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The
Indemnification Escrow Agent is authorized to deposit with the clerk of the
court all documents and cash and/or Parent Common Stock held in escrow, except
all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the
Indemnification Escrow Agent due to the interpleader action and which the
parties jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon commencing such action and
making such deposit, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be fully released
and discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms
of this Agreement.



(f)  _Indemnification of Indemnification Escrow Agent_. Parent and its
successors and assigns agree to indemnify and hold the Indemnification Escrow
Agent harmless against any and all Losses incurred by the Indemnification
Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of the Indemnification Escrow
Agents duties under this Agreement, including any litigation arising from
this Agreement or involving its subject matter.



(g) _Resignation of Indemnification Escrow Agent_. The Indemnification Escrow
Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least 30 calendar days written
notice to the parties; _provided_ __, _however_ __, that no such resignation
shall become effective until the appointment of a successor Indemnification
Escrow Agent which shall be accomplished as follows: Parent and Stockholders
 Representative shall use their reasonable best efforts to mutually agree on
a  



 

102  successor Indemnification Escrow Agent within 30 calendar days after
receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor escrow
agent within such time, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall have the right
to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the State of
Delaware. The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument
accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with
all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor
depositary agent as if originally named as Indemnification Escrow Agent. The
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall thereupon be discharged from any further
duties and liability under this Agreement.



(h) _Fees_. All fees of the Indemnification Escrow Agent for performance of
its duties hereunder shall be paid by Parent. In the event that the conditions
of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Indemnification
Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the
parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any controversy
arises (other than claims against the Indemnification Escrow
Funds, objections to claims and arbitrations as contemplated by Sections
11.3(f), (g) and (h)), or if the Indemnification Escrow Agent is made a party
to, or intervenes in, any Action pertaining to the Escrow, this Article XI or
its subject matter, the Indemnification Escrow Agent shall be entitled to be
reasonably compensated by Parent and the Stockholders Representative.

agreements contained herein, except (i) to terminate this Agreement pursuant

this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, or any other certificate, agreement
or instrument executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement by any Person
subject hereto will result in irreparable injury to the other parties hereto,
that the remedy at Law alone will be an inadequate remedy for such breach, and
that, in addition to any other remedies which they may have, such other
parties may enforce their respective rights by actions for
specific performance (to the extent permitted by Law).



(b) From and after the Closing, the rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties
to recourse for, and indemnification relating to, breaches of representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement shall be limited to
those contained in this Article XI and in Article XII, and such recourse and
indemnification rights shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent
Indemnified Parties subsequent to the Closing Date with respect to any matter

any Loss claimed by the Parent Indemnified Parties after the Fourth Effective
Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event of any
acts of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach, the parties
shall have all remedies available at Law or in equity (including for tort)

_ARTICLE XII - TAX MATTERS_



The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility
as between Parent and the Selling Companies and Stockholders for certain Tax
matters following the Closing Date:



Section 12.1 _Tax Indemnification_.



(a) Each of the Stockholders on their own behalf and on behalf of their
successors, executors, administrators, estate, heirs and assigns agree,
subject to the provisions and limitations set forth in this Article XII, to
severally, with respect to their pro rata amount of the Merger Consideration,
and not jointly, indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties and hold  



 

106  them harmless from and against (i) all Losses of any kind or nature
whatsoever, which may be sustained or suffered by any such Parent Indemnified
Party based upon, arising out of, or by reason of any breach or violation of,
inaccuracy in or omission from any representation or warranty contained in
Section 5.13, when made or deemed made as of the Closing Date of the Selling
Companies; (ii) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of each Selling
Company and its Subsidiaries (including all Taxes relating to the Spin-Off)
for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion
through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (iii) any
and all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or
unitary group of which any Selling Company or of its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or
any analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation, and (iv)
any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the applicable Selling Company and
its Subsidiaries) imposed on any Selling Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing, _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clauses (i) through (iv)
above, the Stockholders shall be liable only to the extent that such Losses
or Taxes are in excess of the amount, if any, accrued in the Final Net Working
Capital for Taxes and only after application of any net operating loss
carryforwards from taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and
capital loss carryforwards from taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date of the Selling Companies or its Subsidiaries to the extent such
attributes existed on or prior to the Closing Date, with any Tax benefit from
such Tax attributes being taken into account only at such time or times as
and to the extent that the Parent Indemnified Party actually realizes a Tax
benefit from such attribute through a refund of Tax or reduction in the actual
amount of Taxes which such Parent Indemnified Party would otherwise have had
to pay if such Tax attribute had not been available. Parent shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to cause such Tax attributes to be usable in
determining such Tax liability. Any dispute as to the amount or availability
of any such Tax attributes that cannot be resolved in good faith discussions
between the applicable parties shall be submitted to the Accounting Referee
and resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.8(b).
To the extent that the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to recover for
any of the foregoing Losses or Taxes (to the extent related to Income Taxes
and Taxes attributable to the Spin-Off) and the amount in the Indemnification
Escrow Funds is insufficient or the Indemnification Escrow Funds are not
available, the Principal Stockholder Indemnifying Parties shall, subject to
the provisions and limitations set forth in this Article XII, severally, with
respect to their pro rata amount of the Merger Consideration, and not
jointly, reimburse the Parent Indemnified Parties therefor within 15 Business
Days after payment of such Taxes by a Parent Indemnified Party.



(b) Each of the Stockholders agrees severally, with respect to their pro rata
amount of the Merger Consideration, and not jointly, to contribute to any
amounts paid by the Principal Stockholders pursuant to Section 12.1(a) in
accordance with the terms of the Holding Master Escrow, the Fluent Master
Escrow and, as applicable, the contribution agreement referred to in Section
11.3(i).



(c) With respect to Taxes attributable to the Spin-Off and Income Taxes which
may be sustained or suffered by any Parent Indemnified Party as set forth in
 



 

107  Section 12.1(a), the Parent Indemnified Parties shall prior to the
Indemnification Cut-Off Date first seek recovery related thereto for up to
$5,000,000 from the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance with the
provisions of Section 11.3 and thereafter may seek indemnification, without
regard to the Indemnification Escrow Funds, from the Principal Stockholder
Indemnifying Parties. 



(d) Parent Indemnified Party may not make any claims pursuant to Section
12.1(a) above for the amount of any Taxes (other than Taxes attributable to
the Spin-Off) unless and until the aggregate indemnifiable Losses and Taxes
pursuant to this Article XII or Article XI equal or exceed the Deductible
Amount, and then only such Losses and Taxes that exceed the Deductible Amount
shall be recoverable by the Parent Indemnified Parties in accordance with the
terms hereof. Notwithstanding any other contrary provision of this Agreement,
any Taxes attributable to the Spin-Off shall not be subject to the Deductible
Amount.



(e) Notwithstanding any other contrary provision of this Agreement, (i) the
amount of any Income Taxes and any Taxes attributable to the Spin-Off and, in
each case, any Losses relating thereto, that may be recovered by the Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article XII and Section 11.2(b) in the
aggregate shall be limited to the amount of proceeds received by
the Principal Stockholder Indemnifying Parties in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the amount of any Taxes
and Losses related thereto other than those described in (i) that may be
recovered by the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be limited to the
Indemnification Escrow Funds. For purposes of this Agreement, if a Principal
Stockholder Indemnifying Party sells or otherwise transfers any Parent Common
Stock received in the Mergers, the proceeds received by such Principal
Stockholder Indemnifying Party shall mean the cash proceeds received by such
Principal Stockholder Indemnifying Party in connection with such sale (net of
any commissions). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) any
Taxes recovered by Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Article XII shall
not be recoverable pursuant to any other Article of this Agreement and (B) the
Stockholders shall have no indemnification obligation under this
Agreement due to a reduction of net operating losses or capital loss
carryforwards (but, in each case, only to the extent such net operating losses
or carryforwards existed on or prior to the Closing Date) carried forward to
periods after the Closing or any limitations on the usability of such Tax
attributes unless such reduction or limitation actually increases the Tax
liability of a Parent Indemnified Party.



(f) Notwithstanding any other contrary provision of this Agreement, in
determining indemnifiable Losses and Taxes under this Article XII, the
provisions of Section 11.2(d) shall be applied.



Section 12.2 _Straddle Periods_. In the case of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the
amount of any Taxes for the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (a) in
the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis (such as real property
Taxes), be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of
such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the applicable Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire relevant Straddle Period and (b) in the case of Taxes that are
not described in clause (a) above (such as Income Taxes, Taxes imposed in
connection with  



 

108  any sale or other transfer or assignment of property, and payroll and
similar Taxes), be deemed to be equal to the amount that would have been
payable if the taxable year or period of the Company ended on the Closing
Date; _provided_ , that, in determining such amount, exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on a periodic basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, shall be taken into account on a pro-rated basis in the manner
described in clause (a) above.



Section 12.3 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. Parent shall prepare or
cause to be prepared at its own cost, all Tax Returns for the Selling
Companies and their Subsidiaries that are filed after the Closing Date.
Parent shall provide draft versions of such Tax Returns to the Stockholders
Representative not later than 30 days prior to the extended due date for
filing such Tax Returns. The Stockholders Representative shall notify Parent
of any proposed changes not later than 15 days after delivery of such draft
Tax Returns pursuant to the preceding sentence. Parent shall make changes to
such draft Tax Returns that are reasonably requested by the
Stockholders Representative to the extent such changes (a) are with respect
to a position or item that was initially reported on such draft Tax Returns in
a manner inconsistent with the past practices of the applicable Selling
Company and such changes, (b) if accepted, would cause such position or item
to be consistent with the past practices of such Selling Company; _provided_ ,
that Parent shall have no obligation to accept any changes requested by the
Stockholders Representative if, in Parents reasonable judgment, such
changes would result in a material increase in the amount of Taxes owed with
respect to a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall have joint
control over the treatment of the Spin-Off and shall use their best efforts to
mutually agree on such treatment that is consistent with the intended Tax
treatment described in this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
and the Stockholders Representative agree that the Spin-Off shall be treated
and reported for all Tax purposes and for purposes of this Agreement as
occurring in the Pre-Closing Tax Period; and  _provided_ _further_ that any
dispute as to the proper treatment of an item relating to the Spin Off that
cannot be resolved in good faith discussions between the Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall be submitted to the Accounting Referee and
resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.8(b). Parent
shall cause the Selling Companies and their Subsidiaries to file all Tax
Returns described in this Section 12.3 on or prior to their extended due
dates.



Section 12.4 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.



(a) Parent, the Principal Stockholders and the Selling Companies and their
Subsidiaries shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision
of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available, including,
without limitation, those employees identified on _Schedule 12.4_ , on a
mutually convenient basis, without the incurrence by Parent of any fees or
expenses related thereto, to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Principal Stockholders
and the Selling Companies and their Subsidiaries agree (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Selling Companies and
their Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
 



 

109  extent notified by Parent, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Tax Authority, and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other party so requests, any Selling Company and its Subsidiaries
or the Principal Stockholders, as the case may be, shall allow the other
party to take possession of such books and records.



(b) Parent, the Principal Stockholders and the Selling Companies and their
Subsidiaries and the Principal Stockholders further agree, upon request, to
provide the other party with all information that either party may be required
to report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.



(c) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, as determined in the good
faith judgment of Parent, after the Closing, none of the Selling Companies
shall make or change any Tax election, change any method of Tax accounting,
file or amend any Tax Return, settle any audit, claim, examination
or deficiency litigation with respect to Taxes, request any private letter or
similar Tax ruling or enter into any closing agreement with any Tax Authority
with respect to any amount of Taxes, in each case with respect to a taxable
period ending prior to the Closing Date, without, in each case, providing at
least ten (10) days notice to the Stockholders Representative and, to the
extent that the Stockholders Representative notifies Parent within such ten-
day period that the Stockholders Representative reasonably believes that
such action will cause a material adverse effect on the Stockholders
indemnity obligations under this Agreement, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to accommodate any reasonable requests by the Stockholders
Representative.



Section 12.5 _Tax-Sharing Agreements_. All tax-sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving any Selling Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing
Date, no Selling Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or
have any liability thereunder.



Section 12.6 _Certain Taxes and Fees_. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Article XII, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties, interest and additional
amounts with respect thereto) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than the Spin-Off) shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Parent and
fifty percent (50%) by the Stockholders. For the avoidance of doubt, all
Transfer Taxes relating to the Spin-Off shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 12.1.



_ARTICLE XIII - TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_



Section 13.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the First Effective Time, whether before or after the execution of
the Stockholder Written Consents:



(a) by the mutual written consent of Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger
Subs) and the Selling Companies; 



 

110 (b) by either the Selling Companies, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger
Subs, on the other hand, by written notice to the other:



(i) if a Court or Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order or taken
any other action, in each case, which has become final and non-appealable and
which restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the Mergers; or



(ii) if the consummation of the Mergers shall not have occurred after April
3, 2006 and on or before 5:00 p.m. New York City time on July 31, 2006;
_provided_ that if the Mergers shall not have been consummated solely due to
any approval from the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
United Stated Department of Justice or such similar foreign or domestic
Governmental Authority not having been received, then such date shall be
extended for not more than six (6) months to allow more time for such approval
to be obtained; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 13.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Mergers to occur on or before
such date;



(c) by Parent, if the Mergers shall not have been approved as provided in
Section 10.1 hereof pursuant to the Stockholder Written Consents by the
applicable Stockholder Votes required in accordance with applicable Law and
the Charter Documents;



(d) by the Selling Companies, if the Selling Companies are not then in
material breach of any term of this Agreement, upon written notice to Parent,
upon a material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Parent
or Merger Subs contained in this Agreement, _provided_ that such breach is
not capable of being cured or has not been cured within 30 days after the
giving of notice thereof by the Selling Companies to Parent, such that the
conditions set forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.3 cannot be satisfied or cured
prior to the date set forth in Section 13.1(b)(ii);



(e) by Parent, if neither Parent nor any of the Merger Subs is then in
material breach of any term of this Agreement, upon written notice to the
Selling Companies, upon a material breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant of the Selling Companies contained in this Agreement, _provided_ that
such breach is not capable of being cured or has not been cured within 30
days after the giving of notice thereof by Parent or Merger Subs to the
Selling Companies, such that the conditions set forth in Sections 10.1 and
10.2 cannot be satisfied or cured prior to the date set forth in Section
13.1(b)(ii); or

 



(f) by Parent, if at any time after approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the Mergers, holders of more than two and one half percent
(2.5%) of the outstanding shares of Selling Companies Stock (determined on an
as converted basis) shall have demanded appraisal, dissenters or
similar rights under applicable Law with respect to their shares.



 

111 Section 13.2 _Effect of Termination_.



(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections
13.1(a), (b), (d), (e) or (f), this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void and have no effect, without any Liability on the part of Parent, Merger
Subs or the Selling Companies and their respective directors, officers,
employees, partners or stockholders and all rights and obligations of any
party hereto shall cease, except for the agreements contained in Section 9.4,
Section 9.8, this Section 13.2 and Article XIV; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that nothing contained in this Section 13.2(a) shall relieve any party from
Liabilities or damages arising out of any fraud, intentional misrepresentation
or willful breach by such party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement.



(b) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
13.1(c), then the Selling Companies shall pay Parent for all of its out of
pocket expenses in connection with the negotiation and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including all expenses related to attorneys,
auditors, investment bankers, experts or any other third-party consultant ("
_Parent Expenses_ "), and shall pay such Parent Expenses by wire transfer of
same day funds on the date of termination of this Agreement.



Section 13.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at
any time before or after the execution of the Stockholder Written Consents;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the execution of the Stockholder Written
Consents, no amendment shall be made that by Law requires further approval by
the Stockholders without obtaining such approval. 



Section 13.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the First Effective
Time, the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such
waiver or extension is to be enforced. Waiver of any term or condition of this
Agreement by a party shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach or waiver of the same term or condition by such party, or a waiver of
any other term or condition of this Agreement by such party.

Section 14.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Schedules
and Exhibits hereto, the Ancillary Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement
and any documents executed by the parties simultaneously herewith or pursuant
thereto, constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, other than the Confidentiality Agreement (excluding the
provisions of this Agreement), which shall survive the execution of this
Agreement and any termination of this Agreement.



Section 14.3 _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation_. At any time or
from time to time after the Closing, the parties shall execute and deliver to
each other party such other documents and instruments, provide such materials
and information and take such other actions as the other party may reasonably
request to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to cause the other parties to fulfill their respective obligations
under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the rights of the various parties and their obligations to
provide information as set forth in Article XI shall be controlled by that
section of the Agreement.



Section 14.4 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of Parent and the Selling
Companies and, with respect to Article XI and Article XII only, the
Indemnification Escrow Agent, the Stockholders Representative and the
Principal Stockholder Indemnifying Parties, and their respective successors or
permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties to confer third-
party beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does not confer any such rights,
upon any other Person other than any Person entitled to indemnification under
Section 9.10 or to compensation from the Indemnification Escrow Funds under
Article XI and Article XII.



Section 14.5 _Assignment_. Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ ,  



 

114  that Parent may designate, by written notice to the Selling Companies,
another wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a party hereto in
lieu of any of the Merger Subs (so long as such designation does not
materially change the Tax treatment of the Mergers or the Spin-Off), in which
event all references herein to such Merger Sub shall be deemed references to
such other Subsidiary, except that any representations and warranties made
with respect to such Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be
deemed made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and the rights and
obligations set forth herein shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding
upon the parties hereto, and each of their respective successors, heirs and
permitted assign.



Section 14.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby,
and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable.



Section 14.7 _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations
among the parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this
Agreement shall not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement,
arrangement or understanding among the parties hereto unless and until (a)
each of the Selling Companies Boards has approved for purposes of Section 251
of the DGCL and any applicable provision of their respective certificates of
incorporation, the terms of this Agreement and (b) this Agreement is executed
by the parties hereto.



Section 14.8  _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference will be to an Article
or Section of, or a Schedule or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement will
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. All terms used herein with initial capital letters have the
meanings ascribed to them herein and all terms defined in this Agreement
will have such defined meanings when used in any certificate or other
document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute
defined or referred to herein, or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein, means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time
to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.



Section 14.9 _Survival_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Mergers, _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
those covenants and agreements contained  



 

115  herein that by their terms are to be performed after the applicable
Effective Time shall survive, including, without limitation, Articles III, XI
and XII, (b) those representations and warranties contained in Article V
shall survive until the period provided in Article XI, and (c) the provisions
of this Article XIV shall survive indefinitely.



Section 14.10 ___Fees and Expenses_. Subject to Section 13.2(b) hereof, and
except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, whether or not the Mergers
are consummated, Parent (on behalf of Parent and Merger Subs), on the one
hand, and the Selling Companies, on the other hand, shall bear their own
expenses in connection with the negotiation and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



Section 14.11 ___Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_. All disputes, claims
or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict
of laws. Each of the Selling Companies, Parent and Merger Subs hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") for any
litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in
such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
litigation in the Chosen Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Chosen
Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any
inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such
party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Delaware,
to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Delaware as such partys
agent for acceptance of legal process and (b) that service of process may also
be made on such party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing
receipt validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence
of valid service. Service made pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the
same legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the
State of Delaware. For purposes of implementing the parties agreement to
appoint and maintain an agent for service of process in the State of
Delaware, each of Parent and each of the Merger Subs does hereby appoint The
Corporation Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, in
the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware 19801, as
such agent. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in the Chosen Courts, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.



Section 14.12 ___Waiver of Trial by Jury_. IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING
HEREFROM, THE PARTIES HERETO CONSENT TO TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY HERETO OR ITS SUCCESSORS
AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR ITS SUCCESSORS IN RESPECT OF ANY MATTER
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY. 



 

116 Section 14.13 ___Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Except where this Agreement specifically provides for
arbitration, it is agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state or province having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.



Section 14.14 ___Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto are sophisticated and
have been represented by attorneys throughout the transactions contemplated
hereby who have carefully negotiated the provisions hereof. As a consequence,
the parties do not intend that the presumptions of laws or rules relating to
the interpretation of contracts against the drafter of any particular clause
should be applied to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument executed
in connection herewith, and therefore waive their effects.



Section 14.15 ___Miscellaneous_. This Agreement (a) shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefits of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns and is not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder and (b) may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. The Indemnification Escrow Agent may
execute this Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and
such later execution, if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect
the binding nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof among the
other signatories hereto.



_[Remainder of page intentionally left blank.]_



 

117 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Merger Agreement to be
signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of the
date first written above.
