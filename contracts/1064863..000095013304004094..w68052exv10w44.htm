reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in defense against such action

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;11.5 <U>Interpretation</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The words &#147;hereof,&#148; &#147;herein&#148; and &#147;herewith&#148; and words of similar
import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and
references to article, section, paragraph, exhibit and schedule are to the
articles, sections, paragraphs, exhibits and schedules of this Agreement unless
otherwise specified. The words describing the singular number shall include
the plural and vice versa, and words denoting any genders shall include all
genders. Whenever the words &#147;include,&#148; &#147;includes&#148; or &#147;including&#148; are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words &#147;without
limitation.&#148; The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Company Disclosure Schedule and the other schedules hereto shall
be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement as if the same had
been set forth verbatim herein. Any matter disclosed pursuant to any schedule
shall be deemed to be disclosed for the purpose indicated on such schedule, but
such disclosure shall not be deemed to be an admission or representation as to
the materiality of the item so disclosed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Headings are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;11.6 <U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be executed in
multiple counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be
deemed an original, and all of which shall together be considered one and the
same agreement.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;11.7 <U>Entire Agreements; Third Party Beneficiaries</U>. This
Agreement and the Schedules hereto, and the Ancillary Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement (i)&nbsp;constitute the entire agreement of the parties
and supersede all prior negotiations, discussions, disclosures, representations
and warranties, agreements and understandings, if any, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (ii)&nbsp;except as
specifically provided herein, is not intended to nor shall it confer, upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns
any rights, benefits, claims, or remedies hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;11.8 <U>Partial Invalidity</U>. Whenever possible, each
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, this Agreement shall be construed as if such
illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained in
this Agreement unless the deletion of such provision or
provisions would result in such a material change as to cause completion
of the transactions contemplated hereby to be unreasonable.
