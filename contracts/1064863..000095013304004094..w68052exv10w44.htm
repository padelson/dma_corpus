The Company will continue to use best efforts, and Buyer and Parent shall cooperate with such efforts, to obtain Support Agreements from the Company Members who did not execute such agreements on the date of this Agreement and will deliver a copy of any such Support Agreement to Buyer and Parent when they are executed.   

 (b) Buyer is merging with the Company with the understanding that the Company owns or leases the properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, tangible and intangible, of every type and description, which are used in the operation of the Business, including, without limitation, the property and assets which are acquired between the date hereof and the Closing Date and all claims and rights of the Company of every kind relating to the ownership of the Business, whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date, including deposits, prepayments, refunds, causes of action, choses in action, rights of recovery, rights of setoff, and rights of recoupment (collectively, the "Assets").

The Closing Cash Amount plus the Contingent MLTC Cash Amount, plus or minus the adjustment described in Sections 2.2(d)(ii), 2.2(d)(iii), 2.2(d)(viii), 2.2(e) and 2.4, are collectively referred to herein as the "Aggregate Consideration."   

 (ii) The Closing Cash Amount less the Dissenters Withhold Amount, if any, shall be paid to Agent at Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by Agent to Parent. The Dissenters Withhold Amount, if any, shall be deposited into the Escrow Account at Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by Escrow Agent to Parent. Wire transfer instructions shall be specified in writing not less than three (3) Business Days before the Closing. All other payments with respect to the Aggregate Consideration shall be paid to Agent or Escrow Agent, as the case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by Agent or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be.

 (iii) _Use of Escrow Account Funds_. The Escrow Account funds (which shall include the Contingent MLTC Cash Amount if payable pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) and additional amounts contributed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement) shall be used to satisfy    ##### 

  

 

Exhibit 10.44   

Company Members liabilities, if any, arising under Sections 2.2(d)(viii),
2.2(e), 2.4 and Article VIII, and shall be paid to Company Members as set

 (C) If funds otherwise payable to Agent from the Escrow Account pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) are, instead, retained by the Escrow Agent because of the existence of then-pending claims made by Company as successor to Buyer or Parent in good faith under Sections 2.2(d), 2.2(e), 2.4 and Article VIII, then Escrow Agent shall release such funds to Buyer or Agent, as the case may be, upon final resolution of the claims within the period set forth under Section 2.2(d)(viii), 2.2(e), Section 2.4 or Article VIII, as extended under such provisions.

 (ii) If the Unaudited Closing Balance Sheet shows (i) a Preliminary Closing Book Value of less than Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000), then Parent shall reduce the Closing Cash Amount and the Aggregate Consideration shall decrease, by an amount equal to the difference between Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) and the Preliminary Closing Book Value.   

 (iii) If the Unaudited Closing Balance Sheet shows a Preliminary Closing Book Value of more than Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000), then the Closing Cash Amount and the Aggregate Consideration shall increase by the excess of the Preliminary Closing Book Value over Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) and such amount shall be deposited by Parent into the Escrow Account.   

 (iv) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Company to prepare and deliver to GGK, Agent and Parent consolidated financial statements of the Company for the period from the first day of the fiscal year that includes the Closing Date through the Closing Date, including, a balance sheet as of the Closing Date, an income statement for the period from the first day of the fiscal year that includes the Closing Date through the Closing Date, related footnotes and supporting schedules prepared in accordance with GAAP. Through March 31, 2005, Parent will fully cooperate with GGK in filing the 2004 MMCOR for the Company.   

 (v) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent will cause GGK to deliver to Agent and Parent the final audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the period from the first day of the fiscal year that includes the Closing Date through the Closing Date, including a balance sheet as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and income statements for the period from the first day of the fiscal year that includes the Closing Date through the Closing Date, related footnotes and supporting schedules prepared in accordance with GAAP (the "Final Financial Statements").

Exhibit 10.44   

Sheet and the recomputation of the Closing Book Value. Within 30 days of
receipt of such conclusion, Parent and Agent will either agree to accept the
Closing Balance Sheet or shall submit the dispute to an
Independent Accountant in accordance with Section 11.2 below. Once accepted
by the parties or on the issuance of a determination by the Independent
Accountant, the Closing Balance Sheet will be deemed final and binding on the
parties.   

 (viii) If the Final Financial Statements show that the Closing Book Value differs from the Preliminary Closing Book Value, then within five Business Days after the Closing Balance Sheet is deemed to be final as set forth in Section 2.2(d)(vii) above, (A) the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Parent the amount, if any, by which the Closing Book Value is less than the Preliminary Closing Book Value; or (B) Parent shall deposit the amount, if any, by which the Closing Book Value exceeds the Preliminary Closing Book Value to the Escrow Account. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent is entitled to a Payment from Escrow Account under any provision of this Agreement but the funds in the Escrow Account are insufficient to make such payment, Parents claim shall continue and be paid when additional funds are deposited into the Escrow Account from any source; provided, nevertheless, that no claim asserted by Parent or Buyer shall be paid from funds deposited in the Escrow Account in excess of the first $11,000,000 of such deposits exclusive of Dissenters Withhold Amount deposited to the Escrow Account by Agent, Parent, Buyer, Company Member or Company which excess shall not be subject to Parent or Buyer claims for any reason.   

 (e) _Aggregate Consideration Adjustment_. The $125,000,000 provided for in Section 2.2(a)(i) is based on the Company having Premium Revenue equal to $16.53 million (the "Membership Premium Threshold") for the full calendar month including the Closing Date (the "Final Month"). The Companys Premium Revenue for the Final Month shall be determined by the Parent within 90 days of the Closing Date and the computation thereof together with supporting work papers shall be delivered by Parent to Agent as such time, whereupon it will be subject to the review and resolution provisions of Section 2.2(d). If the Companys Premium Revenue for the Final Month is less than the Membership Premium Threshold, then the $125,000,000 shall be adjusted to an amount equal to the product of the $125,000,000 and the actual Premium Revenues divided by the Membership Premium Threshold and Escrow Agent shall pay $125,000,000 minus such adjusted amount to Parent at the time required by Section 2.2(d)(viii). If the Companys Premium Revenue for the Final Month exceeds the Membership Premium Threshold, then the $125,000,000 shall be adjusted to an amount equal to the product of the $125,000,000 and the actual Premium Revenues divided by the Membership Premium Threshold and Parent shall deposit such adjusted amount in excess of the $125,000,000 into the Escrow Account at the time required by Section 2.2(d)(viii).   

 (f) _Consummation and Effect of Merger_. The parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing duly executed Certificate of Merger with the New York State Department of State (the "Department of State"), in such form as Buyer and Agent reasonably determine is required by, and is in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the NY LLC Law ("Certificate of Merger").

 (i) each issued and outstanding share of Buyer (which shall have 100 issued and outstanding shares at Closing) shall be converted into a 1% membership interest of the Company (which will be the surviving entity of the Merger);   

 (ii) each Membership Interest (except for those Membership Interests held by Dissenting Members) shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist and shall be converted into the right for the holder of such Membership Interest to receive, in cash, an amount equal to the sum of the following:   

       | (1)  | an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on its
Percentage Interest) of the Closing Cash Amount minus any
Dissenters Withhold Amount (the "Allocated Closing Cash Amount");  
---|---|--- 
      
      | (2)  | an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on its

Percentage Interest) of the portion of the Contingent Payment not deposited

      | in each case rounded to the nearest whole cent (the "Merger
Consideration"). The Merger Consideration shall be paid to the Agent for the
benefit of Company Members, to be distributed to Company Members
in accordance with their Percentage Interest upon receipt of documentation
as reasonably required by the Agent.  
     

 (g) _Dissenting Shares; Waiver of Dissenter s Rights_ _._  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Membership Interests that are issued and outstanding immediately before the Statutory Effective Time and which are held by Company Members (i) who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing, and (ii) who shall have delivered a written notice of dissent from the proposed Merger in accordance with Section 1002(e) of the NY LLC Law and otherwise perfected their rights under Section 1002(e) of the NY LLC Law shall be converted into and represent the right to receive a portion of the Aggregate Consideration and shall be deemed cancelled. Such Company Members (the "Dissenting Members") shall be entitled to only receive payment of the value of such Membership Interests held by them in accordance with the provisions of the NY LLC Law, except that all Membership Interests held by members who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Membership Interests pursuant to relevant provisions of the NY LLC Law, shall thereupon be deemed to have been    ##### 

  

  

Exhibit 10.44  

converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Statutory Effective
Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon, such members
allocated share of the Aggregate Consideration. The Company shall comply with
Section 1005 of the NY LLC Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall withhold from payment of the Closing
Cash Amount payable to Agent for the benefit of Company Members hereunder and
instead pay to Escrow Agent, 200% of the Dissenting Members Percentage
Interests times $120,000,000 (the "Dissenters Withhold Amount"). Escrow
Agent shall hold the Dissenters Withhold Amount until such time as the
Dissenting Member and Agent agree to settle the dispute or the final,
unappealable amount of payment is determined for the Dissenting Members
Membership Interests under the NY LLC Law, at which time Agent shall
distribute (A) such amount ("Dissenters Allocable Consideration") to the
Dissenting Members in accordance with the NY LLC Law, (B) any Losses for
which Dissenting Member is responsible under Section 8.1(a)(ii)(B) to the
Parent, and (C) the balance to the Agent for distribution to Signing Members
pro rata in accordance with their Percentage Interests.   

 (h) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. On any reclassification, membership interest split, membership interest dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into membership interests, reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to membership interests occurring (or for which a record date is established)) after the date hereof and before the Statutory Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect fully such event.   

 (i) _No Further Ownership Rights in Membership Interest_. The Aggregate Consideration paid or to be paid to Agent on behalf of Company Members on the Closing Date shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Membership Interests, and from and after the Statutory Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the books of Company of Membership Interests which were outstanding immediately before the Statutory Effective Time.   

 Section 2.3 _Contingent Payment_.   

 (a) As additional consideration for the Merger, Parent shall pay an additional amount to Company Members (the "Contingent Payment") as follows: (i) if Contingent Payment EBITDA exceeds $11,200,000 (the "Minimum EBITDA Amount"), but is less than $21,200,000 (the "EBITDA Target"), then the Contingent Payment shall be the amount by which Contingent Payment EBITDA exceeds the Minimum EBITDA Amount and (ii) if Contingent Payment EBITDA is equal to or greater than the EBITDA Target, then the Contingent Payment shall be $10,000,000.   

 (b) By no later than the last day of the fourth month following the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to Agent a certificate (the "Final EBITDA Certificate"), verified for accuracy and signed by Parent chief financial officer, (i) attaching the financial statements of the Company for 2005 as audited by KPMG including, among other statements and schedules, an income statement, notes thereto and KPMGs report thereon (the "Audited 2005 Financial Statements") plus the Companys unaudited financial statements for any period in 2006 needed to include the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date ("Stub Period Financials") and (ii) setting forth Parents calculation of Contingent Payment EBITDA based    ##### 

  

 

Exhibit 10.44   

upon the Audited 2005 Financial Statements and Stub Period Financials (the
"Estimated EBITDA Amount"). If, within 30 days after the Final EBITDA
Certificate is delivered to Agent, Agent shall not have given written notice
to Parent setting forth in detail any objection to the Estimated EBITDA
Amount, then such Estimated EBITDA Amount shall be the Contingent Payment
EBITDA for purposes of this Agreement and shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and Parent shall immediately deposit into the Escrow Account
and pay to Agent for the benefit of Company Members, as provided in Section
2.3(d) below, the Contingent Payment based on the Estimated EBITDA Amount.
If, within such 30-day period, Agent shall give written notice to Parent
setting forth in reasonable detail any objection to the Estimated EBITDA
Amount, Parent and Agent shall endeavor to reach agreement within the 30-day
period following the receipt by Parent of the notice of objection. If the
parties shall reach agreement on the objections of Agent, then the Estimated
EBITDA Amount as adjusted by the parties shall become Contingent Payment
EBITDA for purposes of this Agreement and Parent shall immediately deposit
into the Escrow Account and pay to Agent for the benefit of Company Members,
as provided in Section 2.3(d) below, the Contingent Payment as calculated
based on such Contingent Payment EBITDA. If the parties are unable to reach
agreement within such 30-day period, then the matter shall be submitted as
soon as practicable to the Independent Accountants for determination of
Contingent Payment EBITDA, in which case the determination of the Independent
Accountants shall be final and binding on the parties and such amount shall
become Contingent Payment EBITDA for purposes of the remainder of this
Agreement, and Parent shall immediately deposit into the Escrow Account and
pay to Agent for the benefit of Company Members, as provided in
Section 2.3(d) below, the Contingent Payment. The parties (and their
professional advisors) shall cooperate with one another in furtherance of
determining Contingent Payment EBITDA, and the parties shall make their books
and records and personnel reasonably available, and Parent shall make the
work papers utilized by KPMG (provided the customary work paper access letter
utilized in the public accounting industry is executed and delivered to KPMG)
and shall make KPMG reasonably available, in furtherance of making
such determination. In connection with the resolution of any dispute,
each party shall pay its own fees and expenses, including, without
limitation, legal, accounting and consultant fees and expenses. If Contingent
Payment EBITDA as determined by the Independent Accountants is greater than
the Estimated EBITDA Amount, then the cost and expense of the
Independent Accountants shall be paid by Parent. If Contingent Payment EBITDA
as determined by the Independent Accountants is less than the Estimated
EBITDA Amount, then the cost and expense of the Independent Accountants shall
be shared equally by Parent and Company Members. Such payment shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts specified by Agent and Parent, as applicable.   

 (c) Parent hereby covenants and agrees that, except as provided in Section 1.3, during the period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing through the one year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Earnout Period"), Parent shall continue the operations of the Company as a separate incorporated subsidiary of Parent and shall conduct the Business and operations of the Company in good faith using all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company to meet the EBITDA Target. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Parent shall, during the Earnout Period, except as may otherwise be agreed upon in writing by Agent, (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the Companys Providers, Members, Provider and Member relationships and Material Agreements, (ii) make available to    ##### 

  

  

Exhibit 10.44  

the Company capital sufficient for the Companys working capital purposes and
other business needs and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts not to
reduce the geographical scope of the business of the Company. Parent further
agrees to deliver to Agent quarterly statements of Contingent Payment EBITDA
in a format mutually agreed upon by Parent and Agent. If Parent fails to
comply with the provisions of this Section 2.3(c), there shall be a dollar-
for-dollar adjustment with respect to any reduction in Contingent Payment
EBITDA caused by such failure by Parent.   

 (d) A portion of the Contingent Payment in an amount equal to $3,000,000 less the amount by which the Closing Book Value exceeds $21,000,000, if any, shall be deposited by Parent into the Escrow Account. The remainder of the Contingent Payment shall be paid to Agent for the benefit of Company Members.   

 Section 2.4 _True Up of Claims_. On and through the 15th-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "True Up Period"), Parent shall recalculate the Tax liabilities and the liabilities for Medical Costs of the Company, including, without limitation, incurred, but not reported claims ("IBNR") (collectively, "Claims") as of the Closing Date (considering the post-Closing experience of the Company related to such pre-Closing Claims). The Company will send to Agent within 60 days of the end of the True Up Period its computation as to the amount of Claims as of the Closing Date, together with its work papers used to compute the amount of Claims (the "True Up Report"). Within 30 days of receipt of the True Up Report (the "Review Period"), Agent will either accept the True Up Report or provide Company with written specific objections to such report. If Agent does not accept the True Up Report as presented, the parties shall submit the dispute to the Independent Accountant in accordance with Section 11.2 below, in which case the determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding on the parties. If Agent accepts the True Up Report as presented, then at the end of the Review Period, the True Up Report will be deemed final and binding on the parties. Within five Business Days after the True Up Report becomes final, Escrow Agent shall pay Parent the amount, if any, of Claims as set forth in the True Up Report in excess of the amount of Claims in the Closing Balance Sheet. Within five Business Days after the True Up Report becomes final, Parent shall deposit into the Escrow Account the amount, if any, by which the Claims in the Closing Balance Sheet exceed the amount of Claims in the True Up Report.

Any information obtained pursuant to this Section shall be kept confidential by Company Members, unless and only to the extent that disclosure is required by law, legal process or regulatory authority. After such five-year period, Parent and the Company may dispose of such information, books and records, provided that before such disposition, Parent and the Company shall give Agent the opportunity to take possession of such information, books and records.

Exhibit 10.44 

 (a) _Transfer Taxes_. All documentary or other similar taxes, charges or fees imposed by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger shall be borne by Company Members.   

 (b) _Apportionment; Preparation of Tax Returns_. The Taxes shall be apportioned based, in the case of real, franchise, intangible and personal property Taxes, on a per diem basis, and, in the case of other Taxes (including, without limitation, Income Taxes), on the actual activities, taxable income or loss of during the applicable periods based on a closing of the books at the end of the Closing Date. Parent shall cause the Company to prepare and file all Tax Returns for the Company that are due for periods ending after the Effective Time. Agent shall have the right to review and approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, any Tax Returns, other than a consolidated return of Parent and its Affiliates, that include a Pre-Closing Partial Period for which Company Members may be liable for Taxes. If a Pre-Closing Partial Period is included in a consolidated return of Parent and its Affiliates, Parent shall give Agent reasonable information and access to necessary books and records to verify Company Members liability for Taxes for such Pre-Closing Partial Period.   

 (c) _Mutual Cooperation_. As soon as practicable, Parent shall deliver to Agent, such information and other data relating to Tax Returns and Taxes of the Company and shall provide such other assistance as may reasonably be requested, to cause the completion and filing of all Tax Returns for periods ending before the Effective Date or to respond to audits by any taxing authorities with respect to any Tax Returns or taxable periods or to otherwise enable Company Members, Parent and the Company to satisfy their accounting or Tax requirements. Any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.4(c) shall be kept confidential by the parties, unless and only to the extent that disclosure is required by law, legal process or regulatory authority.   

 (d) _Consent_. Whenever any taxing authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Company Taxes for any pre-Effective Date period, Parent shall promptly inform Agent. However, if Parent does not give prompt notice to Company Members, Company Members shall not be relieved of liability unless Parents delay materially prejudices the Companys or Company Members liability. If the Taxes in controversy relate solely to the periods before the Effective Time, Agent shall have the right to control any resulting proceedings and, with Parent approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld, to determine whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute, to the extent such proceedings or determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which Company Members may be liable under this Agreement. In all other matters, Parent shall have the right to control any resulting proceedings and, with input from Agent to the extent Taxes for which Company Members may be liable under this Agreement are at issue, to determine whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute to the extent such proceedings or determinations affect the amount of Taxes for which Company Members may be liable under this Agreement.   

 Section 6.5 _Audited Financial Information_. Company Members acknowledge that Parent is a reporting company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and/or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange    #####

Act"). Parent may file or include in its filings with the SEC (the
"Securities Filings") the "Financial Statements" for the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis including the Form 8-K due within 75
days after the Closing Date.   

 Section 6.6 _Publicity_. On execution of this Agreement and before Closing, Buyer and/or Parent will issue press releases with prior written notice to the Company. On and after Closing, Parent may issue press releases without any notice to the Company. Neither Company Members nor the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue any press release or any other public statement or any correspondence or other communication with respect to the execution and the Closing of this Agreement unless Buyer shall have had the prior opportunity to review and comment thereon and such release or statement has been consented to by Buyer. The Company acknowledges Parents reporting and disclosure obligations under the Exchange Act, other federal and state securities laws and case interpretations of such laws, whether as reported in its Securities Filings or in its everyday discussions with securities analysts, shareholders and the press. Company Members and the Company hereby consent to Buyers and Parents dissemination of such information in statements other than press releases.

 (a) The Company and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in good faith in obtaining, as promptly as practicable (i) all required consents of Governmental Entities; (ii) consents of all other third parties necessary to consummate the Transaction; and (iii) as necessary, all consents of Payors and other third parties under the Material Agreements to the change of control of the Company. In this regard, the Company shall assist in coordinating (and attend, at the Companys option) Buyers meetings and telephone conferences with Providers, applicable Governmental Entities, Payors and local community and trade organizations.   

 (b) Buyer and the Company shall take all actions necessary to file, as soon as practicable, all notifications, filings and other documents required to be filed by such party with all Governmental Entities, and obtain all other authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers, and to respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from any Governmental Entity for additional information or documentation in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties will file (and the Company will file, and the filing fees shall be shared 50% by Company Members and 50% by Buyer pursuant to Section 11.12(c)) any Notification and Report Forms and related material that it may be required to file with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act, will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain (and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain) a waiver from the applicable waiting period, and will make any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or advisable in connection therewith.   

 (c) The Company and Buyer shall (i) promptly advise each other on receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity or other Person whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the Transaction which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Required Consent will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such Required Consent will be materially delayed and (ii) promptly advise each other of the    ##### 

  

  

Exhibit 10.44  

occurrence or failure to occur of an event that would, or, with the lapse
of time would, cause any condition to the consummation of the
Transaction contemplated hereby not to be satisfied.

 (ii) as coordinated by the Companys President, grant Buyer access to and help Buyer interface with the phone information network used by the Company in connection with the Business and make available to Buyer, in all media reasonably available, such information as may prepare the Company to continue to pay claims arising under the Provider Contracts after the Closing Date and otherwise operate the Business.   

 Section 6.8 _Regulatory Filings_. The Company shall make all filings due on or before the Closing Date with Governmental Entities in accordance with the Companys usual business practices, and will give Buyer advance copies of the proposed filings so that Buyer will be able to give the Company its comments on the proposed filings.   

 Section 6.9 _Further Assurances_. Each party agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the Transaction.   

 Section 6.10 _Conditions_. Buyer, Parent, the Company and Company Members covenant and agree that, subject to the provisions of Article IX hereof, if any event should occur, either within or without the control of any party hereto, that would prevent fulfillment of the conditions of any party to consummate the Transaction, the parties shall each use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure the event as expeditiously as possible; _provided, however_ , that upon the occurrence of such event, no party shall have any obligation to take any action not specifically required by the terms of this Agreement to cure such event if such action would be unduly burdensome or would have a Material Adverse Effect on such party.   

 Section 6.11 _Revised Company Disclosure Schedule_. The Company shall deliver to Buyer a revised Company Disclosure Schedule if required to reflect changes in the Company Disclosure Schedule arising between the execution of this Agreement and the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that, except for changes that are permitted by the terms of this Agreement, no change in the Company Disclosure Schedule will be binding on Buyer without its prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.    ##### 

  

 

Exhibit 10.44 

 Section 6.12 _New Contracts_. Except in the case of the Provider Contracts terminable at will on notice of 90 days or less, Contracts (other than Material Agreements) entered into in the ordinary course of business, the replacement of employees on similar terms and conditions of employment, and the renewal of existing Contracts in the ordinary course of business, any new Material Agreements to be executed after the date of this Agreement on behalf of the Company which will not expire on or before the Closing Date shall require the prior written approval of a designated representative of Buyer, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.   

 Section 6.13 _No Solicitation_. During the Interim Period, neither Company Members nor the Company nor their respective managers, officers, employees, advisors and representatives shall, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any Acquisition Proposal from any Person, or engage in or continue discussions or negotiations relating to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall direct its managers, officers, financial advisors and other authorized representatives to refrain from taking any such action. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, with respect to the Company and the Business, any proposal or offer for, or any written statement of intention (by public announcement or otherwise) by any Person or group to effect, any merger or consolidation with, or acquisition of substantially all of the equity interests or assets of, or other business combination involving, the Company or the Business. The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and the Company shall immediately demand that any such persons return to the Company any confidential information and/or materials such persons may have received from the Company during the course of such activities, discussions or negotiations. Company Members and the Company acknowledge and agree that any remedy at law for breach of the foregoing covenants shall be inadequate, and in addition to any other relief which may be available, Buyer shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages, posting bond or providing security, and without regard to the adequacy of any remedy at law.   

 Section 6.14 _Collection of Receivables, Other Assets_. After the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the Receivables in the ordinary course of business, which efforts shall not include a requirement to pay any attorneys fees or out of pocket costs to third parties. If the Company shall not have collected the amount of Receivables, net of any reserve for bad debt, set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet by the 120th day after the Effective Time, Parent at its option, may assign such uncollected Receivables to Agent for the benefit of Company Members and Agent shall cause Escrow Agent to distribute from the Escrow Account to the Company the difference between the amount of Receivables, net of any reserve for bad debts, on the Closing Balance Sheet, and the amount of Receivables collected by the Company after Closing.

 (a) Except as provided in Section 7.1(c) and 7.1(d), neither Company Members nor the Company shall make any commitments to any of the Companys officers or employees with respect to their continued employment after the Effective Time. As coordinated by the Companys transition officer and/or President, the Company shall, upon Buyers request, permit Buyer to interview the Companys employees. The Company shall be responsible to pay on or before Closing Date all stay for pay, retention and severance payment which Company is obligated to pay to Companys employees prior to the Closing.

 (i) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, Company Members, individually and only to the extent of their respective individual obligations hereunder, agree to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer, Parent and their officers, directors, agents, Affiliates, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, harmless from and in respect of any and all losses, damages, costs and reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and defense fees and disbursements of counsel and other professionals) (individually a "Loss" and collectively, "Losses") that they may incur arising out of or due to (A) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by such Company Member and contained in Article III of this Agreement, or (B) any breach of a covenant of such Company Member contained in this Agreement. Company Members shall be entitled to any refunds of    ##### 

  

 

Exhibit 10.44   

such Taxes (including interest) with respect to the pre-Closing Date periods
except to the extent that such refund of Taxes is reflected as an asset on
the Closing Balance Sheet. The representations, warranties, indemnifications
and covenants of Company Members set forth in Article III, this Section
8.1(a)(i) and certain other provisions in this Merger Agreement are
duplicated in the Support Agreement because some Company Members may not be
Signing Members. There is no intent to increase the liability of any Signing
Members by including such provisions in both documents and no Signing
Members liability for such provisions shall increase as a
result thereof.   

 (ii) Except for the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of a Company Member for which such Company Member is individually liable under Section 8.1(a)(i), Company Members severally agree to indemnify, defend and hold Buyer, its officers, directors, agents and Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns, harmless from and in respect of any and all Losses (which shall include, for purposes of this Section 8.1(a)(ii), prospective rate adjustments by a Payor in lieu of a claim which would be subject to this Section 8.1(a)(ii)) that they may incur (A) arising out of or due to any breach of representation, warranty, covenant, undertaking or other agreement of the Company or Company Members, under this Agreement as of the Effective Time, (B) arising out of any claims by Dissenting Members relating to the Merger (including but not limited to claims in excess of Dissenters Allocable Consideration, claims challenging the Merger process, or claims relating to indemnification obligations, or (C) arising of out those matters disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule related to or arising out of or in connection with the Assets, business operations, conduct, products and/or employees (including former employees) of the Company in connection with the operations of the Company or the Business on or before the Closing Date except those Losses which are reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet, but only to the extent of such reserves. Parents exclusive source of recovery of amounts due on account of Losses pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(ii)(A) and 8.1(a)(i)(C) shall be through access to funds in the Escrow Account, Parents exclusive source of recovery of amounts due on account of Losses pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(ii)(B) shall be through access to funds in the Dissenters Account established under the Escrow Agreement; provided, nevertheless, that no claim asserted by Parent or Buyer shall paid from funds deposited into the Escrow Account in excess of the first $11,000,000 of such deposits exclusive of Dissenters Withhold Amount deposited to the Escrow Account by Agent, Parent, Buyer, Company Member or Company which excess will not be subject to Parent or Buyer claims for any reason.   

 (b) _Indemnification of Company Members and the Company_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, Buyer and Parent agree to indemnify, defend and hold Company Members, and before the Closing Date, the Company, and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members, agents and Affiliates, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, harmless from and in respect of any and all Losses that they may incur (i) arising out of or due to any inaccuracy of any representation or the breach of any warranty, covenant, undertaking or other agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (ii) related to or arising out of or in connection with the assets, business, operations, conduct, products and/or employees of the Company or the Business after the Closing Date, and (iii) all Taxes of the Company or any successor accruing on or after the Effective Date. Parent shall be entitled to any refunds of Taxes (including interest) accruing on or after the Effective Date and any Taxes (and interest thereon) receivable included in computing Closing Book Value.    ##### 

  

 

Exhibit 10.44 

 Section 8.2 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties and covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing through and including the Survival Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that Dissenting Member Claims and those representations and warranties and indemnities with respect to a Tax matter, an environmental matter, Benefit Plan matter, or a title matter (collectively, "Superior Claims") may be asserted at any time on or before the expiration of the limitations period under applicable law. If Loss under this Agreement is asserted by any party before the Survival Date, or in the case of Superior Claims, before the expiration of the applicable limitations period, such Loss shall survive until the existence of such Loss has been finally established and the Loss is resolved as provided below. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, no party shall be entitled to recover from any other for any Losses asserted against it pursuant to this Agreement (i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses of such party exceeds Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) and then for all such Losses and all further Losses or (ii) other than Section 8.1(a)(i) Losses and as provided in the Support Agreement, to the extent the aggregate amount of all Losses exceeds the funds available in the Escrow Account.   

 Section 8.3 _Notice and Opportunity to Defend_. If an event occurs which a party asserts would give rise to any indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 8.1, the party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnitee") shall promptly give written notice thereof to the other party obligated to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party"). If such event involves (i) any claim or (ii) the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third Person (collectively, the "Asserted Liability"), the Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party prompt written notice of such claim or the commencement of such action or proceeding describing the Asserted Liability in reasonable detail and indicating the amount (estimated, if necessary) for which such party may be liable; _provided, however_ , that the failure to provide prompt written notice as provided herein will relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder only to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder. For matters not involving a third party claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30 days after receipt of the Indemnitees notice to give written notice to the Indemnitees announcing its intent to contest the assertion of the Indemnitees (the "Contest Notice"). If a Contest Notice is not provided within such period, such assertion of the Indemnitees shall be deemed accepted and the amount of the Losses shall be deemed established. If a Contest Notice is provided, the contested assertion shall be resolved through binding arbitration as provided in Section 11.2. For matters involving third party claims, the amount of the Losses shall not be deemed established until the claim has been resolved with the third party as provided in Sections 8.3(a) and (b) below.   

 (a) _Provider Contracts, Current Employee or Payor Matters_. If an action is brought against the Company with respect to a Provider Contract, a current employee (as of the Closing Date) of the Company or a Payor, Parent shall defend the action. Agent shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such Asserted Liability provided that Parent in all instances shall be responsible for directing and controlling the settlement of, or defense against, such action. Parent may settle, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability in the exercise of its reasonable discretion at the expense of Company Members and Agent shall promptly reimburse Parent for the amount of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by    ##### 

  

 

Exhibit 10.44   

Parent in connection with the settlement of or defense against the Asserted
Liability to the extent and as provided in Section 8.1(a), including its
selection of counsel; _provided, however,_ that if Parent settles an action
related to a Provider dispute over the objection of Agent, Parent will pay
Agent for the benefit of Company Members 25% of the difference between the
amount at which Agent reasonably believes the matter could be timely settled
and the actual settlement amount. If no settlement of the Asserted Liability
is entered into, Escrow Agent shall promptly reimburse Parent for the amount
of any judgment rendered with respect to such Asserted Liability and all
related, bona fide and reasonable expenses incurred by Parent in defense
against such action to the extent recoverable under Section 8.1(a).   

 (b) _Superior Claim Matters; and other Indemnification Matters_. If any action either (i) is related to a Superior Claim Matter or (ii) for which Parent would be the Indemnifying Party, is brought against the Indemnitee and it notifies the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall, upon providing prompt written notification thereof within three days of receipt of any notice to the Indemnitee, be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee of such election to so assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof and the Indemnitee agrees to cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense against any such Asserted Liability. The Indemnitee shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such Asserted Liability provided that the Indemnifying Party in all instances shall be responsible for directing and controlling the settlement of, or defense against, such action. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to undertake to settle or defend against the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election as herein provided, or does not accept its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement, the Indemnitee may settle, compromise or defend such Asserted Liability in the exercise of its exclusive discretion at the expense of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee for the amount of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the settlement of or defense against the Asserted Liability to the extent provided in Section 8.1(a) or 8.1(b), as the case may be, including its selection of counsel. If no settlement of the Asserted Liability is entered into, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnitee for the amount of any judgment rendered with respect to such Asserted Liability and all related, bona fide and reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in defense against such action to the extent recoverable under Section 8.1(a) or 8.1(b) as the case may be. Except as specified herein, in no event shall an Indemnifying Party be liable for any settlement effected without its consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.   

 (c) _Other Matters_. Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnitee shall, in the defense of any Asserted Liability, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement agreement, except with the written consent of the other party, which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to both the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party of a release from all liability in respect of such Asserted Liability. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee shall each use all commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in connection with the settlement of, or the defense against, any    ##### 

  

 

Exhibit 10.44   

Asserted Liability and make available to the other all books, records and
other documents within its control that are reasonably necessary or
appropriate for such defense. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement the Indemnitee shall have the right to pay or settle at any time
any Asserted Liability, provided that (as a result thereof, and except where
the Indemnifying Party elects not to undertake to settle or defend against
the Asserted Liability, fails to notify the Indemnitee of its election, or
does not accept its obligation to indemnify under this Agreement) the
Indemnitee shall also be deemed to have waived any right to
indemnification therefore by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in any Transaction document, all claims against
Company Members and/or the Company for breach of representations, warranties
or covenants under any of the Transaction Documents shall be asserted, if at
all, exclusively as claims for indemnity under this Article VIII, regardless
of whether the claim is stated as a breach of representation, warranty or
covenant or otherwise.   

 Section 8.4 _Payment of Losses_. The Indemnifying Party hereby agrees to pay the amount of established Losses within 30 days after the establishment thereof. The amount of established Losses shall be paid in cash or, as applicable, from the Escrow Account. Any amounts not paid by the Indemnifying Party when due under this Section shall bear interest from and after the due date thereof until the date paid at a rate equal to the lesser of: (a) 12% per annum and (b) the highest legal rate permitted by applicable law.

Exhibit 10.44 

ARTICLE XI 
 MISCELLANEOUS    

 Section 11.1 _Governing Law and Consent to Jurisdiction_.   

 (a) This Agreement will be governed in all respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the State of New York (irrespective of its choice of law principles) applicable to contracts executed and to be performed wholly within such state.   

 (b) Subject to the arbitration provisions of Section 11.2 below, each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, specifically the Supreme Court of the County of New York (and the courts having jurisdiction over appeals therefrom) in respect of the Transaction, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat the jurisdiction of such courts by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) waives any claim that such proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum, and (iv) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement in any court other than a New York state court, located in the County of New York.   

 Section 11.2 _Dispute Resolution_.   

 (a) _Agreement to Arbitrate_. Except as provided in Sections 2.2(d), 2.2(e) and 2.3(b), and except where injunctive relief is reasonably necessary to prevent immediate damage to the aggrieved party, in a dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement, the parties agree to utilize the arbitration procedure specified in this Section; _provided, however,_ that in the event of a purported breach of the Agreement, the injured party shall provide notice to the breaching party and allow a period of 20 days to cure the breach prior to initiating arbitration   

 (b) _Initial Notice; Attempted Settlement_. A party seeking to initiate an arbitration proceeding shall give written notice (the "Initial Notice") to the other party describing briefly the nature of its dispute and its claim and identifying an individual with authority to settle such dispute on its behalf (the "Settlement Agent"). The party receiving such notice shall have ten (10) days within which to designate its own Settlement Agent. The Settlement Agents shall make such investigations as they deem appropriate and thereafter promptly shall commence discussions concerning resolution of such dispute.   

 (c) _Selection of Arbitrator_. If the dispute has not been resolved within the later of (i) 15 days from the date of designation of a Settlement Agent by the party receiving the Initial Notice or (ii) 25 days from the giving of the Initial Notice, it shall be submitted to a panel of arbitrators (the "Arbitrators"), one chosen by each of the parties. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitrators shall hold a hearing in New York, New York pursuant to the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") within 30 days after their selection by the parties, in advance of which the parties shall submit whatever information they deem appropriate to the Arbitrators for review. The Arbitrators may allow discovery on such terms as the Arbitrators determine necessary or appropriate for a proper decision. At the hearing held by the Arbitrators, each party shall have the opportunity to present its position with respect to the dispute. The Arbitrators shall thereafter render their opinion within 15 days of such hearing. If the two Arbitrators cannot reach a decision, they shall mutually pick a third arbitrator who shall resolve the dispute.    ##### 

  

 

Exhibit 10.44 

 (d) _Cure of Breach_. For purposes of this Section, if a dispute is based on the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or any other agreement contained herein, and such breach is cured to the actual knowledge of the party giving the Initial Notice within 15 days from the date of designation of a Settlement Agent by the party receiving the Initial Notice, the party giving the Initial Notice shall withdraw or shall be liable for the costs of any arbitration that results in a finding that such cure has occurred.   

 (e) _Arbitrators  Award_. The opinions and recommendations of the Arbitrators shall be binding on the parties and judgment upon the award rendered by the Arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided, however, that expenses and attorney fees may only be awarded to a party upon a finding of bad faith by the other party. In no event may the Arbitrators award exceed the limits of liability set forth in Article VIII.   

 Section 11.3 _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects only by written agreement of the parties at any time before the Closing Date with respect to any of the terms contained herein.   

 Section 11.4 _Notices_. All notices, consents and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) on the Business Day (or the next succeeding Business Day if the date of delivery is not a Business Day) when delivered by hand or by Federal Express, UPS or a similar commercial overnight courier with provisions for a receipt; (b) five days after being deposited in any United States Post Office postage prepaid, registered or certified mail; or (c) on the Business Day (or the next succeeding Business Day if the date of delivery is not a Business Day) when successfully transmitted by telecopier (with a confirming copy of such communication to be sent as provided in clauses (a) or (b) above), to the receiving party at the address or telecopier number set forth below (or at such other address or telecopier number for a party as shall be specified by like notice); _provided, however_ that any notice of change of address or telecopier number shall be effective only upon receipt:

Exhibit 10.44  

 Section 11.5 _Interpretation_.   

 (a) The words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and references to article, section, paragraph, exhibit and schedule are to the articles, sections, paragraphs, exhibits and schedules of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. The words describing the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa, and words denoting any genders shall include all genders. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.   

 (b) The Company Disclosure Schedule and the other schedules hereto shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Any matter disclosed pursuant to any schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed for the purpose indicated on such schedule, but such disclosure shall not be deemed to be an admission or representation as to the materiality of the item so disclosed.   

 (c) Headings are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever.   

 Section 11.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall together be considered one and the same agreement.    

 Section 11.7 _Entire Agreements; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the Schedules hereto, and the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement (i) constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior negotiations, discussions, disclosures, representations and warranties, agreements and understandings, if any, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (ii) except as specifically provided herein, is not intended to nor shall it confer, upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns any rights, benefits, claims, or remedies hereunder.   

 Section 11.8 _Partial Invalidity_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, this Agreement shall be construed as if such illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained in this Agreement unless the deletion of such provision or provisions would result in such a material change as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated hereby to be unreasonable.    ##### 

  

   

Exhibit 10.44 

 Section 11.9 _Service of Process_. Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in Section 11.1 hereof in any such action or proceeding by having copies thereof mailed by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to Section 11.4 hereof. However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available method.   

 Section 11.10 _Specific Performance_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement each non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties will (a) waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law, and (b) be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific performance of this Agreement in any action instituted in accordance with Section 11.2.   

 Section 11.11 _Assignment; Binding Agreement_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by either party (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.   

 Section 11.12 _Expenses_.   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated.   

 (b) The Company shall be responsible for all costs and expenses associated with all Provider and Member communications and materials sent by either the Company or Buyer, which costs and expense shall be paid before the Closing or appropriately reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet. Company Members shall be responsible for all legal expenses of Company Members incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all costs associated with the Companys obligation to pay Banc of America Securities for underwriting and investment services.   

 (c) The filing fees required under the HSR Act shall be shared 50% by Company Members and 50% by Buyer, and Agent shall deduct Company Members share from the Closing Cash Amount at Closing.   

 Section 11.13 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of either party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.    ##### 

  

 

Exhibit 10.44  

 Section 11.14 _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such party has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this Agreement.
