 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 3.1(f)_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ and any Appraisal Shares) shall be converted automatically at the Effective Time into the right to receive 0.40035 shares of common stock of the Parent (the " _Stock Exchange Ratio_ "), par value $1.00 per share (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") and $2.69 in cash (the " _Cash Portion_ ", and together with the Stock Exchange Ratio, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

   #####

 (c) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall be changed or proposed to be changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of the occurrence of or record date with respect to any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar readjustment, in any such case within such period, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Merger Consideration. Nothing in this _Section 3.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) _Treatment of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and no cash, Parent Common Stock, or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (e) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made having a record date after the Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration represented thereby until the holder of record of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share has surrendered such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with _Section 3.3_. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws (including escheat and abandoned property laws), following surrender of any such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, in addition to the applicable Merger Consideration, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the Merger Consideration, and (ii) if the payment date for any dividend or distribution payable with respect to the Merger Consideration has not occurred prior to the surrender of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share, at the appropriate payment date therefor, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the surrender of such Stock Certificate and a payment date subsequent to the surrender of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share.

 SECTION 3.2 _Appraisal Rights_. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any record holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to  _Section 3.1_, but instead at the Effective Time shall become the right to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL and at the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Appraisal Shares and (ii) the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited and cease and if such forfeiture shall occur following the Effective Time, each such Appraisal Share shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock (provided that the failure of the Company to deliver such prompt notice shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement) and the Company shall provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

  

 SECTION 3.3 _Surrender and Payment_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall authorize one or more transfer agent(s) reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ through the Exchange Agent, the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration in exchange for surrendered shares 

   ##### 

  

    

of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange Fund.
Except as contemplated by _Section 3.3(d)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) each Stock Certificate and (ii) any Book Entry Shares, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent or in the case of Book Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section 3.1(a)_. Exchange of any Book Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Exchange Agents customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry. Upon surrender of a Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (y) a check in the amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and this  _Article III_, including cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ and dividends and other distributions pursuant to  _Section 3.1(e)_, and the Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make all payments required pursuant to the preceding sentence as soon as practicable following the valid surrender of Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Stock Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Stock Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Entity that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b)_, each Stock Certificate and Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional shares to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_, without any interest thereon. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Transfer Books_. All Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender of Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Entitys obligation to pay any dividends and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock entitled thereto, sufficient cash or immediately available funds to make the payments contemplated in the preceding sentence. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional shares to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six (6) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed by holders of Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares (other than Appraisal Shares), and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Entity (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof to exchange such Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares or to pay amounts to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ upon due surrender of their Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any payment pursuant to this  _Article III_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in _Section 4.3(c)_), the Merger Consideration and other amounts payable under this _Article III_ in respect of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Stock Certificates evidencing Company Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue to such holder the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Stock Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to 

   ##### 

  

    

 _Section 3.1(f)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to  _Section 3.1(e)_, in each case,
without any interest thereon, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Stock Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof and, if required by Parent, the posting by such holder of
a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Stock
Certificates, with such assurances as the Exchange Agent, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration,
may reasonably require of the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock
Certificates. 

  

 (f) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement any stock transfer taxes and such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. 

  

 (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Entity pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_. The parties hereto agree that, for United States federal income tax reporting purposes, the Surviving Entity shall be the owner of the Exchange Fund. If for any reason (including losses) the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under this _Article III_, Parent shall take all steps necessary to promptly, or to enable or cause the Surviving Entity to promptly, deposit with the Exchange Agent additional Merger Consideration or other cash sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Entity shall in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Surviving Entity shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (h) _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

  

 SECTION 3.4 _Treatment of Options and other Equity Awards_. 

  

 (a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") granted under the BJ Services Company 1995 Incentive Plan, the BJ Services Company 1997 Incentive Plan, the BJ Services Company 2000 Incentive Plan and the BJ Services Company 2003 Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the 

   ##### 

  

    

Effective Time, shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a stock
right (an " _Adjusted Stock Right_ ") to acquire Parent Common Stock
in accordance with this _Section 3.4(a)_. Each such Adjusted Stock Right as
so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that as of the Effective Time, the Company
Option as so assumed and converted shall be fully vested and shall
be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
multiplied by (y) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock of such Company Option by (b) the Stock Award Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ that the exercise price and/or the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that may be purchased under the Adjusted Stock Right shall
be further adjusted to the extent required to remain compliant, or exempt
from, with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the Department of
Treasury Regulations issued thereunder (collectively, " _Section 409A_");
and provided further, that in the case of Company Options that are intended
to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of
the Code, the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to the Adjusted Stock Right shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and the
Department of Treasury Regulations issued thereunder. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Stock Award Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum of the Stock
Exchange Ratio and the Cash Portion Exchange Ratio. The " _Cash Portion
Exchange Ratio_ " means the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Cash
Portion by (ii) the Market Price. 

  

 (b) As of the Effective Time, the performance goals under any then outstanding Performance Unit Awards (the " _Company Performance Units_ ") granted under Company Stock Plans shall be deemed to have been achieved at the expected value level of performance, and each such Company Performance Unit shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, be treated as an unrestricted share of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and each such share of Company Common Stock shall be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and shall afford the same rights and shall be subject to the same conditions, as each share of Company Common Stock not subject to any restrictions; provided, that the Company Performance Units shall otherwise continue to be subject to the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plans and award agreements, including the right to receive any cash bonus provided for in the holders award agreement (subject to applicable tax withholding requirements). 

  

 (c) As of the Effective Time, all remaining restrictions on each Company Phantom Stock Award (the " _Company Phantom Stock_ ") granted and then outstanding under Company Stock Plans shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, lapse and each such share of Company Phantom Stock shall be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and shall afford the same rights and shall be subject to the same conditions, as each share of Company Common Stock not subject to restrictions; provided, that the Company Phantom Stock shall otherwise continue to be subject to the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plans and award agreements, including the right to receive 

   ##### 

  

    

any cash bonus provided for in the holders award agreement (subject to
applicable tax withholding requirements). 

  

 (d) On or prior to September 30, 2009, the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to amend the BJ Services Company 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") to provide that if the Company shall not be the surviving corporation in any merger (or survives only as a subsidiary of another entity) (as defined in the ESPP) that occurs prior to the last day of an Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP), there shall be no purchases of stock of the Company or of any other entity for such Offering Period and the ESPP option holders accumulated payroll deductions for such Offering Period shall be returned to the ESPP option holders without interest. 

  

 (e) As of the Effective Time, _provided_ that the Effective Time is prior to January 1, 2010, the performance goals under any then outstanding Bonus Stock (as defined in the Company Stock Plans) (the " _Company Bonus Stock_ ") granted under Company Stock Plans shall be deemed to have been achieved in full, and each such share of Company Bonus Stock shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, be treated as an unrestricted share of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and each such share of Company Common Stock shall be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and shall afford the same rights and shall be subject to the same conditions, as each share of Company Common Stock not subject to any restrictions; _provided_ , that the Company Bonus Stock shall otherwise continue to be subject to the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plans and award agreements, including the right to receive any cash bonus provided for in the holders award agreement (subject to applicable tax withholding requirements).

Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company Stock Plans shall be amended, to the extent necessary, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.4_, including the conversion of the Company Options and the substitution of Parent for the Company thereunder to the extent appropriate to effectuate the assumption of such Company Stock Plans by Parent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) Parent shall take all action necessary or appropriate to have available for issuance under an effective registration statement filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise or vesting of the Adjusted Stock Rights and the outstanding Company Performance Unit and Company Phantom Stock. 

  

 (i) As of the Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 3.4_, all rights under any Company Option and any provision of the Company Stock Plans providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall be cancelled. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that, as of and after the Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 3.4_, no Person shall have any rights under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement with respect to securities of the Company, the Surviving Entity or any Subsidiary thereof.

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.11(a)_, the Company and its Representatives shall be entitled, prior to obtaining the Required Company Vote, to furnish information regarding the Company and any Company Subsidiary to, or engage in discussions 

   #####

Representatives of the Company Subsidiaries shall have breached the

have determined, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with the
Companys financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as
hereinafter defined); _provided_ that the Company may not enter
into negotiations or discussions or supply any information in connection with
an Alternative Proposal without entering into a confidentiality agreement at
least as restrictive in all matters as the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
as of July 2, 2009 between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") except that such confidentiality agreement may allow such
third party to make Alternative Proposals to the Company in connection with
the negotiations and discussions permitted by this _Section 7.11(b)_. Parent
shall be entitled to receive an executed copy of any such confidentiality
agreement and notification of the identity of such Person immediately after
the Companys entering into such discussions or negotiations or

Representatives. The Company shall promptly provide or make available to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company and any Company
Subsidiary that is provided to the Person making such Alternative Proposal or
its Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to
Parent. The Company agrees that it shall notify Parent promptly if any
inquiry, contact or proposal related to an Alternative Proposal is received

of the Company Subsidiaries, and thereafter shall keep Parent informed in
writing, on a reasonably current basis, regarding the status of any such
inquiry, contact or proposal and the status of any such negotiations or
discussions. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of
the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with
respect to an Alternative Proposal or from making any similar disclosure,
_provided_ , _however_ , that subject to _Section 7.11(c)_ , neither the
Company nor the Board of the Company shall withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, its position with respect to this Agreement or
in connection with the Merger, or approve (other than in connection with a
termination under  _Section 9.3(b)_) or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, an Alternative Proposal. 

   

 (c) The Board of the Company shall not withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or resolve to or publicly propose to withdraw, amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation or fail to make the Company Board Recommendation (any such action, a " _Change in Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, prior to receipt of the Required Company Vote, the Board of the Company may effect a Change in Recommendation if (i) the Board of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that its failure to take such action would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, (ii) the Board of the Company provides Parent with at least three (3)

in Recommendation and specifying the material events giving rise thereto, and

modifications to the terms of this Agreement).

 (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any Alternative Proposal (A) which provides that 100% of the Companys outstanding equity securities shall be converted into, exchanged for or otherwise cancelled in exchange for the right to receive consideration that does not constitute 50% or more of the outstanding equity securities of the acquiring or surviving entity or its ultimate parent or (B) providing for the sale of all or substantially all of the Companys assets, in either case on terms which the Board of the Company determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and financial advisors, would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger (or any bona fide written offer or proposal made by Parent in response to such Alternative Proposal or otherwise), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal and this Agreement (including any conditions to and expected timing of consummation thereof, and all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such Alternative Proposal and this Agreement).

If for any reason the Company does not obtain and fully pay for such "tail" insurance policies prior to the Closing, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall maintain director and officer liability policies from a reputable and financially sound carrier through and including the date six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby) and such policies shall contain coverage that is at least as favorable to the Persons covered by such existing policies (a complete and accurate copy of which has been made available to Parent);  _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Entity be required to expend an amount pursuant to this _Section 7.12(b)_ in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage in the aggregate and if such comparable coverage cannot be obtained by paying an aggregate premium in excess of 300% of the current annual premium, the Surviving Entity shall only be required to maintain as much coverage as can be maintained by paying an aggregate premium equal to 300% of such amount. 

   

 (c) This _Section 7.12_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person (notwithstanding that such Persons are not parties to this Agreement) and their respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. If Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting from such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall assume the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section 7.12_. 

   

 (d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company and Company Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors, employees or agents or fiduciaries under any Company

the sale of all or substantially all of the Parents assets, in either case
on terms which the Board of Parent determines in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with Parents outside counsel and financial advisors,
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable from a
financial point of view to the holders of Parent Common Stock than the Merger
(or any bona fide written offer or proposal made by the Company in response
to such Alternative Proposal or otherwise), taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such Alternative Proposal and this Agreement (including any
conditions to and expected timing of consummation thereof, and all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of such Alternative Proposal and this
Agreement). 

  

 (b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of _Section 9.5(a)_ shall be made to Parent promptly following the earlier of the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, any transaction contemplated by the Alternative Proposal (and in any event not later than two (2) Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment); any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (ii) of _Section 9.5(a)_ shall be made to Parent concurrently with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_; any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (iii) of _Section 9.5(a)_ shall be made to Parent promptly following termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.4(c)_ (and in any event not later than two (2) Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment), and such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent.

   #####

for payment); any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (vi) of

designated by the Company. In circumstances where this  _Section 9.5_

 (d) Parent and the Company acknowledge that the fees, Expense reimbursement and the other provisions of this _Section 9.5_ are an integral part of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties agree that in circumstances where payment of the Termination Fee is required hereunder, upon such payment, the payment of any Termination Fee in accordance with this  _Section 9.5_, shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, for (i) any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and (ii) any other losses, damages, obligations or liabilities suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Upon payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 9.5_, none of the Company or Parent or any of their respective stockholders, partners, members, directors, Affiliates, officers or agents, as the case may be, shall have any 

   ##### 

  

    

further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (e) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Sections 9.1_ through  _9.4_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective Affiliates or Representatives, _provided_ that (i) _Sections 4.10_, _5.9_ , _7.10(b)_ and  _9.5_ will survive termination hereof and (ii) except as provided in _Section 9.5(d)_ , no party shall be relieved from any liabilities or damages as a result of any willful and material breach by any party of any of such partys representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 9.6 _Amendment_. 

  

 This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, at any time before or after approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by action by or on behalf of the respective Boards of Directors of the parties hereto or the stockholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such approval by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made without the further approval of such stockholders except as permitted by Law. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

 SECTION 9.7 _Waiver_. 

  

 Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived at any time prior to the Effective Time by any of the parties entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument signed by each such party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
