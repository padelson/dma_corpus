Parent shall cause to be prepared and filed with the SEC the Proxy/Prospectus in preliminary
form. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly obtain and furnish the
information concerning itself and its Affiliates required to be included in the Proxy/Prospectus.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to the
Proxy/Prospectus or the Registration Statement. Each party shall promptly notify the other party
upon the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC or its staff or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement and shall provide the other party with copies of all written correspondence and a
summary of all oral communications between it, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the
other hand, relating to the Proxy/Prospectus or the Registration Statement. Each party shall
cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
substantive correspondence (including responses to SEC comments), amendments or supplements to
the Proxy/Prospectus or the Registration Statement prior to filing with the SEC, and shall
provide to the other a copy of all such filings made with the SEC.

Proxy/Prospectus so long as Parent has provided to the Company a copy of the Registration
Statement containing the Proxy/Prospectus at least ten (10)&nbsp;days prior to any filing thereof and
any supplement or amendment at least two days prior to any filing thereof. Parent and the
Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do
business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to
service of process in any jurisdiction) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of shares of
Company capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.
Promptly after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, Parent and the Company shall
cause the Proxy/Prospectus to be mailed to their respective stockholders, and if necessary, after
the definitive Proxy/Prospectus has been mailed, promptly circulate amended, supplemented or
supplemental proxy materials and, if required in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies or
written consents, as applicable. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent or the Company discover any statement which, in light of the circumstances to
which it is made, is false or misleading with respect to a material fact or omits to state a
material fact necessary to make the statement made in the Proxy/Prospectus or
Registration Statement not misleading, then such party shall immediately notify the other
party of such misstatements or omissions. Parent shall advise the Company and the Company
