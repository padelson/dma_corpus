Buyer to Seller for the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities (the "

in cash.  The Base Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section 2.07
and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.09 (such
adjusted amount referred to herein as the " **Final Purchase Price** ").

        

Section 2.06. _Allocation of Purchase Price_ _. _(a) Schedule 2.06(a)
sets forth a statement delivered by Seller to Buyer (the " **Allocation
Statement** ") allocating the Base Purchase Price (plus Assumed Liabilities)
among the Acquired Assets (except for the Canadian Equipment, Canadian spare
parts referred to in Section 2.10 and Canadian Inventory) in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and applicable local law.  If within thirty (30)
days after the Effective Date, Buyer notifies Seller in writing that Buyer
objects to the allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Buyer and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute
within thirty (30) days. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such
dispute within thirty (30) days, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain
an Accounting Referee (as provided in Section 2.08(c)) to resolve the
disputed items. Upon resolution of the disputed items, the allocation
reflected on the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted to reflect such
resolution. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee in
connection with any dispute regarding the Allocation Statement shall be borne
equally by Buyer and Seller.

  

(b) Buyer and Seller agree to allocate an amount of the Base Purchase Price
to the Canadian Equipment, Canadian spare parts referred to in Section 2.10,
and Canadian Inventory in accordance with Schedule 2.06(b). The allocations
made on Schedule 2.06(b) are intended to be made in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and applicable law.

  

(c) If an adjustment is made with respect to the Base Purchase Price pursuant
to Section 2.09, such adjustment will be allocated solely to Inventory for
purposes of the Allocation Statement. Buyer and Seller agree to file any
additional information return required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060
of the Code and applicable local law and to treat the Allocation Statement as
adjusted to reflect such resolution.

  

(d) Neither Buyer nor Seller, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall
take any position for Tax purposes (including the filing of Form 8594 with
its federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the Closing
Date) that is inconsistent with the allocation of the Final Purchase Price
and Assumed Liabilities unless required to do so by Section 1060 of the Code
or other applicable local law. The Seller will provide any
information returns required by Section 1060 of the Code and any similar
state statute at least sixty (60) days prior to filing such returns. The
provisions of this Section 2.06 shall survive the Closing. The
Federal Employer Identification Number of each party to this Agreement is as
follows: Seller (36-3083135) and Buyer (20-8271107).

  

Section 2.07. _Closing. _The closing (the " **Closing** ") of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at 9:00 A.M. New
York time at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York on the first Business Day after the last day of the accounting
period of Seller

        

set forth on Schedule 2.07 during which all of the conditions set forth in
Article 8 have been satisfied (or to the extent permitted by law, waived);
_provided_ that in any event " **Closing Date** " shall mean 12:01 A.M. New
York time on the day immediately following the last day of such accounting
period. On the Closing Date:

  

(a) Buyer shall become unconditionally obligated to deliver to Seller, as
promptly as practicable on the first Business Day after the Closing Date, the
Base Purchase Price in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank
account designated in writing at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date by Seller;

  

(b) Seller and Buyer shall enter into, and exchange executed counterparts to,
the Assignment and Assumption Agreement;

  

(c) Kraft Food Holdings, Inc. and Buyer shall enter into, and exchange
executed counterparts to, the Trademark Assignment Agreement;

  

(d) Kraft Food Holdings, Inc. and Buyer shall enter into, and exchange
executed counterparts to, the Patent Application Assignment Agreement;

  

(e) Buyer shall deliver to Seller the form of purchase order to be used by
Buyer to order Products pursuant to the Co-Manufacturing Agreement, which
form of purchase order must be reasonably acceptable to Seller and shall, in
any event, provide that if there is any inconsistency between the terms of
such purchase order and the terms of the Co-Manufacturing Agreement, the
terms of the Co-Manufacturing Agreement shall govern;

  

(f) Seller shall deliver, or cause its Subsidiaries to deliver, to Buyer
specifications for the Products and for related raw materials, packaging
materials, packaging labels and product labels pursuant to the Co-
Manufacturing Agreement;

  

(g) Seller shall deliver, or cause its Subsidiaries to deliver, to Buyer or
its Subsidiaries such further bills of sale, endorsements, consents,
assignments and other good and sufficient instruments of conveyance and
assignment as the parties and their respective counsel shall deem reasonably
necessary under applicable law to vest in Buyer, all right, title and
interest in, to and under the Acquired Assets and to evidence Buyers,
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities;

  

(h) Buyer shall deliver to Seller the certificate specified in Section
8.02(c);

  

(i) Seller will deliver to Buyer the certificate specified
inSection 8.03(c); and

        

(j) Buyer and Seller shall enter into such other documents and instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

Section 2.08. _Closing Inventory Calculation. _(a) As soon
as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days following the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a report setting forth Sellers
calculation of the dollar amount of the Inventory as of the Closing Date (the
" **Closing Inventory Amount** ") prepared as described herein. The Closing
Inventory Amount and Final Inventory Amount shall be determined in accordance
with GAAP applied consistently with the Sellers internal management
accounting and quality control policies and shall be calculated without
giving effect to any changes or adjustments arising from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. Buyer shall
have the right to be present to observe and verify the taking of any
physical inventory in conjunction with the preparation of Sellers
calculation of the Closing Inventory Amount, and, at any time after Sellers
notice of its calculation of the Closing Inventory Amount but prior to the
determination of the Final Inventory Amount in accordance with this Section
2.08, may review and examine the procedures, books, records and work papers
of Seller relating to such calculation.

  

(b) If Buyer disagrees with Sellers calculation of the Closing Inventory
Amount delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(a), Buyer may, within thirty (30)
days following such delivery, notify Seller in writing that it objects to the
computation of said amount, specifying those items and amounts as to which
Buyer disagrees with a written explanation of the reasons for disagreement
with each such item and amount, and its alternative computation of each such
item and amount, and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all other
items and amounts contained in Sellers calculation of the Closing Inventory
Amount.  If Buyer fails to deliver such written notice within such 30-day
period, Sellers calculation of the Closing Inventory Amount shall be the
Final Inventory Amount, which shall be binding upon the parties.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.08 to the contrary, Buyer shall
not contest Sellers calculation of the Closing Inventory Amount if the
difference between their respective calculations of Closing Inventory Amount
is less than $100,000.

  

(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.08(b), Buyer and Seller shall, during the ten (10) Business Days following
such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement
on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, a
mutually agreed Closing Inventory Amount. If during such period or any
mutually agreed upon extension thereof, Buyer and Seller are unable to reach
such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter retain a nationally recognized
accounting firm which is reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller and which
has no material relationship with Buyer, Seller or their respective
Affiliates or other

        

material conflict (the " **Accounting Referee** ") to review this Section
2.08, the definitions for the terms used herein and the disputed items or
amounts for the purpose of promptly calculating Closing Inventory
Amount, which amount shall not be more than the amount thereof shown in
Sellers calculations delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(a) nor less than the
amount thereof shown in Buyers calculation delivered pursuant to
Section 2.08(b). Each party agrees to execute, if requested by the
Accounting Referee, a reasonable engagement letter. If Buyer and Seller do
not promptly agree on the selection of the Accounting Referee, which
shall occur no later than five (5) days after the end of the ten-day period
referred to above, then each shall select an independent accounting firm of
nationally recognized standing and such two independent accounting firms
shall jointly select the Accounting Referee pursuant to this Section 2.08(c).
In making its calculation in accordance with this Agreement, the Accounting
Referee will make its determination based solely on presentations by Seller
and Buyer and not by independent review and shall consider only those items
or amounts in Sellers calculation of the Closing Inventory Amount as to
which Buyer has disagreed. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Buyer and
Seller, as promptly as practicable, a written report setting forth
such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and
Seller. Buyer and Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Accounting Referee to render its decision as soon as reasonably
practicable, including by promptly complying with all reasonable requests by
the Accounting Referee for information, books, records and similar items.
 The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee in connection with
any dispute regarding the Closing Inventory Amount shall be
borne proportionately by Buyer and Seller to the extent that Buyers and
Sellers respective calculations of Closing Inventory Amount differ from the
Accounting Referees determination.

  

Section 2.09 _. Adjustment of Purchase Price. _(a) If the Final Inventory
Amount exceeds $1,800,000 (the " **Target Closing Inventory Amount** ") by
more than $100,000, Buyer shall pay to Seller, as an adjustment to the Base
Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section
2.09(b), the amount of such excess. If the Target Closing Inventory
Amount exceeds the Final Inventory Amount by more than $100,000, Seller shall
pay to Buyer, as an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price, in the manner and
with interest as provided in Section 2.09(b), the amount of such excess. The
" **Final Inventory Amount** " means the Closing Inventory Amount (i) as
shown in Sellers calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(a)if no
notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to
Section 2.08(b); or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A)
as agreed by Buyer and Seller pursuant to Section 2.08(c) or (B) in the
absence of such agreement, as shown in the Accounting Referees calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(c); _provided_ that in no event shall the
Final Inventory Amount be more than Sellers calculation of the Closing
Inventory Amount delivered pursuant to Section 2.08(a)

        

or less than Buyers calculation of the Closing Inventory Amount delivered
pursuant to Section 2.08(b).

  

(b) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.09(a) shall be made at a mutually
convenient time and place within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Inventory Amount has been determined by delivery by Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the other
party or by causing such payments to be credited to such account of such
other party as may be designated by such other party; _provided_ that if Buyer
shall have delivered a notice of disagreement pursuant to Section 2.08(b) and
either (i) Buyers and Sellers calculations of Closing Inventory Amount
would both require a payment by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.09(a) or (ii)
Buyers and Sellers calculations of Closing Inventory Amount would both
require a payment by Seller pursuant to Section 2.09(a) (although in each
case there is disagreement as to the amount of such payment), then Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, shall pay the lesser of the amounts that would be
payable pursuant to Section 2.09(a) based on their respective calculations of
Closing Inventory Amount within five (5) Business Days of the date such
notice of disagreement was delivered, and any such payment shall be credited
against the payment required by Section 2.09(a). The amount of any payments
to be made pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall bear interest from and
including the Closing Date but excluding the date of payment at the Prime
Rate in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to
the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the
payment to which it relates and shall be calculated on the basis of a year of
365 days and the actual number of days elapsed, compounded quarterly.

  

Section 2.10. _Purchase of Spare Parts_. Upon the expiration
or termination of the Co-Manufacturing Agreement, subject to the terms
thereof, Buyer shall purchase from Kraft Canada all of its right, title and
interest in and to the spare parts owned by Kraft Canada at such time that
are exclusively related to the Equipment for a payment of $1 in Canadian
currency.

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership and similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and to general
equitable principles.  Seller has performed, and each of its Affiliates that

conducted by Seller and its Affiliates and as conducted immediately prior to
the Closing Date.

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Seller nor
its Affiliates has received in the three-year period before the Closing Date
any written notice from any Governmental Authority regarding any actual
alleged or potential violation of, or failure to comply with any Legal

Section 3.17. _Product Liability; Product Recall. _Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.17, there are not pending and have not been since December 31,
2003, and to the Knowledge of the Seller there is no basis for, any claims of
defective design, failure to warn and or alleged breach of express or implied
warranty with respect to any Products and any other claim of personal injury

(a) For one year after the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates will not
(i) directly or indirectly solicit or seek to induce any employees of Seller
or any of its Affiliates with whom Buyer has come into contact during its
evaluation of the Business and the negotiation of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements before the Closing Date, including any salaried or
management personnel involved in the operation of the Business, to leave his
or her employment or position with Seller or any of its Affiliates or (ii)
hire any such individual who was an employee of Seller or any of
its Affiliates on or after the date hereof.

Buyer from: (i) soliciting or hiring any non-salaried employees involved in
the operation of the Business, (ii) soliciting or hiring any salaried or
management personnel involved in the operation of the Business after

employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  

Section 6.03. _Phase-Out of Use of Intangible Property by Buyer_ _; Certain
UPC Codes._

        

(a) " **Retained IP** " means trademarks, service marks, brand names,
copyrights, logos or trade, corporate or business names of Seller or of any
of its Affiliates that are not included in the Acquired Assets but are used
by the Business on Packaging included in the Acquired Assets. "
**Packaging**" means packaging, printed advertising and promotional
materials, invoices, letterhead, company forms, business cards, product
instructions and like materials used by the Business prior to the Closing
Date.

  

(b) Buyer will stop using the Retained IP in its electronic databases and web
sites within 60 days after the Closing Date; _provided_ that with respect to
the Retained IP included in the Exclusive Content, Buyer will stop using such
Retained IP within 60 days after Seller delivers the Exclusive Content.

  

(c) Buyer may use the Packaging included in the Acquired Assets that contain
Retained IP, or sell the Inventory that contains Retained IP, on and after
the Closing Date (without altering or modifying such Packaging or Inventory),
until such Packaging and Inventory is exhausted but in any event no later
than 180 days after the Closing Date, except as provided below; ****
_provided_ that, to the extent that any Packaging is designed for use only in
a particular jurisdiction, Buyer will only use that Packaging in the intended
jurisdiction. Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable, grant to Buyer a non-
exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, nontransferable, non-sublicensable
license to use Retained IP in the Business as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence in the applicable jurisdiction during such period and, in
addition, to use Retained IP in packaging for Products in the applicable
jurisdiction until the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date, but in
each case Buyer must comply with all Applicable Laws in the use of such
Packaging.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cease the use of Retained IP in the Packaging as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. If Buyer manufactures or
produces products on or after the Closing Date for use with such Packaging,
Buyer will give Seller prompt notice thereof, and Seller may reasonably
request, and Buyer will provide, samples of such products to examine and
ensure that such products are of a quality level not materially different
from the Inventory as of the Closing Date. If the products used with such
Packaging are of materially inferior quality, Seller may request that Buyer
raise the quality of the products being manufactured for use with the
Packaging. If Buyer has not, within 30 days of such notice by Seller,
provided Seller with evidence that the quality of its products used in
connection with such Packaging are substantially similar in level of quality
to the Inventory as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall stop using such
Packaging in connection with such products.

  

(d) Without regard to anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer will
not be required at any time to remove the Retained IP from schematics, plans,
manuals, drawings, machines, machinery and the like of the Acquired Business
in existence as of the Closing Date to the extent that such instrumentalities
are used

        

in the ordinary internal conduct of the Acquired Business and are not
generally observed by the public or intended for use as means to effectuate
or enhance sales.

  

(e) Seller agrees that Buyer may use the UPC Codes listed on Schedule 6.03(e)
(the " **Certain UPC Codes** "), and such Certain UPC Codes may continue to
appear on the packaging for the Products for a period not to exceed two
(2) years following the Closing Date, but if GSI (formerly known as the
Uniform Code Council or UCC) requires or recommends that Buyer cease using
the Certain UPC Codes prior to the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date,
Buyer agrees to promptly comply with such requirement or recommendation. All
fines, penalties, costs or charges imposed or incurred by Seller or its
Affiliates in connection with Buyers use of the Certain UPC Codes shall
constitute an Assumed Liability for the purposes of this Agreement. Buyer
agrees that during the term of the Transition Services Agreement, Seller and

thereunder.

Person) and will cause the officers and employees of Buyer to furnish all
information reasonably requested by Seller in connection with accounting,
financial reporting and Tax matters (including financial and Tax audits and
Tax contests), litigation, dispute and other similar reasonable business
purposes, but in each case only to the extent relating to the Acquired
Business prior to the Closing Date. Buyer will not destroy or dispose of any
such Transferred Information without the prior written consent of Seller;
_provided, however_ , that Buyer will be entitled to destroy any of such
Transferred Information after the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date with
the prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided further,_ that if Seller

6.04(a).

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, access to or
possession of any Transferred Information, books and records, materials or
other information, as the case may be, may be denied to the requesting party
if the providing party is advised by counsel that to grant such access or
possession would reasonably be expected to violate any Applicable Law or
result in a loss of

        

the ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege (including any
attorney-client or work-product privilege).

  

Section 6.05. _Recipes. _Buyer acknowledges that Seller and its Affiliates
have used the "CREAM OF WHEAT" and "CREAM OF RICE" trademarks in recipes
appearing in various promotional materials and publications, including

reasonable efforts to obtain the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, including the satisfaction of all conditions thereto (to the extent

cause each of its Affiliates to use, all commercially reasonable best efforts
to cause their respective employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors
and other representatives to cooperate with each other in the preparation of
all documents and the making of all filings in connection with the
Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
and in executing and delivering all documents and instruments and otherwise
taking, or causing to be taken, all actions and doing, or causing to be done,
all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate financing

hereby.

amount of Damages with respect to all such Warranty Breaches
exceeds $2,500,000 and then only to the extent of such excess and (z) Buyers

Section 9.03 _. Procedures.  _(a) The party seeking indemnification under
Section 9.02 (the " **Indemnified Party** ") agrees to give prompt notice to
the party against whom indemnity is sought (the " **Indemnifying Party** ") of
the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or
proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section
stating the amount of the Damages, if known, and method of computation
thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in
respect of which such right of 

        

indemnification is claimed or arises, and agrees to provide the Indemnifying
Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request.  The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to
the extent such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying
Party.

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any claim asserted by any third party (" **Third Party Claim** ") and,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9.03, shall be entitled
to control and appoint lead counsel for such defense, in each case at its
expense.

  

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.03,
with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party,
so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in
writing within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice
of the Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the
Indemnified Party from and against any Damages the Indemnified Party may
suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or
caused by the Third Party Claim to the full extent required hereunder and
with no reservation of rights, (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the
Indemnified Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party that the Indemnifying Party will have the financial resources to defend
against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations
hereunder, (iii) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does
not seek an injunction or other equitable relief, (iv) the Third Party Claim
for indemnification does not relate to or arise in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, and (v)
the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively
and diligently.

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.03, (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
before consenting to the entry of any judgment or entering into any
settlement of such Third Party Claim if the judgment or settlement does not
release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with
respect to such Third Party Claim or the judgment or settlement imposes
injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party and (ii)
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such
purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnified Party, _provided, however_ , that if there exists a conflict of
interest (including the availability of one or more legal defenses to the
Indemnified Party which are not available to the Indemnifying Party) that
would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified
Party (upon

        

and in conformity with advice of counsel) for the same counsel to represent
both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified
Party will be entitled to retain one counsel (plus one local counsel, if
necessary), reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party, provided that the Indemnified Party and such
counsel will contest such Third-Party Claims in good faith. The Indemnified
Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party before
admitting any liability with respect to, or entering into any settlement of,
any Third Party Claim unless the Indemnified Party waives its rights to
indemnification hereunder with respect to such Third Party Claim.

  

(e) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such witnesses, records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  

Section 9.04 _. Calculation of Damages_.  (a) The amount of any Damages
payable under Section 9.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i)
amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any such
Damages or (ii) Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. In computing the
amount of any such Tax Benefit actually realized, such Tax benefit shall be
net of any Tax detriment arising from the receipt of any indemnification
payment. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for
any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying
Party, then such Indemnified Party must promptly notify the Indemnifying
Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the
benefit received by the Indemnified Party (less the reasonable costs incurred
by the Indemnified Party in collecting such amount) within two Business Days
after the benefit is received.  Solely for purposes of calculating the amount
of Damages incurred arising out of or relating to any breach of a
representation or warranty (and not for purposes of determining whether or
not a breach has occurred), the exceptions and qualifications referring to
"Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualifications (or correlative
 terms) shall be disregarded.

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 9.02 for any (i)
consequential, special, incidental, indirect or punitive Damages or (ii)
Damages for lost profits, diminution in value.

  

(c) Each Indemnified Party must mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law
any loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Agreement. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its loss after the

        

Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any indemnification
provision of this Agreement in respect of that loss, the Indemnified Party
must promptly notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the Indemnifying Party
the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified Party of that
mitigation (less the Indemnified Partys reasonable costs of mitigation)
within two Business Days after the benefit is received.

  

Section 9.05 _. Exclusive Remedy. _Except with respect to remedies and
obligations, including indemnification obligations, that are specifically set
forth in Sections 2.07(a), 7.02(c) and 12.10 or any Ancillary Agreement, the
indemnification provided for in this Article 9 will constitute the
sole remedy of either party to this Agreement with respect to the Acquired
Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Excluded
Liabilities, the Business or the subject matter of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including breaches by the other
party to this Agreement of any of the representations, warranties or
agreements contained in this Agreement and any events, circumstances or
conditions which are the subject of the representations, warranties or
agreements contained in this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each party waives, from and after the Closing Date, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, all other rights, claims, and causes of action it may have
against the other parties or their respective representatives and Affiliates
relating to the Acquired Assets, the Excluded Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities, the Excluded Liabilities, the Business or the subject
matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
other than (a) claims for or in the nature of fraud and (b) claims with
respect to obligations, including indemnification obligations, that are
specifically set forth in the Ancillary Agreements.

Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party

comply with the provisions of any bulk transfer or bulk sale laws of any
jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.  Seller agrees to indemnify and hold
Buyer harmless from and against any and all Damages incurred by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates as a result of the failure to comply with any bulk sales or
transfer laws with respect to the Acquired Assets.

  

Section 12.11 _._ _Disclosure Schedules._ (a) Seller may revise the
Disclosure Schedules by delivering revised Disclosure Schedules to Buyer at
least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date.  Buyer shall have the
right to review the revised Disclosure Schedules for a period of five days
after receipt thereof. At any time within such five-day time period, Buyer
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by delivery of a notice to
Seller if the condition set forth in Section 8.02(a) would not be
satisfied if the delivery of revised Disclosure Schedules were not
permitted hereunder. This notice, if given, shall specify the

        

information forming the basis for the decision to terminate. Seller shall
have five days after receipt of such notice to review with Buyer the
information forming the basis of the decision to terminate and to attempt to
agree on corrective measures, if any. If the parties cannot agree on
corrective measures within such five-day period, then this Agreement shall
terminate. If this Agreement is not terminated as permitted by this Section,
Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted such revisions, and the Disclosure
Schedules attached to this Agreement as of the Effective Date shall be deemed
to be superseded by the revised Disclosure Schedules; _provided_ that to the
extent that any such revised information reflects any fact, event
or occurrence that existed or occurred prior to the Effective Date, such
revised information shall not be deemed to have been given for purposes of
determining whether Seller has breached any representation or warranty
contained in Article 3 or 10 or determining whether Buyer or any of its
Affiliates shall be entitled to indemnification in respect thereof.

  

(b) No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the
Disclosure Schedules will be construed as an admission or indication that
such item or other matter is material or that such item or other matter is
required to be referred to or disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules. No
disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach or
violation of any agreement, law or regulation will be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. The exceptions, modifications, descriptions and
disclosures in the Disclosure Schedule are made for all relevant purposes of
this Agreement and are exceptions by Seller to all representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
under this Agreement to the extent readily apparent from a reasonable reading
of the Disclosure Schedules and such other sections of the Agreement that
such disclosure is also applicable to other sections of the
Agreement, notwithstanding any section references contained therein. The
parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Disclosure Schedules may include
certain items and information solely for informational purposes for the
convenience of Buyer and (ii) the disclosure by Seller of any matter in the
Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by
Seller that the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this
Agreement or that the matter is material.

  

(c) Unless otherwise defined in the Disclosure Schedules, all capitalized
terms used in the Disclosure Schedules will have the meanings ascribed to
them in this Agreement.  The attachments to the Disclosure Schedules form an
integral part of the Disclosure Schedules and are incorporated by reference
for all purposes as if set forth fully in the Disclosure Schedules.

  

 _Section 12.12. Severability.  _If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the

        

terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  

 _Section 12.13. Counterparts; Effectiveness. _This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the
same instrument. Executed signature pages delivered by facsimile or e-mail
will be treated in all respects as original signatures. This Agreement shall
become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart
hereof signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

  

Section 12.14 _. Pre-Closing Performance Guaranty. _Guarantor does hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the prompt and full performance by
Buyer of each and every obligation and agreement of Buyer under this
Agreement (each such obligation or agreement, as the same may be amended from
time to time in accordance with this Agreement, an " **Obligation**
"), including the payment to be made pursuant to Article 2 hereof, at the
time and in the manner specified herein.  Guarantor acknowledges and agrees
that, with respect to all Obligations to pay money, such guaranty shall be a
guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection and shall not be
conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against Buyer.
In addition, Guarantor shall be responsible for the accuracy of each and
every representation and warranty made by Buyer under this Agreement, as the
same may be amended from time to time in accordance with this Agreement. The
guaranty set forth in this Section 12.14 shall remain in full force and
effect until all the Obligations are performed in full or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have been consummated in accordance with
the terms hereof. Guarantor understands that Seller is relying on this
guaranty in entering into this Agreement.

  

Section 12.15. _Guaranty Unconditional. _The liabilities and obligations of
the Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement are unconditional and absolute and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released,
discharged or otherwise affected by:

  

(a) any acceleration, extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or
release in respect of any Obligation by operation of law or otherwise;

        

(b) the invalidity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of this
Agreement;

  

(c) any modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement (except
that Guarantors obligations hereunder shall be modified to the extent of any
modification, amendment or supplement to any Obligation or representation or
warranty made by Buyer under this Agreement);

  

(d) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Buyer or
Guarantor or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting any of them or their assets; or

  

(e) any other act, omission to act, delay of any kind by any party hereto or
any other Person, or any other circumstance whatsoever that might, but for
the provisions of this Section 12.15, constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of the obligations of Guarantor hereunder.

  

Section 12.16. _Waiver of the Guarantor. _Guarantor hereby waives any right,
whether legal or equitable, statutory or non-statutory, to require any Person
to proceed against or take any action against or pursue any remedy with
respect to Buyer or any other Person or make presentment or demand for
performance or give any notice of nonperformance before the Seller
may enforce its rights hereunder against Guarantor.

  

Section 12.17. _Discharge only upon Performance in Full; Reinstatement in
Certain Circumstances. _Guarantors obligations hereunder shall remain in
full force and effect until all the Obligations shall have been performed in
full. If at any time any performance by Buyer of any Obligation is rescinded
or must be otherwise restored or returned, whether upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy or reorganization of Buyer or otherwise, Guarantors obligations
hereunder with respect to such Obligation shall be reinstated at such time as
though such Obligation had become due and had not been performed.

  

Section 12.18. _Subrogation. _Upon performance by Guarantor of any
Obligation, Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Seller against
Buyer with respect to such Obligation; _provided_  that Guarantor shall not
enforce any Obligation by way of subrogation against Buyer while any
Obligation is due and unperformed by Buyer.
