 (a Delaware corporation),**

  

 **PRP-GP LLC 
 (a Delaware limited liability company),**

  

 **FMRP INC. 
 (a Delaware corporation),**

 (a Delaware limited partnership)**

  

 **AND**

  

 **PHOSPHATE ACQUISITION PARTNERS L.P. 
 (a Delaware limited partnership)**

  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of March 17, 2004 (this "Merger
Agreement"), is entered into by and among IMC Global Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("IMC"), PRP-GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("PRP-
GP"), FMRP Inc., a Delaware corporation ("FMRP"), Phosphate Resource Partners
Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership ("PLP"), and Phosphate
Acquisition Partners L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Merger Sub").

  

 **RECITALS**

  

A. IMC owns 100% of the limited liability company interests of PRP-GP
and 100% of the stock of FMRP.

  

B. PRP-GP, the administrative managing general partner of PLP, owns a
51.58% general partner interest in PLP, and FMRP, the special general partner
of PLP, owns a 0.02% general partner interest in PLP.

  

C. Merger Sub was recently formed in contemplation of the merger. PRP-
GP, the administrative managing general partner of Merger Sub, owns a 1.0%
limited partner interest and a 98.96125% general partner interest in Merger
Sub, and FMRP, the special general partner of Merger Sub, owns a 0.03875%
general partner interest in Merger Sub.

  

D. The board of directors of PRP-GP has determined that, upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee (as hereinafter defined), it is in the
best interest of PLP and its limited partners (other than those
limited partners who are affiliates of IMC) that PLP merge with and into
Merger Sub with Merger Sub being the surviving entity (the "Merger") and such
board of directors has approved the Merger and this Merger Agreement.

  

E. The Merger and this Merger Agreement have heretofore been approved
and authorized by all partners of Merger Sub pursuant to the partnership
agreement of Merger Sub.

  

F. PRP-GP, as administrative managing general partner of PLP, has
approved and adopted resolutions approving and adopting the Merger and this
Merger Agreement in accordance with the Delaware Revised Uniform
Limited Partnership Act ("DRULPA").

  

G. Consummation of the Merger requires the approval of the Merger and
the Merger Agreement by the owners of more than 50 percent of the partnership
interests in PLP (the "Unit Majority"). IMC and PRP-GP intend to solicit the
vote of the outstanding partnership interests of PLP in order to obtain the
Unit Majority. PRP-GP, as holder of 51.58% of the partnership interests in
PLP, will vote all of such interests in favor of the Merger. FMRP, as holder
of .02% of the partnership interests in PLP, will vote all of such interests
in favor of the Merger. Thus, the Unit Majority will be obtained. Subject to
certain limitations, upon consummation of the merger of PLP with and into
Merger Sub, the limited partner interests of PLP held by limited partners (or
their assignees) of PLP (other than IMC or its affiliates) (collectively, the
"Unitholders") will be converted into the right to receive a number of shares
of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of IMC ("IMC Common Stock")
as described in more detail in Section 1.2(a).

  

H. A special committee of the outside directors of the board of
directors of PRP-GP (the "Special Committee"), consisting solely of persons
who are independent with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
was appointed and has determined with the assistance of its financial and
legal advisors that this Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger and payment of the Merger Consideration (as
defined below), is fair and reasonable to, and is in the best interest of,
PLP and its Unitholders.

  

I. Pursuant to an agreement dated December 19, 2003 between IMC and
Keystone, Inc., a Texas corporation, Alpine Capital, L.P., a Texas limited
partnership, and the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Foundation, a Texas non-
profit corporation (together, the "Selling Unitholders"), the Selling
Unitholders agreed to exchange all of their 30,732,100 limited partner
interests in PLP in exchange for the Merger Consideration (as defined herein
and therein) pursuant to this Merger Agreement.

  

 **AGREEMENTS**

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements
contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  


  **ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER**

  

Section 1.1 _Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.4),
PLP shall merge with and into Merger Sub, the separate existence of PLP shall
cease, and Merger Sub, as the surviving entity, shall continue to exist by
virtue of and shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.

  

Section 1.2 _Merger Value for PLP Limited Partners; IMC Common Stock
Offered_.

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and subject to Section
1.2(d), each PLP Unit outstanding immediately prior thereto will be converted
into the right to receive 0.2 of a share of IMC Common Stock (the "Merger
Consideration"). A Unitholder will receive the Merger Consideration upon the
delivery by such Unitholder of a completed letter of transmittal (the "Letter
of Transmittal") and the surrender of such Unitholder\'s certificates,
depositary receipts ("Depositary Receipts"), or rights relating to any
entry on the books of the transfer agent ("Book Entries"), all of which
represent limited partner interests in PLP (each, a "PLP Unit"). The Letter
of Transmittal will provide instructions as to how to surrender any PLP Units.
IMC has entered into another merger agreement as of January 26, 2004,
pursuant to which it will merge with and into another entity shortly after the
Effective Time (the "Second Merger"). In such event, all holders of IMC
Common Stock would be entitled to receive a new form of consideration in
exchange for their IMC Common Stock (the "Second Merger Consideration").
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, following the Merger, any
Unitholder as of the Effective Time who has not yet received the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the Merger prior to the effectiveness of the Second
Merger shall have the right to receive, from and after the effectiveness of
the Second Merger, the Second Merger Consideration (together with any cash
payable pursuant to Section 1.2(d) hereof) as if such Unitholder
had received, immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Second Merger,
the number of whole shares of IMC Common Stock such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive as a consequence of the Merger.

  

(b) All PLP Units from and after the Effective Time will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate, Depositary Receipt or Book Entry
representing any PLP Units shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the Unitholders shall have the right to receive the amount of
IMC Common Stock to be delivered in consideration therefor upon delivery of
such certificate or Depositary Receipt or cancellation of such Book Entry
in accordance with the instructions of the Letter of Transmittal.

   

(c) Notwithstanding (a) and (b) above, the partnership interests, whether
general or limited, in PLP held by IMC and its affiliates (including PRP-GP
and FMRP) shall be cancelled without any consideration being received
therefor; provided, however, that after the Merger, PRP-GP will continue to
own a combined 99.96125% partnership interest in Merger Sub and FMRP will
continue to own a 0.03875% partnership interest in Merger Sub.

  

(d) No fractional shares of IMC Common Stock will be issued in the merger.
In lieu of receiving a fractional share of IMC Common Stock for any PLP Units,
a Unitholder otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share will be entitled
to receive, from the exchange agent and in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 1.2(d), a cash payment representing such Unitholder\'s
proportionate interest, if any, in the net proceeds from the sale by the
exchange agent in one or more transactions (which sale transactions shall be
made at such times, in such manner and on such terms as the exchange agent
shall determine in its reasonable discretion) on behalf of all such holders of
the aggregate of the fractional shares of IMC Common Stock which would
otherwise have been issued (the "Excess Shares"). The sale of the Excess
Shares by the exchange agent shall be executed on the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE") through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be
executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of
such sale or sales have been distributed to the Unitholders, the exchange
agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the Unitholders. IMC shall pay all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs,
including, without limitation, the expenses and compensation of the exchange
agent, incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares. As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to Unitholders in lieu of any fractional shares of IMC Common Stock, the
exchange agent shall make available such amounts to such Unitholders without
interest.

  

Section 1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place at the offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., 666 Fifth Avenue, New
York, NY 10103, as soon as practicable after the fulfillment of the conditions
referred to in Article III, or at such other time and place as the parties
shall agree (the date of such Closing being the "Closing Date").

  

Section 1.4 _Effective Time of Merger_. Upon satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article III hereof and as soon as practicable after
the Closing, a certificate of merger setting forth the information required
by, and otherwise in compliance with, Section 17-211 of DRULPA with respect
to the Merger, shall be delivered for filing with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of
the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(the "Effective Time"). A form of the certificate of merger is attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_.

  

Section 1.5 _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time of the Merger,
Merger Sub, without further action, as provided by the laws of the State of
Delaware, shall succeed to and possess all the rights, privileges and powers
of PLP, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all debts due on
whatsoever account, as well as all other things and causes of action, of or
belonging to or due to PLP shall be deemed to be vested in Merger Sub without
further act or deed; and the title to any real estate, or any interest
therein, vested in Merger Sub shall not revert or be in any way impaired by
reason of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, all debts,
liabilities, and duties of PLP, including (i) PLP\'s payment and other
obligations under the Indenture dated as of February 1, 1996, between PLP
and Chemical Bank, as trustee, and (ii) franchise taxes, if any, shall attach
to Merger Sub, and may be enforced against Merger Sub to the same extent as if
said debts, liabilities, and duties had been incurred or contracted by it.
Neither the rights of creditors nor any liens upon the property of PLP shall
be impaired by the Merger.

  

Section 1.6 _Certificate of Limited Partnership and Partnership Agreement_.
The certificate of limited partnership of Merger Sub and the partnership
agreement of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Documents") as in effect immediately
prior to the Merger shall be and remain the Merger Sub Documents after the
Effective Time, until the same shall thereafter be altered, amended, or
repealed in accordance with the law and the Merger Sub Documents.

  

Section 1.7 _Exchange of PLP Units for IMC Common Stock_. 

  

(a) IMC shall mail certificates representing shares of IMC Common Stock to
the Unitholders of record promptly following the Closing Date in payment of
the Merger Consideration, if such Unitholders have surrendered their
certificates or Depositary Receipts or cancelled their Book Entries
representing PLP Units in accordance with the instructions and procedures set
forth in the Letter of Transmittal delivered to the Unitholders following the
Effective Time.

  

(b) After the Effective Time, there shall not be any further registration
of transfers on the transfer books of PLP of the PLP Units that were issued
and outstanding immediately before the Closing Date and were converted into
the right to receive IMC Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates, Depositary Receipts or Book Entries representing PLP Units are
presented, they shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided
for in this Article. No dividends or other distributions with respect to IMC
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered PLP Units with respect to the IMC Common Stock to
be received in respect thereof and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.2(d), in each
case until the surrender of such PLP Units. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such PLP Units, there shall be
paid to the holder of the whole ****shares of IMC Common Stock issued in
respect thereof, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of IMC Common Stock
to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.2(d) and the
proportionate amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of IMC Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
proportionate amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of IMC
Common Stock.

Effect.

  

(b) _No Conflicts_. Consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and compliance with the terms and provisions of this Merger Agreement
will not conflict with, result in a breach of, require notice under or
constitute a default under (i) the Merger Sub Documents, (ii) any material

authority or (iii) any material agreement, indenture or instrument to which
Merger Sub is a party.

enforceable in accordance with its terms. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to,

any related documents that may be required by the SEC, (iii) the filing of
