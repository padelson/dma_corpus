Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Debt, Closing Date Transaction
Expenses and Purchase Price determinations are final and binding on the
parties pursuant to this _Section 2.3_, Dover US and its accountants shall

(b) Following receipt of the Preliminary Closing Statement, if Dover
US has any objections to such document as prepared by Buyer, Dover US
shall deliver written notice to Buyer of such dispute within forty-five (45)

shall engage the Auditors to conduct a review of Dover US's objections to the
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, Preliminary Working Capital
Determination, Preliminary Cash Determination, Preliminary Debt
Determination, Preliminary Transaction Expenses Determination and/or
Preliminary Purchase Price Determination, as the case may be, as promptly as
reasonably practicable (such review to be completed not later than thirty (30)
days after the Auditors are requested to conduct such review) and, upon
completion of such review, to deliver written notice to Dover US and Buyer
setting forth the Auditors' resolution of such objections and the resulting
adjustments shall be deemed finally determined for purposes of this _Section
2.3_. The Auditors' role in completing such review shall be limited to
resolving such objections and determining the correct calculations to be used
with respect to only the disputed portions of the Preliminary Closing
Statement. In resolving such objections, the Auditors shall apply the
provisions of this Agreement concerning determination of the amounts set forth
in the Preliminary Closing Statement and the decision of the Auditors shall
be solely based on (i) whether such item objected to was prepared in
accordance with the guidelines set forth in this Agreement concerning
determination of the amounts set forth therein or (ii) whether the
item objected to contains a mathematical or clerical error. The Preliminary
Closing Date Balance Sheet, Preliminary Working Capital Determination,
Preliminary Cash Determination, Preliminary Debt Determination, Preliminary
Transaction Expenses Determination and Preliminary Purchase Price
Determination as agreed by Buyer and Dover US or as determined by the
Auditors, as the case may be, shall be final and binding as the " _Closing
Date Balance Sheet_ ," " _Closing Date Working Capital_ ," " _Closing Date
Cash_ ", " _Closing Date Debt_ ", " _Closing Date Transaction Expenses_ " and
" _Purchase Price_ ", respectively, for purposes of this Agreement.

Financing Commitments, other than as expressly set forth herein and in
the Financing Commitments. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
contained in _Section 9.1_ and _Section 9.3_ , as of the date hereof, Buyer
does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or that the Financing or any
other funds necessary for the satisfaction of all of Buyer's and its
Affiliates' obligations under this Agreement and of all fees and expenses
reasonably expected to be incurred in connection herewith will not be
available to Buyer on the Closing Date, subject to the completion of the

under this Agreement. Except for fee letters with respect to fees and related
arrangements with respect to the Financing, of which Buyer has delivered a
true, correct and complete copy to Dover US prior to the date of this
Agreement (other than with respect to fee amounts, pricing caps and other
economic terms, and the rates and amounts included in the "market flex"
provisions, which may be redacted, but which redacted information do not

precedent to, the funding of the Financing), engagement letters and fee credit
letters, as of the date of this Agreement there are no side letters or other
agreements, Contracts or arrangements related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments and delivered to Dover US prior to the date of this Agreement.

request) in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the

confidential information memorandum for the Financing and other customary
marketing materials to be used in connection therewith, (ii) providing all
customary information with respect to the Acquired Companies and the IP

documents, other definitive financing documents (including obtaining pay-off
letters, lien releases and instruments of termination or discharge), or other
certificates or documents contemplated by the Financing Commitments and

Companies, (iv) participating in one or more meetings of prospective lenders
(and to the extent necessary, conference calls with prospective lenders)
under the Financing at times and locations to be mutually agreed upon; (v)
furnishing Buyer promptly with all documentation and other information as
reasonably requested by Buyer at or prior to the Closing Date in connection
with such Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations; and (vi) ensuring that there shall be no
competing issuances, offerings, placements or arrangements of debt securities
or commercial bank or other credit facilities, being issued, offered, placed
or arranged by the Acquired Companies or any of their Subsidiaries if such
debt securities or commercial bank or other credit facilities could, in the
good faith judgment of the lead arranger for the Financing, materially impair
the primary syndication of the Financing.

  



  

(e) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this _Section 7.6_ , Sellers and Sellers'
Affiliates and representatives have no responsibility for any financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing and the
Alternative Financing) that Buyer may raise in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be requested to sign
any authorization letter to the Debt Financing Sources. Sellers and Sellers'
Affiliates shall not have any responsibility for any offering materials or
other related documents prepared by or on behalf of or utilized by Buyer or
its Affiliates, Lenders or other financing sources, in connection with
Buyer's financing activities related to the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any offering memorandum, banker's book or any other written

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
compliance by Buyer with this _Section 7.6_ shall not relieve Buyer of its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
whether or not the Financing is available.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Cooperation Regarding Financial Statements_. Dover US
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts and, prior to the Closing,
shall cause the Acquired Companies to use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts, to provide to Buyer and Buyer's auditors all cooperation
reasonably requested by Buyer and that is customary in connection with the
conduct of the Carve-Out Audit by Buyer, in each case at Buyer's sole cost
and expense, including providing all customary access and information with
respect to the Acquired Companies, the IP Assets and the Business as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer and Buyer's auditors (in each case subject to
customary confidentiality arrangements which are no less restrictive than the
Confidentiality Agreement). If requested by Buyer, Dover US shall, and hereby
does, consent to Buyer's engagement of Dover US' independent auditors for
purposes of preparing the Carve-Out Audit and, subject to compliance with
such auditors' internal conflict and confidentiality policies and procedures,
the release of any work papers, underlying work product and/or support
documentation previously prepared by such auditors with respect to the
Acquired Companies and Business to the extent such materials would be useful
to the preparation of the Carve-Out Audit. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
shall be solely responsible for the fees of its auditor (including, if
applicable, any auditor engaged by Buyer pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence) incurred with respect to the Carve-Out Audit. Prior to
the Closing Date, Dover US shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide to Buyer, and shall cause each of the Acquired Companies to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer, unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements of the Acquired Companies for each
quarterly period ended after December 31, 2014 and ended at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the Closing.

to indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against any
Losses and Expenses of or incurred by such Buyer Group Member in connection
with or arising from, (x) any Taxes of or imposed on any of the Acquired

Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date (including any Section

otherwise be liable as a result of any transaction outside the ordinary
course of business occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing at the
direction of Buyer or (C) any Taxes (other than Section 338(h)(10) Taxes and
any Taxes resulting from the sale of Sargent Aerospace) that result from any
actual or deemed election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code or any similar
provisions of U.S. state, local or non-U.S. law as a result of the purchase
of the Shares or that result from Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, or any of
the Acquired Companies engaging in any activity or transaction that would

other Taxes, by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two
taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date
and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing
Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Acquired
Companies for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable
years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the
books of the Acquired Companies were closed at the close of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) non-ordinary course transactions occurring
on the Closing Date that are properly allocable to the portion of the Closing
Date after the Closing shall be allocated to the taxable year or period that
is deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and
(B) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned between
such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis.

Affiliate thereof (other than the Acquired Companies) (each, a " _Seller
Combined Return_ ") and (B) all other income Tax Returns that are required to
be filed by or with respect to the Acquired Companies for taxable years or
periods ending on or before the Closing Date. In each case, Dover US shall
timely remit or cause to be remitted (to the applicable taxing authority or
Acquired Company, as appropriate, and taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Buyer shall
timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into account all
extensions properly obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be

manner consistent with the past practice of the Acquired Companies and, on
such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted

with a draft copy of such Tax Return for its review and reasonable comment.

permit the Acquired Companies to) file, amend, re-file or otherwise modify
(or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to the Acquired Companies with respect to
any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date (or with
respect to any Straddle Period), or take any other action (including any
voluntary disclosure) that would increase any Tax liability attributable to
the Acquired Companies in respect of any taxable year or period ending on or
before the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Dover US (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), in each case except as
may be required by a Requirement of Law.

  



  

(iv) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies
to prepare and provide to Dover US a package of Tax information
materials, including, without limitation, schedules and work papers (the "

practice as to providing such information and as to the method of computation
of separate taxable income or other relevant measure of income of the
Acquired Companies; _provided_ , that Dover US shall provide Buyer with prompt
and reasonable guidance regarding such past practices. Buyer shall cause the
Tax Package to be delivered to Dover US within 120 days after the Closing
Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Closing Date occurs after July

Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of the Acquired Companies of

Tax audits, examinations or assessments which would reasonably be expected to
affect the Tax liabilities for which Dover US would be liable pursuant to this
_Section 8.1_.

  



  

(ii) Dover US shall have the right at its sole cost and expense to
represent the Acquired Companies' interests in any income Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding relating to taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date or otherwise relating to Seller Indemnified Taxes,
and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; provided that, other than

(w) notifies Buyer of its election to control such proceeding within ten (10)
days of receiving notice thereof, (x) prosecutes such proceeding diligently
and in good faith, (y) keeps Buyer reasonably informed regarding the status
of such proceeding and (z) does not agree to any settlement of such proceeding
if such settlement would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the tax
liability of a Buyer Group Member for any Tax period (or portion thereof)

which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the case of a
Straddle Period, Dover US shall be entitled to participate at its expense in
any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating (in whole or in
part) to Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
and including the Closing Date and, with the written consent of Buyer, and at

(e) _Section 338 Election_.

  



  

(i) Buyer and Sellers agree that Buyer shall not make nor cause or
permit to be made any election under Section 338 of the Code or under any
applicable similar provision of state or foreign law with respect to the
purchase and sale of Sargent Canada or Sonic pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) Buyer and Dover US shall join in making an election with respect
to Avborne under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and under similar
provisions of state or local law with respect to the purchase of the Avborne
Shares (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ "), and none of Buyer or Sellers
(or any of their respective Affiliates) shall take any action or fail to take
any action that could reasonably be expected to preclude or invalidate the
Section 338(h)(10) Election. Dover US and Buyer shall each deliver
completed and executed copies of IRS Form 8023, required schedules thereto,
and any similar state and foreign forms at the Closing in accordance with
_Sections 3.3(g)_ and _3.4(n)_ (relating to Closing Date deliveries). If any
changes are required in these forms as a result of information which is first
available after these forms are prepared, the parties will promptly make such
changes. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees that neither it nor any of its
Affiliates shall take, or fail to take, any action to the extent such action
or failure to act, as the case may be, is inconsistent with or would otherwise
prejudice any Section 338(h)(10) Election.

  



  

(f) _Treatment for U.S. Income Tax Purposes_. Buyer and Sellers
shall treat (A) the purchase and sale of Avborne as a purchase and sale for
which an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code has been made and (B)

assets, in each case for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and, to the greatest

proceeding before the Internal Revenue Service or any state and local taxing
authority.

existing tax sharing agreements (or other similar agreements or
arrangements) to which any Acquired Company is a party to be terminated as of

Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall make an offer of employment to
each individual who is employed by any Affiliate of the Acquired Companies
(other than any Acquired Company) and whose services primarily relate to the
Business (including each employee who is not actively at work on account of
illness, disability or leave of absence) as of the date of such offer (a "
_Transferring Employee_ "). Such offers of employment shall be effective as
of, and contingent upon, the Closing, and shall be on terms and conditions
not less favorable than those in effect for such Transferring Employees
immediately prior to the Closing. _Schedule 8.2(a)_ lists all Transferring
Employees, including their name, job, title, annual salary, and the name of
their employer. Such offers of employment for each such Transferring Employee
will supersede any prior agreements regarding the terms and conditions of
employment as in effect prior to the Closing. Transferring Employees who
accept such offer of employment from Buyer or any of its Affiliates, and all
of the employees of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing (including each
employee who is not actively at work on account of illness, disability or
leave of absence), shall collectively be referred to as the " _Affected
Employees_ ". Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
Liability arising from or relating to the separation from employment with any
Affiliate of the Acquired Companies of any Transferring Employee, including
severance, termination indemnity, or similar payments. Nothing in this Section
8.2 shall limit the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to terminate
the employment of any employee (including any Affected Employee) at any time
and for any or no reason.

(b) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending no
earlier than the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date (or,
if earlier, the date of termination of employment of the relevant employee),
Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to provide each Affected Employee
base wages or salaries and cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable
than the rates of wages or salaries paid and cash bonus opportunities offered
to such Affected Employee by the respective Acquired Company or Affiliate
of an Acquired Company immediately prior to the date hereof; provided,
however, that Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to comply with the
CBA in all respects as it relates to the Affected Employees covered thereby.

  



  

(c) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending no
earlier than the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date (or,
if earlier, the date of termination of employment of the relevant employee),
Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to provide each Affected Employee
with employee benefit plans and programs (other than defined benefit pension
plans, severance plans or programs, equity-based plans or arrangements,
nonqualified deferred compensation plans or arrangements or post-termination
or retiree welfare benefit plans or arrangements) (" _Buyer 's Benefit
Programs_") that are no less favorable in the aggregate to such Affected
Employee as those provided to such Affected Employee as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to any Affected Employee whose
employment is terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates on or prior to
the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates shall provide such Affected Employee with severance benefits that
are no less favorable than (i) those severance benefits available to such
Affected Employee under the Plans, or any other Contract or arrangement in
place on the date hereof or entered into after the date hereof and prior to
the Closing in accordance with _Section 7.4_ , or (ii) those severance
benefits available to similarly situated employees of Buyer or its
Affiliates, whichever is more favorable; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,

(d) Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to credit Affected
Employees with all service credited to such Affected Employees as of
the Closing Date in addition to service earned with Buyer or its Affiliates
after the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and levels of
benefits, and determining the amount of any vacation, sick days, severance,
layoff and similar benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension plan, and not for any purpose under any equity-
based plan or arrangement) under Buyer's Benefit Programs to the extent such
service was credited for the same purpose under an analogous Plan immediately
prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall or shall cause
its Affiliates to comply with the CBA in all respects as it relates to the
Affected Employees covered thereby to the extent required by the terms of
the CBA or Requirements of Law and provided that no such service shall be
credited to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits or
compensation. Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to waive any pre-
existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements,
actively at work requirements or waiting periods for participation and
coverage applicable under Buyer's Benefit Programs with respect to Affected
Employees and their dependents to the extent such exclusions, requirements or
waiting periods were satisfied or did not apply to such Affected Employees
and their dependents under the Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date.
Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to use commercially reasonable
efforts to credit Affected Employees with any amounts paid under a Plan
maintained by any Seller or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date
for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, coinsurance or out-of-
pocket requirements for the applicable plan year that includes the Closing
Date as if such amounts had been paid under a corresponding Buyer's Benefit
Program.

  



  

(e) Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to provide, honor and
recognize all accrued but unused vacation for the Affected Employees as of
the Closing Date.

  



  

(f) As of the Closing, each of the Acquired Companies shall
terminate its participation in each Plan that is not sponsored or
maintained by such Acquired Company, and in no event shall any Affected
Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits under such Plans with respect to
services rendered or compensation paid on or after the Closing Date except as
specified in the terms of any such Plan. Except as specifically set forth on
_Schedule 8.2(f)_ and except for any Related Party Contracts set forth on
Schedule 7.5, Sellers and their Affiliates (other than any of the Acquired
Companies) shall assume and retain the sponsorship of and be
solely responsible for all Liabilities relating to or at any time arising
under or in connection with any Plan, any "employee benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA), and any other compensation or benefit plan,
program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement of any kind at any time
maintained, sponsored or contributed to or required to be contributed to by
any of the Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies) or under or with respect to which any of the Sellers, or
any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) has any
Liability. The Sellers shall be solely responsible for any obligations under
Code Section 4980B with respect to all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9. Buyer and the Acquired
Companies shall retain or assume all rights and obligations under each
Plan that is sponsored or maintained by the Acquired Companies, whether
arising prior to, on or after the Closing Date.

  



  

(g) As of the Closing Date, all Affected Employees shall cease to
contribute to and shall become fully vested in their account balances under
the Dover Corporation Retirement Savings Plan (the " _Dover 401(k) Plan_ ").
Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall make to the Dover 401(k) Plan all
employer matching contributions that would otherwise have been required to be
made as of such date had the Closing not occurred.

(h) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date (and in any event
not later than sixty (60) days thereafter), Buyer or its Affiliates shall
establish or designate, or shall cause the Acquired Companies to establish or
designate, a defined contribution plan (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "). Each
Affected Employee who is eligible to participate in the Dover 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date shall become eligible to participate in
the Buyer 401(k) Plan as soon as practicable after the Closing Date (and in
any event not later than sixty (60) days thereafter). The Buyer 401(k) Plan
shall be qualified as a salary deferral plan under Section 401(k) of the Code
and shall provide the Affected Employees with credit for service and for all
purposes for which such service was recognized under the Dover 401(k) Plan,
including vesting and eligibility to participate, (i) with Dover Corporation
and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and their respective
predecessors prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) with Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) for all periods on and after the
Closing Date. Effective after the Closing Date, each Affected Employee who,
as of the Closing Date, is a participant in the Dover 401(k) Plan shall
be entitled to a distribution of his or her account balance in accordance
with the terms of the Dover 401(k) Plan as in effect from time to time and
applicable Requirements of Law, and Buyer shall take any and all action
necessary to ensure that the Buyer 401(k) Plan shall accept "direct
rollovers" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of
distributions from the Dover 401(k) Plan, including the amount of any unpaid
balance of any participant loan made under the Dover 401(k) Plan, if
such rollovers are elected by any Affected Employees.

  



  

(i) The parties do not intend for this Section 8.2 to amend any
Plans or arrangements or other benefit or compensation plans,
programs, policies, agreements or create any rights or obligations except
between the parties (including any third-party beneficiary rights); (ii) no
Affected Employee or other current or former employee of any of the Acquired
Companies, including any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any other
Person not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled to assert any claim
hereunder; (iii) except as provided in this _Section 8.2_ nothing shall limit
the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including following the
Closing, the Acquired Companies) from amending, modifying or terminating any
benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement at
any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; and
(iv) nothing in this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of any Affected
Employee following the Closing.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 8.3(b)_ , as a material inducement to Buyer
to enter into this Agreement, Sellers shall not, and each Seller shall cause
each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (whether by itself,
through an Affiliate or in partnership or conjunction with, or as a member,
owner, consultant or agent of, any other Person):

  



  

(i) for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, own,
manage, control, undertake, participate in, carry on, be engaged in, or in
any other manner advise or knowingly assist any other Person in connection
with the operation of, any Competing Business Activities anywhere in the
world; and

solicit, entice, encourage or influence, or attempt to solicit, entice,
encourage or influence, any Affected Employee to resign or otherwise leave

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 8.3(a)_ , Sellers and their respective
Affiliates shall not be prohibited from or restricted in any way with
respect to: (i) advertising job openings by use of newspapers, magazines, the
Internet and other media not directed at Affected Employees or hiring any
such Affected Employees that responds solely as a result thereof, (ii) hiring
or soliciting any Affected Employee who has terminated employment with Buyer,
any Acquired Company or any Affiliate thereof, so long as there was no
solicitation by any Seller or its Affiliates prior thereto; (iii) continuing
to engage in any business that any such Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies) engages in as of the date of this
Agreement, (iv) holding not more than ten percent (10%) of the outstanding
voting securities of any company (whether public or private) that is primarily
engaged in Competing Business Activities, provided such Seller or Affiliate
does not control, directly or indirectly, such company, or (v) acquiring,
and following such acquisition, actively engaging in any business that has a
subsidiary, division, group, franchise or segment that is engaged in any
Competing Business Activity, so long as for the most recent fiscal year ending
prior to the date of such acquisition, the revenues derived from the
Competing Business Activities were less than fifteen (15%) of the total
consolidated revenues of such business.

  



  

(c) Each Seller acknowledges that a violation of this _Section 8.3_
may cause Buyer irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for
by money damages. Each Seller therefore agrees that in the event of any actual
or threatened violation of this _Section 8.3_ , Buyer shall be entitled, in
addition to other remedies that it may have, to seek a temporary restraining
order and to seek preliminary and final injunctive relief against such Seller
or such Affiliate of such Seller to prevent any violations of this _Section
8.3_, without the necessity of posting a bond.

  



  

(d) The Sellers recognize and acknowledge that the territorial,
time, line of business and other scope provisions set forth in this
_Section 8.3_ are reasonable and are properly required for the protection of
Buyer's legitimate interest in client relationships, goodwill and trade
secrets of the business being acquired by Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that any such territorial,
time, line of business or scope provision is deemed to be unreasonable,
against public policy or otherwise unenforceable as written by a court of
competent jurisdiction, Buyer and the Sellers agree, and the Sellers
submit, to such court's alteration, amendment or reduction of any or all of
said territorial, time or scope limitations so as to make such provisions be
valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with the applicable
laws of such jurisdiction (giving maximum effect to this _Section 8.3_ as
drafted to the extent compatible with such laws), such amendment only to apply
with respect to the operation of such provision in the applicable
jurisdiction in which such adjudication is made. If such partial
enforcement is not possible, the provision shall be deemed severed, and the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

Section 8.4 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing until
the expiration of Buyer's obligation under _Section 12.6_ , each Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, treat and hold as confidential and refrain
from disclosing to any third party all Confidential Information; provided,
that each Seller or Affiliate thereof may disclose Confidential Information
(A) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or any disputes
or actions in connection therewith, or to comply with legal or accounting
requirements (including the rules of the New York Stock Exchange), (B) to the
extent required for Tax reporting or filing purposes or preparation of
financial statements, (C) to the extent reasonably required to be
incorporated into or consolidated with financial and/or tax information of
other businesses of Sellers or their Affiliates or (D) to any other Person to
which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or appropriate in
connection with any litigation to enforce its rights under this Agreement, the
Buyer Ancillary Agreements or the Seller Ancillary Agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, in the event that a Seller or any
its Affiliates is requested or required by applicable Requirements of Law,
regulation, stock exchange rule or Proceeding (including pursuant to written
or oral question or request for information or documents) to disclose any
Confidential Information, such Seller or Affiliate shall be entitled to so
comply; provided that to the extent legally permissible, Dover US shall notify
RBC Parent promptly of the request or requirement so that RBC Parent may seek
(at its sole cost) an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with
the provisions of this Section 8.4. If, in the absence of a protective order
or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, any such Seller or Affiliate, based on
the advice of legal counsel, is required to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Seller or Affiliate may disclose the Confidential
Information solely to the extent so required; provided, however, that such
Seller or Affiliate shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (at
Buyer's sole cost) an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to
be disclosed as Buyer shall designate.

deliver to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified
Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ "), which shall be
delivered promptly after the Indemnified Party acquires actual knowledge of
the basis for a claim for indemnification hereunder and which shall describe
in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such claim, and shall include in
such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount, or the method of computation of
the amount, of such claim and a reference to the provision of this Agreement
or any other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in
connection herewith upon which such claim is based; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure or delay of the Indemnified Party to provide a Claim Notice

obligations hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have
been prejudiced by such failure.

  



    

63 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) After the timely delivery of any Claim Notice pursuant to
_Section 11.3(a)_ , the amount of indemnification to which an
Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this _Article XI_ shall be
determined (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnitor, (ii) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnitor shall agree in writing. The judgment or decree of a court shall
be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no
appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been
finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in
establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses suffered by it.

  



  

Section 11.4 _Third Person Claims_ _._

  



  

(a) Any party seeking indemnification provided for under this
Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand
made by any third Person against the Indemnified Party, other than an
Indemnifiable Proceeding (a " _Third Person Claim_ "), shall notify the
Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third Person Claim
within ten (10) Business Days (or reasonably more promptly dependent upon the
circumstances) after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of
the Third Person Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Indemnitor, within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified Party's
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnitor relating to the Third Person Claim. Any notice of
a claim by reason of any of the representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement shall refer to the provision of this Agreement
upon which such claim is based and describe in reasonable detail (to the
extent known) the facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the claim and the
amount of the liability asserted against the Indemnitor by reason of the
Third Person Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure or delay of the
Indemnified Party to give notice to the Indemnitor as provided in this
_Section 11.4_ shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been prejudiced by such
failure.

  



  

(b) In the event of the initiation of a Third Person Claim, the
Indemnitor shall have the sole and absolute right after the receipt
of notice, at its option and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel
of its choice and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with any Proceeding which relates to any Losses and Expenses indemnified
against hereunder; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may
participate in any such Proceeding with counsel of its choice (and the fees
and expenses of one such firm of counsel in connection with such Third Party
Claim shall nonetheless be considered Expenses for the purposes of this
Agreement); _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor shall not
be entitled to assume or continue control of the defense of any Third Person
Claim if (i) the Third Person Claim relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal Proceeding, (ii) the Third Person Claim seeks an Order,
injunction, equitable relief or other relief other than money damages against
any Indemnified Party, (iii) the Indemnitor refuses to or fails to provide
notice to the Indemnified Party that it irrevocably and unconditionally
assumes responsibility for the defense of the Third Party Claim under this
_Section 11.4_ , or (iv) the Indemnitor refuses to or fails to diligently
defend the Third Party Claim after giving notice of its intent to assume the
defense under this _Section 11.4_. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully
with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of
any Third Person Claim. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend such
Third Person Claim, or is not entitled to defend such Third Person Claim
pursuant to this _Section 11.4(b)_ , and the Indemnified Party defends
against or otherwise deals therewith, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel
at the expense of the Indemnitor, which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such Proceeding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitor shall be obligated pursuant to
this _Section 11.4_ to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties. Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party may
settle any such Proceeding which settlement obligates the other party to pay
money, to perform obligations (including to refrain from taking any actions)
or to admit liability without the prior written consent of the other party,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the
Indemnified Party shall refuse to consent to the settlement of any Third
Person Claim, so long as only money damages are involved and there is no
admission of liability or wrongdoing with respect to the Indemnified Party,
the liability of the Indemnitor in respect of such Third Person Claim shall
not exceed the amount for which the Third Person Claim could have been settled
plus the amount of expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to the
time of and in connection with the proposed settlement to which it is entitled
to indemnification.

(c) To the extent of any inconsistency between this _Section 11.4_
and _Section 8.1(c)_ (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of _Section
8.1(c)_ shall control with respect to Tax contests.

  



  

Section 11.5 _Procedures for Indemnifiable Proceedings_ _._

  



  

(a) Buyer shall, on behalf of any Buyer Group Member seeking
indemnification under _Section 11.1(a)(iii)_ in respect of a
Proceeding initiated by any third Person against such Buyer Group Member (in
each case which Buyer reasonably determines in good faith is an Indemnifiable
Proceeding), notify Dover US in writing, and in reasonable detail, of such
Indemnifiable Proceeding within ten (10) Business Days (or reasonably more
promptly dependent upon the circumstances) after receipt by such Buyer Group
Member of written notice of such Indemnifiable Proceeding. Thereafter, Buyer
shall deliver to Dover US, as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days after the applicable Buyer Group Member's
receipt thereof), copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received thereby relating to such Indemnifiable Proceeding.

  



  

(b) Following written notification by Buyer to Dover US of any
Indemnifiable Proceeding pursuant to _Section 11.5(a)_ , Dover US shall
control, defend against, negotiate, settle and otherwise deal with such
Indemnifiable Proceeding with counsel of its own choice and in its sole
discretion. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall
cooperate fully with Dover US in connection with the defense, negotiation and
settlement of any Indemnifiable Proceeding, including by making witnesses and
documents available promptly and as reasonably requested, and by preserving
relevant data and documents. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
that Buyer engages its own counsel in connection with any such cooperation
(or in connection with any other matters set forth in this  _Section 11.5_ ),
such counsel shall be so engaged at Buyer's sole expense.

(c) Following written notification by Buyer to Dover US of any
Indemnifiable Proceeding pursuant to _Section 11.5(a)_ , if it is
determined (i) by written agreement between Dover US and Buyer, (ii) by a
final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction or (iii) by
Dover US in its good faith reasonable discretion, that any Proceeding
initially characterized for purposes of this Agreement as an Indemnifiable
Proceeding is not actually an Indemnifiable Proceeding, then such Proceeding
shall be deemed to be a " _Buyer Proceeding_ " for purposes of this
Agreement, and (x) Dover US shall have no indemnification obligations with
respect to such Buyer Proceeding and (y) Buyer shall indemnify the Seller
Group Members in respect of such Buyer Proceeding in accordance with (and
subject to) this _Article XI_. In such event, Buyer shall assume sole control
and defense of such Buyer Proceeding as soon as practicable, and Dover US
shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) deliver
to Buyer copies of all case files relating to such Buyer Proceeding. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Dover US shall reasonably cooperate
with Buyer at Buyer's expense in transitioning such Buyer Proceeding to Buyer.

  



  

(d) Buyer and Dover US agree that in the event it becomes
unreasonably burdensome (in Dover US's sole discretion) on an ongoing
basis to determine whether or not Proceedings are Indemnifiable Proceedings
or Buyer Proceedings, Dover US and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to
promptly agree to policies and procedures to make such determinations more
efficiently and to administrate such Proceedings more efficiently (in all
cases without altering the parties' respective responsibility therefor under
this _Article XI_ and otherwise in keeping with this _Article XI_ ).

  



  

Section 11.6 _Determination of Indemnification Amounts_ _._

  



  

(a) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in
this _Article XI_, for purposes of computing the amount of any and all
Losses and Expenses recoverable under this _Article XI_, there shall be
deducted (i) an amount equal to the amount of any Tax Benefit realized by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates in connection with such Losses and
Expenses, and (ii) an amount equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds
(other than any insurance proceeds from any "representations and warranties"
insurance policy obtained by Buyer in connection with the transaction
contemplated herein to provide coverage in excess of Dover US' indemnity
obligations hereunder), indemnification payments, contribution payments or
reimbursements actually received (net of costs of enforcement, deductibles
and retro-premium adjustments) by the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates in connection with such Losses or Expenses or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto (it being understood that the Indemnified
Party and any of its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such Tax Benefits and insurance proceeds, payments or reimbursements).
The calculation of Losses and Expenses shall not include losses arising
because of a change after the Closing in applicable Requirements of Law or
accounting principles. For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any
refund or credit of Taxes to be paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which
otherwise would be owed in the absence of indemnifiable Losses and Expenses
by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, as applicable, in each case
computed at the highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient of
such benefit.

  



  

(b) Any indemnification payment under this Agreement shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes to the
greatest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law.

--- 

    



  

(c) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third
Persons any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an
Indemnitor has indemnified it pursuant to this _Article XI_, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so
recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred
by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the amount previously
so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect
of such matter.

  



  

(d) Each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate their respective Losses and Expenses upon and after
becoming aware of any event or condition which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any Losses and Expenses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

  



  

(e) Dover US shall not be required to indemnify and hold harmless
any Buyer Group Member pursuant to _Section 11.1_ to the extent the matter in
question was taken into account in the computation of the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Sections 2.3_ and _2.4_.

  



  

Section 11.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Each Seller, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the
Closing, except in the case of fraud, for the equitable remedies expressly
contemplated in _Section 12.15_ , and as otherwise specifically set forth in
this Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary Agreement or Seller Ancillary Agreement,
its sole and exclusive remedy against the other party and its respective
Affiliates, including for the Losses and Expenses of any Buyer Group Member or
Seller Group Member, as applicable, relating (directly or indirectly) to the
subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
regardless of whether such claims arise in contract, tort, breach of warranty
or any other legal or equitable theory, shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article XI_ and Section 8.1.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may otherwise have or to which
they may become entitled except for claims of fraud or willful breach.

  



  

Article XII

  



  

 _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

  



  

Section 12.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and
Covenants_. Each representation and warranty contained in this Agreement shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
for the respective period of time for which indemnification is available with
respect to such representation or warranty as set forth in _Section 11.1(b)_
or _Section 11.2(b)_ , as applicable. All covenants and other agreements
contained in this Agreement shall survive until performed in accordance
with their respective terms or, if no term is expressly stated, until the
expiration of the statute of limitations period applicable to the matters
covered thereby.

  

  



  

Section 12.2 _Confidential Nature of Information_. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the Confidentiality Agreement remains in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms following the date hereof
and through the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in
the event of the termination of this Agreement for any reason, the terms and
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive such termination in
accordance with the terms therein. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate on the Closing Date. Sellers agree, and agree to cause their
Affiliates to, enforce, at Buyer's request and expense, their or such
Affiliates' rights under any confidentiality, non-disclosure or other similar
agreement entered into in connection with the sale of the Business.

Section 12.3 _No Public Announcement_. Neither Buyer nor Sellers
shall, without the approval of the other (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), make or cause to be made any
press release or other public announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that
any such party shall be so obligated by applicable Requirements of Law, in
which case the other party shall be advised and the parties shall use their
reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to
be issued.

  



  

Section 12.4 _Notices_. All notices or other communications required
or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or made

Section 12.5 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no party to this Agreement may assign its rights or delegate its
obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written consent of
the other parties to this Agreement, except that (i) each party shall be
permitted to assign its rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to an
Affiliate of such party (provided that no such assignment or delegation will
relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder) and (ii) Buyer may
collaterally assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any Financing
Source or any other party providing debt financing to Buyer or its
subsidiaries (in each case, unless to do so would restrict or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

  



  

Section 12.6 _Access to Records after Closing_. Subject to _Section
8.4_ , for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Sellers and
their respective representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the
books and records of the Acquired Companies to the extent that such access
may reasonably be required by any such Seller in connection with any matter
relating to or affected by the operations of the Acquired Companies on or
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be
required to violate any obligation of confidentiality to which Buyer or any
Acquired Company is subject or to waive any privilege which any of them may
possess in discharging its obligations pursuant to this _Section 12.6_ ;
_provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that in any such case, Buyer shall, and
shall cause any applicable Acquired Company to, reasonably cooperate
with Sellers to seek an appropriate remedy to permit the access contemplated
hereby. Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each Seller acknowledges and agrees that such access shall not interfere
unreasonably with the operations of the Acquired Companies or Buyer. Each
Seller shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it
pursuant to this _Section 12.6_. If Buyer or the Acquired Companies shall
desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of
such six (6)-year period, Buyer shall, prior to such disposition, give
Sellers a reasonable opportunity, at Sellers' expense, to segregate and remove
such books and records as any Seller may select.

Section 12.7 _Entire Agreement; Amendments; Third Party
Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein,
the documents delivered pursuant hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement
contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the
subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all other prior
representations, warranties, agreements, understandings or letters of intent
between or among any of the parties hereto or their respective Affiliates.
This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a
written instrument signed by Buyer and Dover US. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, _Section 10.2_ , _Section 12.15_ , _Section
12.16_ , _Section 12.18_ and this _Section 12.7_  (and any provision of this
Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of _Section 10.2_ , _Section 12.15_ ,
_Section 12.16_ , _Section 12.18_ and this _Section 12.7_ ) may not be
modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse in any material
respect to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the
Financing Sources. The Financing Sources shall be express third party
beneficiaries of and have the right to enforce _Section 10.2_ , _Section
12.15_ , _Section 12.16_ , _Section 12.18_ and this _Section 12.7_.

  



  

Section 12.8 _Interpretation_. Disclosure of any fact or item in any
Schedule hereto referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other section in this
Agreement so long as the applicability of such matter to such section is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. Neither the specification
of any dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is
intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use
the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such
item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement
specifically provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item or
matter in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply
that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the
ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting
forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not in the ordinary
course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.9 _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may
be waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or
parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any
party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such
party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision
of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor
in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the
right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No
waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall constitute a continuing waiver or
shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

Section 12.10 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein, each
party hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident to its negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement and to its performance and compliance with all
agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or
complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel
and independent public accountants.

  



  

Section 12.11 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each
provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions
contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof,
unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

  



  

Section 12.12 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original
instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties hereto and delivered to Sellers and Buyer.

  



  

Section 12.13 _Further Assurances_. On and after the Closing Date,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take or cause to be taken all action, to do or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations or otherwise to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable
best efforts to execute and deliver such instruments, and take such other
actions as the other party hereto may reasonably require in order to carry
out the intent of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in the event that after the Closing Date, Buyer and Dover US
determine and agree in writing that Sellers or DCF or any of their Affiliates
have retained any right, title or interest in or to any asset that is
necessary for the operation of the Business (other than assets provided
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement), then for no additional
consideration to Sellers or DCF, Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, transfer and assign all such right, title and interest in and
to such assets to the Acquired Companies or any other entity designated
by Buyer, and Sellers or DCF, as applicable, shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, execute all other documents and instruments, and take all
other lawful actions reasonably requested, in order to assign and transfer
such assets to an entity designated by Buyer.

Section 12.14 _Disclaimer of Warranties_. No Seller makes any
representations or warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts or
forward-looking information provided to Buyer. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SELLER ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR IP
ASSIGNMENTS, EACH SELLER IS SELLING THE APPLICABLE SHARES (AND THE BUSINESS
AND ASSETS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES REPRESENTED THEREBY) AND DCF SHALL
TRANSFER THE IP ASSETS ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND EACH SELLER DISCLAIMS
ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AND NO SELLER MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED
WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. Except as specifically referenced herein or in the
Schedules, Buyer acknowledges that no Seller nor any of Sellers' respective
representatives or Affiliates or any other Person has made any representation
or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
diligence materials heretofore made available by any Seller or any of its
representatives or Affiliates to Buyer, and no Seller nor any of
Sellers' respective representatives or Affiliates or any other Person will
have or be subject to any liability to Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any
other Person resulting from the distribution of any such information to, or
use of any such information by, Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any of their
agents, consultants, accountants, counsel or other representatives. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that it is not entitled to rely upon any
representations or warranties or other statements of fact or opinion, other
than the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or otherwise restrict the ability of the Buyer to bring,
or be used as a defense against, any claim against any Seller or its
Affiliates in the case of fraud.

  



  

Section 12.15 _Enforcement_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
irreparable damage may occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement to be performed by Buyer or Sellers are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly, prior to
any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_, Buyer and
Sellers, as applicable, shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by the other parties, as applicable, and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court
located in the Northern District of Illinois, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity.  Buyer and
Sellers hereby further waive (i) any defense in any Proceeding for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any Requirements
of Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. For
the avoidance of doubt, no party hereto shall be entitled to seek the remedy
of specific performance of this Agreement against the Financing Sources.

  



  

Section 12.16 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in any other documents delivered pursuant hereto, (i) this
Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Proceeding based upon,
arising out of or related to a breach of this Agreement by Sellers or Buyer
may only be made against, Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, (ii) none of either
party's Affiliates or such party's or their Affiliates' respective current,
former or future directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members, stockholders, assignees, Financing Sources or representatives
(collectively, the " _Related Parties_ ") shall have any liability in
connection with this Agreement or the Financing or any Proceeding in
connection therewith (whether in tort, contract or otherwise), and (iii)
Sellers and Buyer shall have no rights of recovery in respect of this
Agreement or the Financing against the other's Related Parties, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through any
Proceeding (whether in tort, contract or otherwise), by the enforcement of
any judgment, fine or penalty or by virtue of any statute, regulation or
other applicable Requirements of Law, or otherwise.

  



  

Section 12.17 _Time of the Essence_. The parties hereto hereby
expressly acknowledge and agree that time is of the essence for each and
every provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, with
respect to Sellers' obligations under _Section 7.7_  to deliver all
statements, documents and other materials and to provide all necessary
information and assistance) and that any delay in performance hereunder by
any party hereto will result in irreparable harm to the other parties hereto.

Section 12.18 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of
Jury Trial_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Requirements of Law (without regard to
principles of conflicts of law) of the State of New York. By the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer and each of the Sellers
submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the
Northern District of Illinois in any suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement. No party hereto, nor any of its Affiliates, will
bring, or support the bringing of, any claim, whether at law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source or
its Representatives in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute, claim or
cause of action arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing Commitments or the performance thereof, anywhere other than in (i)
any New York State court sitting in the County of New York or (ii) the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York. EACH OF THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE FINANCING
COMMITMENTS OR THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF.

  



  

Section 12.19 _Certain Matters regarding Representation of the
Acquired Companies and Seller_ _._

  



  

(a) The Law Department (" _Dover Legal_ ") of Parent, in concert
with certain outside counsel, including Sidley Austin LLP (" _Sidley_ ", and
collectively with Dover Legal, " _Sellers ' Counsel_"), has acted as
counsel for Parent, Sellers and the Acquired Companies (the " _Clients_ ")
for various matters prior to the Closing, including in connection with this
Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and the Seller Ancillary Agreements
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (the " _Pre-Closing
Engagements_ ") and in that connection not as counsel for any other
Person, including Buyer or its Affiliates. Only the Clients shall be
considered clients of Sellers' Counsel in the Pre-Closing
Engagements. Accordingly, notwithstanding that the Clients are or were
clients in the Pre-Closing Engagements, upon and after the Closing,
all communications between any of the Clients and Sellers' Counsel in the
course of the Pre-Closing Engagements shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to Parent and Sellers and not to any of the
Acquired Companies or Buyer, in each case so long as such communications
would be subject to a privilege or protection if they were being requested in
a Proceeding by an unrelated third party. Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) shall not have
access to any such communications, or to the files of Sellers' Counsel
relating to the Pre-Closing Engagements, whether or not the Closing shall
have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
notwithstanding that the Acquired Companies are or were clients in the Pre-
Closing Engagements, upon and after the Closing except with respect to any
communications that would not be subject to a privilege or protection if they
were being requested in a proceeding by an unrelated third party, (i)
Parent and Sellers shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege
with respect to the Pre-Closing Engagements, and none of the Acquired
Companies, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates shall be a holder
thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Sellers' Counsel in respect of the
Pre-Closing Engagements constitute property of the Clients (including the
Acquired Companies), only Parent and Sellers shall hold such property rights,
and (iii) Sellers' Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the Acquired
Companies, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Sellers' Counsel and the Acquired
Companies or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
parties recognize that it would be impracticable to try to purge all Client-
privileged communications from the Acquired Companies' files and computer
systems prior to the Closing, and so the parties agree that no waiver
is intended by leaving such documents where they are and Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not be permitted to review any such documents, and Buyer
agrees that it and its Affiliates shall not be permitted to use any such
documents in a manner adverse to Sellers in any indemnity or other dispute
following the Closing.

  



    

73 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) Upon and after the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall cease
to have any attorney-client relationship with Sellers' Counsel, unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent, Sellers and the Acquired Companies.

  



  

Section 12.20 _Guarantee_. RBC Parent hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees the full and complete payment and performance when
due of all Liabilities of Buyer to Sellers pursuant to this Agreement,
including the payment of the Purchase Price (all such Liabilities being the "
_Guaranteed Obligations_ "), and acknowledges and agrees that the guaranty
described in this _Section 12.20_ is a primary guaranty of performance and
not just of collection. RBC Parent agrees that if Buyer fails to make any
payment that is required to be made under this Agreement when due, such
amount shall for purposes hereof be deemed due and payable by RBC Parent upon
written notice from Sellers to RBC Parent demanding payment thereof. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, RBC Parent agrees that its
obligations under this _Section 12.20_ are independent from those of Buyer and
its liability shall extend to all Liabilities that constitute part of the
Guaranteed Obligations, irrespective of whether any Proceeding is brought
against Buyer or whether Buyer is joined in any such Proceeding. The
liability of RBC Parent under this _Section 12.20_ for the Guaranteed
Obligations shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and RBC
Parent hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now or hereafter have in
any way relating to, any lack of validity or enforceability of any Guaranteed
Obligation, any Liability guaranteed by the Guaranteed Obligations or any
agreement, instrument or Liability relating thereto. RBC Parent hereby waives
(a) notice of acceptance of the guaranty described in this _Section 12.20_ ;
(b) presentment and demand of the Guaranteed Obligations; and (c) any right
to require that any Proceeding be brought against Buyer or any other Person
prior to any Proceeding against RBC Parent under the terms of this Agreement.
