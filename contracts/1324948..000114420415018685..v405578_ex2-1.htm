<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 1in"><FONT STYLE="color: #010000">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>The
Law Department (&ldquo;<U>Dover Legal</U>&rdquo;) of Parent, in concert with certain outside counsel, including Sidley Austin LLP
(&ldquo;<U>Sidley</U>&rdquo;, and collectively with Dover Legal, &ldquo;<U>Sellers&rsquo; Counsel</U>&rdquo;), has acted as counsel
for Parent, Sellers and the Acquired Companies (the &ldquo;<U>Clients</U>&rdquo;) for various matters prior to the Closing, including
in connection with this Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and the Seller Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (the &ldquo;<U>Pre-Closing Engagements</U>&rdquo;) and in that connection not as counsel for any other Person,
including Buyer or its Affiliates. Only the Clients shall be considered clients of Sellers&rsquo; Counsel in the Pre-Closing Engagements.
Accordingly, notwithstanding that the Clients are or were clients in the Pre-Closing Engagements, upon and after the Closing, all
communications between any of the Clients and Sellers&rsquo; Counsel in the course of the Pre-Closing Engagements shall be deemed
to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to Parent and Sellers and not to any of the Acquired Companies or Buyer, in
each case so long as such communications would be subject to a privilege or protection if they were being requested in a Proceeding
by an unrelated third party. Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) shall not have access
to any such communications, or to the files of Sellers&rsquo; Counsel relating to the Pre-Closing Engagements, whether or not the
Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding that the Acquired Companies are
or were clients in the Pre-Closing Engagements, upon and after the Closing except with respect to any communications that would
not be subject to a privilege or protection if they were being requested in a proceeding by an unrelated third party, (i) Parent
and Sellers shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Pre-Closing Engagements, and none of
the Acquired Companies, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of
Sellers&rsquo; Counsel in respect of the Pre-Closing Engagements constitute property of the Clients (including the Acquired Companies),
only Parent and Sellers shall hold such property rights, and (iii) Sellers&rsquo; Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal
or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to the Acquired Companies, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates
by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Sellers&rsquo; Counsel and the Acquired Companies or otherwise. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the parties recognize that it would be impracticable to try to purge all Client-privileged communications
from the Acquired Companies&rsquo; files and computer systems prior to the Closing, and so the parties agree that no waiver is
intended by leaving such documents where they are and Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be permitted to review any such documents,
and Buyer agrees that it and its Affiliates shall not be permitted to use any such documents in a manner adverse to Sellers in
any indemnity or other dispute following the Closing.</P>

RBC Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the full and complete payment and performance when due of all Liabilities
of Buyer to Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, including the payment of the Purchase Price (all such Liabilities being the &ldquo;<U>Guaranteed
Obligations</U>&rdquo;), and acknowledges and agrees that the guaranty described in this <U>Section 12.20</U> is a primary guaranty
of performance and not just of collection. RBC Parent agrees that if Buyer fails to make any payment that is required to be made
under this Agreement when due, such amount shall for purposes hereof be deemed due and payable by RBC Parent upon written notice
from Sellers to RBC Parent demanding payment thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, RBC Parent agrees that
its obligations under this <U>Section 12.20</U> are independent from those of Buyer and its liability shall extend to all Liabilities
that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations, irrespective of whether any Proceeding is brought against Buyer or whether
Buyer is joined in any such Proceeding. The liability of RBC Parent under this <U>Section 12.20</U> for the Guaranteed Obligations
shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and RBC Parent hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now or hereafter
have in any way relating to, any lack of validity or enforceability of any Guaranteed Obligation, any Liability guaranteed by
the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement, instrument or Liability relating thereto. RBC Parent hereby waives (a) notice of
acceptance of the guaranty described in this <U>Section 12.20</U>; (b) presentment and demand of the Guaranteed Obligations; and
(c) any right to require that any Proceeding be brought against Buyer or any other Person prior to any Proceeding against RBC
Parent under the terms of this Agreement.</P>
