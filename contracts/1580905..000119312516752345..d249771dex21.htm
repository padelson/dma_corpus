SECTION 1

_SALE AND PURCHASE OF ACQUIRED SHARES_

1.1 _Sale and Purchase of Acquired Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing (as defined in
_Section 2.1_), the Sellers shall sell, transfer and deliver the Acquired
Shares to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase the Acquired Shares from the
Sellers free and clear of all Liens. 1.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Acquired Shares is
$92,120,000 (the " _Gross Purchase Price_ ") subject to adjustment pursuant
to this _Section 1.2_ and _Sections 1.3_ and _1.5_ (the " _Purchase Price_ ")
and shall be payable at the Closing as set forth below and in the flow of
funds that will be attached hereto as _Schedule 1.2_ at the Closing (the "
_Flow of Funds_ ").

(a) _Common Stock of IBP_. IBP will pay $9,212,000 of the Purchase Price on
Purchasers behalf by issuing a total of 282,577 shares of IBP common stock,
par value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), to the Individuals (per 
_Section 1.2(e)_) as evidenced by a copy of a letter delivered to American
Stock Transfer and Trust Company at the Closing instructing it to register
211,933 shares of the Common Stock in Vikas Vermas name and 70,644 shares
of Common Stock in Henry Schmueckles name (the " _AST Letter_ "), in each
case in book-entry record, including the restrictive legends provided in
_Section 9.4(b)_ (collectively, the " _IBP Shares_ ").

 

(b) _Holdback Amount_. Purchaser will retain $1,000,000 of the Purchase Price
to be held by Purchaser in escrow for the Equityholders obligations, if any,
under _Section 1.3_ (the " _Holdback Amount_ ").

(c) _Funded Indebtedness_. On behalf of each Company, Purchaser will pay in
full the Funded Indebtedness of such Company, if any, listed in the Flow of
Funds and pursuant to the Lien release documents delivered to Purchaser per
_Section 8.2(v)_;  _ _provided__ that any Funded Indebtedness in excess of
$350,000 will reduce the amount of the Closing Payment.

(d) _Cash at Closing_. After application of _Sections 1.2(a)_ through
_1.2(c)_ , Purchaser will pay and deliver to the Individuals the balance of
the Purchase Price for the Acquired Shares (the " _Closing Payment_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by each
Individual (per _Section 1.2(e)_) in the Flow of Funds (together, the "
_Individuals  Accounts_").

 

(e) _Payments to the Individuals_. Each of the Equityholders acknowledges and
agrees to the foregoing methodology and manner of payment of the Purchase
Price (including any Earn Out Amount), and the Sellers direct Purchaser and
IBP to make such payments, including via the issuance of the IBP Shares to the
Individuals and the Closing Payment to the Individuals Accounts, as
set forth above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that, for
Tax purposes, the Purchase Price (and any individual component thereof,
including the Earn Out Amount, if any) shall be deemed paid directly to the
Sellers as consideration for the Acquired Shares.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchase Price may be adjusted downward
pursuant to the terms of  _Section 11.8_.

1.3 _Post Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) Within 14 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Equityholders
Representative will: (i) agree on the amount of Closing Cash as of 11:59 p.m.
on the Closing Date; and (ii) prepare a balance sheet of the Companies (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ "), in a manner consistent with the balance sheet
included in the Companies 2015 Audited Financial Statements (as defined in
_Section 5.7_), an example of which is set forth on _Schedule 1.3_ , and
calculate and mutually agree upon what the Net Working Capital was as of 11:59
p.m. on the Closing Date.

 



2 (b) If the parties are unable to mutually agree on the amount of Closing Cash
or the Closing Balance Sheet during such 14-day period described above, then
the parties shall submit only the issues remaining in dispute to BDO
Consulting, a division of BDO USA, LLP, 100 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017,
attention: Jeffrey Katz (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") for resolution.
The parties shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Independent
Accountants such work papers and other documents and information relating to
the disputed issues as the Independent Accountants may request and are
reasonably available to that party or its agents without exercising undue
effort and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Independent
Accountants any material relating to the disputed issues and to discuss the
issues with the Independent Accountants. The determination by the Independent
Accountants, as set forth in a notice to be delivered to both Equityholders
Representative and Purchaser within 20 days of the submission to
the Independent Accountants of only the issues remaining in dispute, shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the parties enforceable in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The Equityholders, jointly and severally, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, will each bear 50% of the fees and
costs of the Independent Accountants for such determination.

(c) The amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital is less than
$15,000,000 is referred to herein as the " _Net Working Capital Deficiency
Amount_." The amount, if any, by which the Closing Cash is less than
$1,000,000 is referred to as the " _Cash Deficiency Amount_ " and together,
with the Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount, the " _Equityholder Deficiency
Amount_." The amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital is greater than
$15,000,000 is referred to herein as the " _Net Working Capital Surplus
Amount_."

(d) The Equityholder Deficiency Amount or the Net Working Capital Surplus
Amount, as applicable, shall be paid within three days of the final
determination of the Equityholder Deficiency Amount or Net Working Capital
Surplus Amount, as applicable. For purposes of clarity, the parties intend
that only one payment be made, e.g., if the Net Working Capital Surplus
Amount __less__ the Equityholder Deficiency Amount is a positive amount, only
the Individuals shall be paid pursuant to this Section. The Equityholder
Deficiency Amount shall be paid in cash by the Equityholders to Purchaser,
first by distribution from the Holdback Amount of an amount equal to the
Equityholder Deficiency Amount, and, if the Equityholder Deficiency Amount
exceeds the Holdback Amount, then such excess will be the joint and several
obligation of the Equityholders and be payable in full to Purchaser within the
time period set forth above. Per _Section 1.2(e)_, the Net Working Capital
Surplus Amount will be allocated among the Acquired Shares and the
Individuals in the same percentages as the Closing Payment is allocated among
such Acquired Shares and the Individuals and be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Individuals Accounts.

 

(e) For Tax purposes, the Equityholder Deficiency Amount, if any, shall be
treated as a decrease in the Purchase Price, and the Net Working Capital
Surplus Amount, if any, shall be treated as an increase in the Purchase Price
and shall, in each case, be allocated among the Acquired Shares and the
Sellers in the same percentages as the Closing Payment is allocated among the
Acquired Shares and the Sellers.

1.4 _Release of Holdback Amount_. The Holdback Amount, net of any deductions
pursuant to  _Section 1.3_, will be allocated among the Acquired Shares and
the Individuals in the same percentages as the Closing Payment is allocated
among such Acquired Shares and the Individuals and be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Individuals Accounts promptly following
the completion of the post-Closing adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.3_.

 



3 1.5 _Earn Out_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 1.5_, Purchaser will
pay to the Individuals, as additional Purchase Price for the Acquired Shares,
an amount equal to three times the amount, if any, by which the total EBITDA
for the 2016 fiscal year for the Companies (the " _2016 EBITDA_ ") exceeds
$15,655,477 (the " _Earn Out Amount_ ").

 

(b) To determine the 2016 EBITDA amount, Purchasers independent public
accountants will calculate, in accordance with GAAP and consistent with the
same manner in which the Companies 2015 Audited Financial Statements were
prepared, the EBITDA of each of the Companies for its 2016 fiscal year and the
sum of the total EBITDA of the Companies for their 2016 fiscal year. Such
calculations will be undertaken promptly after the Closing, and a copy of such
final calculations will be provided to Purchaser and Equityholders
Representative by such accountants (such final calculations being referred to
as, the " _Auditor s Report_"). The parties agree that the costs incurred by
the Companies in 2016 that are solely related to: (i) the Companies responses
to the due diligence requests of Purchaser; (ii) the restatement of the
Companies financials at Purchasers request; and (iii) preparing to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Pre-
Closing Reorganization, which costs will be set forth on _Schedule 1.5_
and attached hereto at the Closing, shall not be deducted from the Companies
earnings for purposes of calculating the 2016 EBITDA.

(c) Following the receipt by Equityholders Representative of the Auditors
Report, Purchaser shall permit Equityholders Representative reasonable access
during normal business hours to the books and records pertaining to the
preparation of the Auditors Report and provide Equityholders Representative
with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by Equityholders Representative)
and such additional information as Equityholders Representative may
reasonably request to confirm the Earn Out Amount. The Equityholders agree
that the scope of such audit shall be reasonable and as is customary in
transactions of this kind. All costs and fees incurred by the parties related
to the exercise of the audit right shall be borne by each of the respective
parties. If the parties fail to mutually agree on the Earn Out Amount after 30
days following the receipt of the Auditors Report by Equityholders
Representative, then the parties shall submit the issues then-remaining in
dispute to the Independent Accountants to be decided in accordance with
_Section 1.3(b)_.

(d) The Earn Out Amount, if any, will be allocated among the Acquired Shares,
in the same ratio that each of the following bear to the combined EBITDA of
all of the Companies as shown in the Auditors Report: (i) the combined EBITDA
of Trilok and Alpha as shown in the Auditors Report; and (ii) the EBITDA of
Alpha Company as shown in the Auditors Report. The Earn Out Amount as so
allocated in the immediately preceding sentence, will be allocated among the
Acquired Shares and the Individuals in the same percentages as the Closing
Payment is allocated among the Acquired Shares and the Individuals, and be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Individuals
Accounts (per _Section 1.2(e)_) within three days of the final determination
of such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that, for Tax
purposes, the Earn Out Amount, if any, shall be deemed paid directly to the
Sellers as consideration for the Acquired Shares.

included on the Closing Balance Sheet will be attached to this Agreement by
Purchaser and Equityholders Representative as _Schedule 5.10_ (collectively,
the " _Accounts Receivable_ ") as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later
than the date the Closing Balance Sheet is determined pursuant to _Section
1.3_. All of the Accounts Receivable arose in the Ordinary Course of Business,
subject to no defenses, offsets or counterclaims, and reflect goods actually
sold and delivered or services rendered in the Ordinary Course of Business of
each Company. None of the Accounts Receivable are obligations of any of the
Equityholders, or any of the Companies respective employees, Service
Providers, managers, officers or directors, or any of their respective
Affiliates. To the Equityholders Knowledge, the Accounts Receivable are
current and collectible in accordance with the terms thereof and at the full
face amount thereof, net of "bad debt" reserves shown on the Closing Balance
Sheet (which reserves are adequate and calculated in a manner consistent with
the past accounting practices of the Companies). None of the Accounts
Receivable represent obligations for goods sold on consignment, on approval or
on a sale-or-return basis or subject to any other repurchase or return
arrangement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Accounts
Receivable that are included in the calculation of the Net Working Capital
either have been or will be collected in full, without any set-off, within
365 days after the Closing Date, subject to the "bad debt" reserves shown on
the Closing Balance Sheet.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.10(a)_, the parties acknowledge that certain
of the Accounts Receivable relate to retainage amounts held by the Companies
customers pending completion of the applicable project or development (each,
a " _Retainage Amount_ "). The Retainage Amounts will be identified as such
in _Schedule 5.10_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
the Retainage Amounts will be collected in full, without any set-off,
within 545 days after the Closing Date.

2003, each Company has complied and is currently in compliance in all
material respects with all Applicable Law, including, but not limited to,
employment laws and Environmental Laws, and no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that could give rise to or serve as a basis for a notice,
claim, charge or complaint regarding noncompliance. All notices, claims,
charges and/or complaints received by any Company since October 1, 2013
alleging any noncompliance are set forth on _Schedule 5.11_ , and none of the
scheduled notices, claims, charges and/or complaints remains uncured.

12  Equityholders Knowledge, all of such licenses, permits and authorizations
are in full force and effect and will not terminate as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. No violation or
remedial obligation exists in respect of any such license, permit or
authorization. No proceeding is pending, or to the Equityholders Knowledge,
threatened to revoke or limit any such license, permit or authorization, nor
is there any basis upon which any such proceeding could be based.

currently no, and since October 1, 2013 there has been no, claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding pending or, to the Equityholders Knowledge,
threatened by or against any Company, including, without limitation, claims

Equityholders Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that
could give rise to or serve as a basis for any such claims,
litigation, investigations or proceedings. There are no pending or, to the
Equityholders Knowledge, threatened Employee Claims against any Company, nor
to the Equityholders Knowledge is there any basis upon which any Employee
Claims against any Company could be based, and no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that may give rise to or serve as a basis for any Employee
Claims against any Company. There are no writs, judgments, orders, decrees,
injunctions or similar orders of any Governmental Authority (in each case

any additional Taxes could be assessed. No examination, audit, dispute or
claim respecting any Companys Tax Returns or Tax liability has occurred, is
in progress, or to the Equityholders Knowledge, is being proposed, threatened
or discussed, including, without limitation, any claim by any Taxing Authority
in a jurisdiction where a Company does not file Tax Returns that such Company
is or may be subject to taxation by, or required to file any Tax Return in,
that jurisdiction. Each Company, has disclosed on its Tax Returns all
positions taken that could give rise to a substantial understatement of

relationships with its material customers and suppliers. _Schedule 5.15_ sets
forth the 20 largest customers and the 10 largest suppliers of each Company
(and the dollar volumes related thereto), in each case for the 12-month period
ended September 30, 2016. None of the current suppliers or customers of any
Companys services, supplies or products has notified such Company that it
intends to terminate or otherwise substantially modify its relationship with

its usage or purchase of the services and products of such Company, and to the
Equityholders Knowledge, none of such suppliers and customers have any such
intent.

behalf, has directly or indirectly given or agreed to give any gift or
similar benefit to any customer, supplier, governmental employee or other
Person who is in a position to help or hinder such Companys business which:
(a) might subject such Company to any suit, damage or penalty in any private
or governmental litigation or proceeding; (b) if not given in the past, might
have resulted in a Material Adverse Change to such Company; or (c) if not
continued in the future, might constitute a Material Adverse Change for such
Company.

5.18 _Intellectual Property_. _Schedule 5.18_ lists (a) all Intellectual
Property Rights owned or used by each Company or in which it has any rights or
licenses, indicating in each instance which of such Intellectual Property
Rights is owned or used under an oral or written license Contract; and (b)
any federal or state registrations or applications that each Company has with
respect to such Intellectual Property Rights. Each Company has such rights of

the source code for all proprietary components of the software program called
" _Collaborate_ " (including all source code, object code, application
programming interfaces, data files, databases, protocols, specifications and
other related documentation and materials) (the " _Program_ "). No Company has
disclosed, delivered, licensed or otherwise made available, and does not have
a duty or obligation (whether present, contingent or otherwise) to disclose,
deliver, license or otherwise make available, any source code for the Program
to any other Person, and Alpha is the sole owner of all rights, title and
interest in and to such source code. To the Equityholders Knowledge, as of
the date hereof, there has been no unauthorized

 



15  theft, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling or other unauthorized
disclosure of or access to any material portion of the source code for the
Program. Except as set forth in _Schedule 5.18_ , no Company has interfered
with, infringed upon or misappropriated any Intellectual Property Rights of
any other Person, and no Company has received any claim or notice alleging
such action, and each Company has the exclusive right to use such
Intellectual Property Rights (other than off-the-shelf software purchased for
use in a Companys day-to-day operations). None of the Intellectual Property
Rights have been used, divulged or appropriated for the benefit of any past
or present employees or any other Person, and no Company has granted any
license or sublicense of any rights under or with respect to its Intellectual
Property Rights.

summary of all material plan terms if the plan is not in writing); (ii) the

regulations, and, in all material respects, with the applicable requirements

Plan or to provide benefits to retirees or persons who are not current
employees and their dependents, other than as required under Code §4980B and
any similar state regulations. 

(d) Each Benefit Plan: (i) is, and since October 1, 2011 has been, in
compliance, in all material respects, in form and operation with (and in all
material respects has been administered in compliance with) all requirements
of ERISA, the Code and Applicable Law, including all requirements to receive
any tax-advantaged treatment intended for such Benefit Plan or available to

actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits) with
respect to any Benefit Plan or the administration thereof, nor has any event
occurred that could give rise to such a claim. There have been no prohibited
transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on
"fiduciaries" (within the meaning of §3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect
to any Benefit Plan that could result in any material liability or excise Tax
under ERISA or the Code being imposed on any Company.

 

(f) Each Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under §401(a) of the Code has
heretofore been determined by the IRS to be so qualified or is based upon a

prototype or volume submitter plan has received a favorable opinion letter
from the IRS, and each trust created thereunder has heretofore been determined
by the IRS to be exempt from Tax under the provisions of §501(a) of the Code,
and no events have occurred since the date of the most recent favorable IRS
determination letter or favorable IRS opinion letter that could reasonably be
expected to result in the loss of such tax-qualified status. Each Benefit
Plan intended to be qualified under §401(a) of the Code has been audited by a
certified public accountant on an annual basis and no exceptions have been
noted by the auditor.

 



17 (g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in combination with
another event (whether contingent or otherwise) will, with respect to any
employee, manager, officer, director or other Service Provider of any Company
or any of its respective Subsidiaries: (i) entitle any such individual to any
payment; (ii) increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any such
individual; (iii) accelerate the vesting, funding or time of payment of any
compensation, equity award or other benefit to any such individual; or (iv)
result in any payments to any such individual under an Benefit Plan not being
deductible by reason of Code §280G or subject to tax under Code §4999\. No
Company or any Subsidiary of a Company has made a commitment to any employee,
Service Provider, manager, officer, director or consultant to make such person
fully or partially whole with respect to any adverse Tax consequences relating
to any Benefit Plan matters, including, without limitation, the foregoing
items or Code §409A.

(h) Each Benefit Plan that constitutes in any part a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan within the meaning of §409A of the Code (or that
would be but for an exemption thereunder) has satisfied in all material
respects §409A of the Code (or such exemption) in form and operation. No
Company or any Affiliate of a Company has any obligation to provide any
"gross-up" or similar payment to any employee to reimburse him or her for
Taxes or penalties associated with such employees coverage by, or benefits
under, any Benefit Plan, including, without limitation, under §§409A or 4999
of the Code.

(i) Each Company and its respective Affiliates have retained the right
to unilaterally amend, terminate or merge each Benefit Plan and any benefits
thereunder to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.

 

(j) No Company or any of its respective employees are parties to, or covered
by, nor is any Benefit Plan, a multiple employer plan, including, without
limitation, a Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement as defined in §3(40) of
ERISA.

5.23 _Employment Matters_.  _Schedule 5.23_ contains a list of the name of
each employee and Service Provider used by each Company, together with such
Persons: (i) position or function; (ii) classification (iii) annual base
salary, wages or other means of compensation; (iv) accrued vacations and
vacation pay, holiday pay and sick pay (accrued and total); and (v) incentive
or bonus arrangement (accrued and total). To the Equityholders Knowledge, no
employee or Service Provider plans to terminate employment with the
applicable Company following the Closing. To the Equityholders Knowledge, no
employee or Service Provider is bound by a nondisclosure or noncompetition
covenant that restricts or affects such Persons employment with the
applicable Company. All of each Companys employees and Service Providers may
be terminated at any time with or without cause without the payment of
severance or other liability. No Company is and has not been a party to any
collective bargaining or other labor Contract. With respect to each Company,
there is not now existing or, to the Equityholders Knowledge, threatened, and
has not since October 1, 2013 been: (a) any strike, slowdown, picketing, work
stoppage or employee grievance process; (b) any proceeding relating to the
alleged violation of any Applicable Law pertaining to labor relations or
employment matters; or (c) any application for certification of a collective
bargaining agent. No event has occurred or circumstance exists that could
provide the basis for any work stoppage or other labor dispute. Each Company
has complied in all material respects with all Applicable Law relating to 

 



18  employment, equal employment opportunity, nondiscrimination, immigration,
hiring, wages, hours, benefits, collective bargaining, the payment of social
security and other employment Taxes, occupational safety and health, workers
compensation and plant closing. No Company is liable for the payment of any
compensation, damages, Taxes, fines, penalties or other amounts, however
designated, for failure to comply with any Applicable Law. No Company has
received since October 1, 2011 any notice from any Governmental Authority that
any of its employees or Service Providers has a name or Social Security Number
that does not match the name or Social Security Number maintained by such
Governmental Authority, and all employees and Service Providers are legally
authorized to work in the United States. Since October 1, 2012, each Company
has properly classified all of its employees (including, without limitation,
as salaried, hourly and/or exempt or non-exempt) for all compensation and
benefit purposes and for all Applicable Law. Since October 1, 2012, each
Company has paid or accrued all wages and compensation due to Service
Providers and employees, including vacations and vacation pay, holiday pay,
sick pay and bonuses. The employees and Service Providers listed on _Schedule
5.23_ are sufficient for the continued conduct of each Companys business
after the Closing in substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the
Closing.

5.24 _Inventory_. The breakdown of the Companies supplies, materials, work
in process and finished goods inventory that are included on the Closing
Balance Sheet (the " _Inventory_ ") will be attached to this Agreement by
Purchaser and Equityholders Representative as _Schedule 5.24_  as soon as
reasonably practicable, but no later than the date the Closing Balance Sheet
is determined pursuant to _Section 1.3_. The Inventory is free of material
defect, is of a quality and quantity usable and salable in the
Ordinary Course of Business except for obsolete items, which have been
written off or written down to net realizable value in the Closing Balance
Sheet. _Schedule 5.24_ contains a true and correct listing of all Inventory.
The Inventory not written off has been priced at the lower of cost or market
value. The Inventory is not excessive in the present circumstances of business
of each Company and can be used or consumed in the Ordinary Course of Business
of such Company. Each item included in the Inventory is the property of the
applicable Company identified on the Closing Balance Sheet and is not held by
such Company on consignment from others, and is otherwise free and clear of
any Lien except for such Liens as shall be fully released and cancelled as of
the Closing Date.

5.25 _Insurance_. _Schedule 5.25_ lists all insurance policies presently
maintained by any Company, showing the issuer, types of coverage, policy
expiration dates, current premiums, policy numbers and policy limits as to
each such policy. All such policies are in full force and effect, have been
obtained in compliance with all legal and applicable insurance company
requirements, and no Company is in default with respect to its obligations
under such policies. Complete and correct copies of such policies and loss
runs related thereto for the calendar years 2011-2016 have been
made available to Purchaser. Each Company has been covered since October 1,
2004 by insurance in scope and amount customary and reasonable in its
industry. There are no pending claims against any Company for personal
injuries, product liability, property or other damage under any insurance
policy heretofore or presently issued to a Company, or any claims as to which
coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the insurer or in respect
of which the insurer has reserved its rights. No Company has any self
insurance arrangements, other than deductibles under the insurance policies
listed on _Schedule 5.25_.

 



19 5.26 _Real and Personal Property_.

acknowledges having received such information as he/it deems necessary to
enable him/it, to make the decision to enter into the transactions

distribution thereof, except pursuant to sales registered under
the Securities Act or under an exemption from such registration and in
compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws, and the
Individual does not have a present arrangement to effect any distribution of

that he must bear the economic risk of this investment in the IBP Shares
indefinitely, and is able to bear such risk and is able to afford a complete
loss of such investment.

 

6.11 _Access to Information_. The Individual acknowledges that he has reviewed
the Disclosure Materials and all other materials the Individual deemed
necessary for the purpose of making an investment decision with respect to the
IBP Shares, and, at a reasonable time prior to the Closing, has been afforded:

to receive answers from, representatives of IBP concerning IBPs business,
management and financial affairs and terms and conditions of the issuance of
the IBP Shares and the merits and risks of investing in the IBP Shares; (b)
access to information about IBP and its subsidiaries and their respective
financial condition, results of operations, business, properties, management
and prospects sufficient to enable him to evaluate his investment; and (c)
the opportunity to obtain such additional information that IBP possesses or
can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to make
an informed investment decision with respect to his investment in the IBP
Shares. The Individual has evaluated the risks of investing in the IBP
Shares, understands there are substantial risks of loss incidental to the

or suitability of the investment in the IBP Shares nor have such authorities
passed upon or endorsed the merits of the issuance of the IBP Shares.

 

6.13 _Restricted Securities_. The Individual understands that the IBP Shares
are characterized as "restricted securities" under the U.S. federal
securities laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from IBP in a transaction
not involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable
regulations such securities may be resold without registration under
the Securities Act only in certain limited circumstances.

6.14 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 5_, this _Section 6_

of the IBP Shares.

 

SECTION 7

_REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE EQUITYHOLDERS_

_REGARDING THE SELLERS AND THE PRE-CLOSING REORGANIZATION_

 

The Equityholders, jointly and severally, represent, warrant and covenant to
Purchaser as follows:

 

7.1 _Organization and Authority_. Each Seller is a limited liability company
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Georgia. Each Seller has full power and authority to execute, deliver
and perform its obligations under this Agreement and each of the Transaction
Documents to be executed and delivered by it in connection herewith, and
such execution, delivery and performance by such Seller has been approved by
all necessary organizational action. Each Seller has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement, and it constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of such Seller, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with
its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by the Equitable
Exceptions. When each other Transaction Document to which each such Seller is
or will be a party has been duly executed and delivered by such Seller
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party
thereto), such Transaction Document will constitute a legal and binding
obligation of such Seller enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except as enforceability may be limited by the Equitable Exceptions.

7.2 _Capitalization_. _Schedule 6.4_ sets forth the total authorized Capital
Stock of each Seller and the record ownership of such Capital Stock. The
issued and outstanding Capital Stock of each Seller: (a) is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable; (b) has been issued
in compliance with Applicable Law; and (c) has been issued in compliance with
applicable preemptive, preferential or contractual rights. There are no
outstanding options, subscriptions, warrants, convertible securities, purchase
rights, preemptive rights, conversion rights, redemption rights, buy-sell
rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights, agreements or undertakings
in effect or committed to by either Seller or the Individuals relating to the
Capital Stock of either Seller, and there is no commitment or agreement to
grant or issue any such right, agreement or undertaking. There are no
outstanding equity appreciation, phantom equity, profit participation or
similar rights held by any Person with respect to either Seller. There are no
irrevocable proxies, voting trusts, equityholders agreement or similar
Contract with respect to the exercise of the voting power of either Seller.
There is no obligation, contingent or otherwise, of either Seller to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of such Sellers Capital Stock.
There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the
right to vote (or that are convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities
having the right to vote) on any matters on which equityholders of the
applicable Seller are entitled to vote.

 



25 7.3 _Pre-Closing Reorganization_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Individuals
will contribute all of the Trilok Shares to PREEM I and the Alpha Company
Shares to PREEM II. Thereafter, PREEM I and PREEM II will make an election to
treat each of Trilok and Alpha Company, respectively, as a "qualified
subchapter S subsidiary" within the meaning of §1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code
(the " _Pre-Closing Reorganization_ ").

7.4 _Business Operations_. Neither Seller has any nor has ever had any
employees, Service Providers, Benefit Plans or business operations of any
type. Since its formation, each Sellers sole business has been limited to act
as a shell holding company (and following the Pre-Closing Reorganization, as
the beneficial and record owner of its portion of the Acquired Shares as
provided in _Section 7.3_).

 

7.5 _Ownership of Acquired Shares_. Following the consummation of the Pre-
Closing Reorganization and as of the Closing Date: (a) PREEM I will be the
sole legal, record and beneficial owner of, and have good and valid title to,
the Trilok Shares free and clear of any restriction on transfer (other than
under federal and state securities laws), Lien or adverse claim thereon; and
(b) PREEM II will be the sole legal, record and beneficial owner of, and have
good and valid title to, the Alpha Company Shares free and clear of any

Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement, Purchaser will receive valid
title to the Acquired Shares, free and clear of all Liens and adverse claims.
No Equityholder is a party to any option, warrant, right, Contract or other
agreement or commitment granting him or it the right to acquire, directly or
indirectly, additional Capital Stock of any Company or either Seller. Trilok
is the sole legal, record and beneficial owner of, and has good and valid
title to, all of the outstanding Capital Stock of Alpha free and clear of any
restriction on transfer (other than under federal and state securities laws),
Lien or adverse claim thereon.

 

7.6 _Tax Status_. Each Seller has been a validly electing S corporation within
the meaning of §§1361 and 1362 of the Code at all times during its existence.
Comparable elections, where and as available, have been made with state and
local Governmental Authorities with respect to each Seller and remain valid.
Following the consummation of the Pre-Closing Reorganization, Trilok and
Alpha Company will each become a "qualified subchapter S subsidiary" within
the meaning of §1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code and will each remain a "qualified
subchapter S subsidiary" through the Closing.

conduct of the businesses of the Companies. Purchaser and its representatives
will not contact any of the employees, Service Providers, landlords, customers
or suppliers of the Companies without the prior written consent

nature or not generally known to the public with respect to this Agreement (or
the transactions contemplated herein), Purchaser or IBP (" _Confidential
Information_ "), which any of their respective officers, managers, directors,
employees, counsel or accountants, may now possess or may hereafter create or
obtain, and such Confidential Information shall not be published, disclosed
or made accessible by any of them to any other Person or entity or used by any
of them, __provided__ , __however__ , that such party may disclose or use any
such information: (i) as has become generally available to the public other
than through a breach of this Agreement by such party or any of its Affiliates
or representatives; (ii) as becomes available to such party on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than any other party hereto or such
other partys Affiliates or representatives; __provided__ that such source is

(iv) as may be required to obtain any Governmental Authority approval or
consent required in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or (v) as may be necessary to establish such partys rights under
this Agreement; __provided__ , __further__ , __however__ , that in any case,
the Person intending to disclose Confidential Information will promptly notify
the party to whom it is obliged to keep such information confidential and, to
the extent practicable, provide such party a reasonable opportunity to prevent
public disclosure of such information. In the event the transactions
contemplated hereby are not consummated and this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_, each party hereto shall return all confidential
materials to the appropriate other party or destroy such confidential
materials (and certify in writing the destruction thereof) exchanged in
connection with this Agreement; __provided__ that each party shall be
permitted to retain a copy of the confidential materials pursuant to any legal
or regulatory requirement or document retention policy (whether relating to
written documents or to the back-up storage of electronic data). Each party
acknowledges responsibility for disclosures caused by such party and any of
its respective Affiliates and representatives.

 



32 (d) _Satisfaction of Closing Conditions_ ; _HSR_.

 

(i) During the Pre-Closing Period and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each Equityholder and Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or cause
to be done all things necessary under the terms of this Agreement or under
Applicable Law to cause the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in 
_Section 8_ and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

Equityholders, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall: (x)
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to comply as
expeditiously as possible with all requests of any Governmental Authority for
additional information and documents, including, without limitation,
information or documents requested under the HSR Act or other applicable
antitrust regulation; (y) not (A) extend any waiting period under the HSR Act
or any applicable antitrust regulation or (B) enter into any agreement with

the HSR Filing and accompanying documents, and routine communications with the
FTC or DOJ regarding the form or completeness of the HSR Filing) with, any
Governmental Authority or private party regarding any such filings or any
such transaction, (B) not participating in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority or private party in respect of any such filings,

notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by such

such meeting or discussion, and (C) to the extent permissible under Applicable
Law, consulting with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, proposals
or any other

 



33  substantive communication made or submitted by or on behalf of any party
hereto relating to any such filings or any such transaction; __provided__ ,
__however__ , that neither the Companies nor Purchaser shall be required to

litigation or any administrative or legislative action, or incur any other
material obligations in order to comply with this _Section 9.1(d)_.

 

(e) _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated:

 

(i) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Equityholders Representative
at any time prior to the Closing;

 

(ii) by Purchaser or Equityholders Representative, upon written notice to the
other party, if a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction has issued
an order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order has become
final and non-appealable; __provided_ , _however__ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)(ii)_ shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results
in or causes such order;

 

(iii) by (A) Purchaser if it is not then in breach of its obligations under
this Agreement that would entitle the Equityholders to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(e)(iii)(B)_ and (1) there is a
breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
the Equityholders set forth in this Agreement or (2) any of
the representations or warranties of the Equityholders shall have become
untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(c)_
would not be satisfied and, in either case, such breach or inaccuracy is not
waived or cured on or before the End Date (as defined below); or (B)
Equityholders Representative if none of the Equityholders are then in breach
of their respective obligations under this Agreement that would entitle
Purchaser to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section
9.1(e)(iii)(A)_ and (1) there is a breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of Purchaser or IBP set forth in this
Agreement or (2) any of the representations or warranties of Purchaser or IBP
shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.3(a)_ would not be satisfied and, in either case, such breach or
inaccuracy is not waived or cured on or before the End Date;

(iv) by Purchaser or Equityholders Representative, if the Closing has not
occurred (other than through the failure of any party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on
or before the date that is 120 days following the date of this Agreement ("
_End Date_ "), __provided__ ,  _ _however_ ,_ that if all applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act have not expired by such date, then Purchaser or
Equityholders Representative shall provide the other, as applicable, with a
written election extending the End Date an additional 45 days. For the
avoidance of doubt, if (A) all of the conditions to closing set forth in
_Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ have been satisfied at or prior to the End Date,
Purchaser may not utilize this  _Section 9.1(e)(iv)_ to terminate this
Agreement, and (B) all of the conditions to closing set forth in _Sections
8.1_ and _8.3_ have been satisfied at or prior to the End Date, the
Equityholders Representative may not utilize this _Section 9.1(e)(iv)_ to
terminate this Agreement.

 



34 If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_, then all
provisions of this Agreement shall thereupon become void without any
liability on the part of any party hereto to any other party hereto __except__
that a partys liability for a breach of any provision of this Agreement that
results in the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_
and the provisions of _Section 13_ shall survive any such termination.

 

(f) _Updating of Schedules_. During the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing, if an Equityholder determines that any fact,
condition or event arising after the date hereof would have constituted a
breach of any representation or warranty in _Section 5_, _Section 6_ or
_Section 7_ if such fact, condition or event arose prior to the date hereof
(or, in the case of any representations or warranties relating to the Pre-
Closing Reorganization, untrue as of the Closing Date), Equityholders
Representative shall deliver to Purchaser an update to the Schedules
specifying such fact, condition or event (a " _Schedule Update_ "). No
Schedule Update shall be deemed to have amended the Schedules, to have
qualified the relevant representations and warranties contained in the
Agreement or to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of representation
or warranty.

(g) _Pre-Closing Publicity_. During the Pre-Closing Period, any
public disclosures or announcements relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby will be made only upon consent in writing by
Equityholders Representative and Purchaser, or as may be required by
Applicable Law or by any Governmental Authority or the rules of any stock
exchange or trading system.

(h) _No Solicitation of Other Bids_.

 

(i) No Equityholder shall, or shall authorize or permit any of its Affiliates
(including any Company) or any of its or their representatives to, directly
or indirectly: (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue
inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal (as defined below); (ii) enter
into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to,
any Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into
any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an

reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the
identity of the Person making the same.

 



35 (iii) Each Equityholder agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance
with this  _Section 9.1(h)_ shall include having such provision specifically
enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and
agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable
injury to Purchaser and IBP and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to Purchaser and IBP.

9.2 _Termination of Rights of First Refusal and Similar Rights_. With respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Equityholder hereby
waives the applicability of, and the rights such Equityholder had, has or may
have under or pursuant to, each Companys Charter Documents with respect to
any buy-sell, preemptive right, right of first refusal or similar rights.

9.3 _Equityholders  Release_. Effective upon the Closing, each Equityholder,
on behalf of himself/itself and his/its respective Affiliates, and each of
their respective successors and assigns (each, a " _Releasing Party_ "), and
in his/its capacity as an equityholder and/or officer, director or employee
of each Company, hereby releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, each Company, Purchaser and their respective
Affiliates, employees, officers, directors and equityholders (each, a "
_Released Party_ ") of, from and against any and all actions, causes of
action, claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits of every
kind, nature and description whatsoever, which such Releasing Party ever had,
now has or may have on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever
arising on or prior to the Closing Date, including, without limitation, the
allocation of the Purchase Price among each of the Individuals and the total
consideration paid to the equityholders of the Companies that are subject to
the LOI Transactions; _ _provided__ , __however__ , that this release does not
extend to any claim: (a) for accrued benefits under employee benefit plans to
which such Releasing Party may be entitled or for any unpaid salary, expense
reimbursement or any similar employee-related benefits for the period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date; (b) arising under or pursuant to
any employment-related agreement entered into between a Company and such
Releasing Party; and (c) to enforce such Releasing Partys rights under this
Agreement. Each Releasing Party has not assigned any such claims to any third
party prior to the date hereof and will not assign any such claims after the
date hereof. Each Releasing Party agrees not to, and agrees to cause, as
applicable, his/its Affiliates and each of their respective successors and
assigns, not to, assert any such claims against the Released Parties.

(a) _Covenant Not To Sue_. The Releasing Parties shall not, and no one on
their behalf shall, assert or file any claim, complaint, charge, suit or
action against any Released Party arising out of any matter released pursuant
to this _Section 9.3_. In the event that any claim, complaint, charge, suit
or action is asserted or filed against a Released Party in breach hereof,
such Released Party shall be entitled to recover its costs, fees or expenses,
including reasonable attorney fees and costs at trial and on appeal, incurred
in defending against such action from the Releasing Party. 

(b) _Additional Facts_. The Releasing Parties acknowledge that they may
hereafter discover facts different from, or in addition to, those which they

this _Section 9.3_, and no such additional fact shall affect the validity or
enforceability of the releases contained in this  _Section 9.3_.

 



36 (c) _Investigation_. The Releasing Parties acknowledge that they are fully
informed and aware of their rights to receive independent legal advice
regarding the advisability of the releases contemplated hereby and have

the advisability thereof. The Releasing Parties further acknowledge that
they: (i) have made an investigation of the facts pertaining to the releases
contemplated hereby as they have deemed necessary; and (ii) have not relied
upon any statement or representation of others.

 

9.4 _Transfer Restrictions_

 

(a) Each Individual acknowledges and understands that: (i) the IBP Shares may
only be disposed of in compliance with state and federal securities laws; and
(ii) in connection with any transfer of IBP Shares other than pursuant to an
effective registration statement or Rule 144, to IBP, IBP may require the
transferor thereof to provide to IBP an opinion of counsel selected by the
transferor and reasonably acceptable to IBP, the form and substance of which
opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to IBP, to the effect that such
transfer does not require registration of such transferred IBP Shares under
the Securities Act. Any transfer or purported transfer of the IBP Shares in
violation of this _Section 9.4_ shall be void.

(b) Each Individual agrees to the book entry notation or the imprinting, so
long as is required by this _Section 9.4_, of a legend on any of the IBP
Shares (and any certificates or instruments representing the IBP Shares) in
substantially the following form: 

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
"SECURITIES ACT"), OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND, ACCORDINGLY,
MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM,
OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR BLUE
SKY LAWS.

9.5 _Furnishing of Information_. Until the date that any Individual owning IBP
Shares may sell all of them without restriction under Rule 144 of the
Securities Act (or any successor provision), IBP covenants to use its
reasonable best efforts to timely file (or obtain extensions in respect
thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to
be filed by IBP after the date hereof pursuant to the Exchange Act.

9.6 _Securities Laws Disclosure_ ; _Publicity_. In accordance with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, IBP shall cause a Current Report on Form 8-K
relating to the issuance of the IBP Shares under this Agreement to be
transmitted to the SEC for filing, which Form 8-K will disclose the material
terms of the transactions contemplated hereby, and attach forms of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents thereto (as required).

9.7  _Post-Closing Cooperation_. After the Closing, each Individual shall
provide such assistance as Purchaser may reasonably request with respect to
the preparation by Purchaser of consolidated financial statements of the
Companies and pro forma financial statements (if any) of Purchaser required
to be filed by Purchaser with the SEC that include or relate to any periods

 



37  ending on or before the Closing Date, at Purchasers sole expense. In
addition, each Individual shall cooperate fully, and to the extent reasonably
requested by Purchaser and the Companies, in connection with the Companies
preparation of any federal, state or local regulatory or other financial
reporting requirements subsequent to the Closing (including by the provision
of reasonably relevant records or information) that relate in whole or in
part to any periods prior to the Closing Date, at Purchasers sole expense.
Subsequent to the Closing, each Individual, upon the reasonable request of
Purchaser, will provide Purchaser with the names of those Persons employed
by the Equityholders or the Companies who were previously involved in the
preparation of the Companies financial statements and federal, state or local
regulatory reporting requirements and will use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such Persons to cooperate fully with and assist Purchaser in the
preparation of the Companies financial statements and federal, state or local
regulatory reporting requirements to the extent such reports relate to periods
prior to the Closing Date, at Purchasers sole expense.

9.8 _Insurance_. Purchaser and/or IBP shall maintain the Companies insurance
policies that are in place as of the Closing Date through the remainder of
the then-existing terms of such policies. Thereafter, and continuing for at
least as long as the statute of limitations may apply to claims for which the
Equityholders have any obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under _Section 11_, Purchaser and/or IBP shall maintain for the
Companies insurance in scope and amount consistent with IBPs past practices
and with deductible limits for the Companies as mutually agreed upon by
Equityholders Representative and Purchaser.

9.9 _Collection of Uncollected Accounts Receivable (including Retainage
Amounts)_. Subject to the "bad debt" reserves shown on the Closing Balance
Sheet, if Purchaser is not able to collect any Accounts Receivable set forth
on _Schedule 5.10_ within 365 days after the Closing Date (as to any Account
Receivable other than a Retainage Amount) and 545 days after the Closing Date
(as to any Retainage Amount) (each, an " _Uncollected Account_ "), then
Purchaser, as its sole remedy, shall require the Equityholders to purchase
each Uncollected Account from the applicable Company at a purchase price equal
to its then current balance. Thereafter, Equityholders Representative may use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect the Uncollected
Accounts. Purchasers exercise of its rights under this _Section 9.9_ will
be in lieu of any other remedy that Purchaser may have under this Agreement as
a result of not being able to collect any of the Uncollected Accounts.

 

SECTION 10

_TAX MATTERS _

10.1 _Apportionment of Taxes_. All Taxes and Tax liabilities with respect to a
Company (or the Equityholders by virtue of the tax status of a Company) that
relate to a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period as follows: (a) in the case of Taxes
that are either: (i) based upon or measured by reference to income, receipts,
profits, capital or net worth (including sales and use Taxes); (ii) imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible) other than Transfer Taxes as defined below;
or (iii) required to be withheld, the amount of such Taxes allocated to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if a Companys Tax year ended at the end of the day on the
Closing Date; and (b) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with
respect to a

 



38  Company other than those described in clause (a), the amount of such Taxes
allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on
an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. The Equityholders
will be solely liable for, and will timely pay, all Taxes and Tax liabilities
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of each Company, including,
without limitation, any portion of a Straddle Period allocable or apportioned
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser will be solely liable for, and will
timely pay, all Taxes and Tax liabilities allocable to the Post-Closing Tax
Period of each Company, including, without limitation, any portion of a
Straddle Period allocable or apportioned to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

sharing Contracts binding upon any Company shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date. After the Closing Date, no Company will have any further rights
or liabilities thereunder.

10.3 _Payment of Taxes Arising from Transaction_. Any transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees
and recording charges, incurred in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
") shall be paid by the Equityholders. Purchaser shall prepare and file any
Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes, and the Equityholders shall
cooperate with Purchaser in the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns,
including promptly supplying any information in their possession that is
reasonably necessary to complete such Tax Returns.

10.4 _Tax Returns_. Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax
Returns required to be filed by any Company after the Closing Date with
respect to a Straddle Period or a Post-Closing Tax Period; __provided__ ,
__however__ , that any Tax Returns relating to Taxes for which the
Equityholders are liable for under _Section 10.1_, or for which the
Equityholders would be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party, may be
reviewed and commented on by Equityholders Representative (to the extent it
affects any Equityholder), as applicable, prior to filing. Equityholders
Representative shall advise Purchaser of any dispute(s) with respect to any
such Tax Return following his review. The parties agree to attempt in good
faith to resolve any such dispute(s). If the parties cannot resolve such
dispute(s) after such good faith efforts, the parties shall submit such
dispute(s) to the Independent Accountants for resolution pursuant to the terms
of _Section 1.3(b)_. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
Independent Accountants shall select the position put forth by either
Purchaser or the Equityholders Representative. The Equityholders shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns required to be filed by any
Company solely with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser shall be
permitted to review and comment on such Tax Return prior to filing. Purchaser

dispute(s) to the Independent Accountants for resolution pursuant to the
terms of _Section 1.3(b)_. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
Independent Accountants shall select the position put forth by either
Purchaser or the Equityholders Representative.

 



39 10.5 _Tax Treatment of Transaction_ ; _Purchase Price Allocation._ The parties
agree that the purchase of the Trilok Shares and the Alpha Company Shares
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement will be treated, for federal income
Tax purposes, as a purchase by Purchaser of the assets of Trilok and Alpha
Company. The parties agree that the consideration described in _Section 1_
of this Agreement and other items properly includible in the deemed sales
price of the assets of Trilok and Alpha Company shall be allocated, for Tax
purposes, among the assets of Trilok and Alpha Company in a manner consistent
with the provisions of Code §1060 and all regulations promulgated thereunder.
_Schedule 10.5_ will be attached to this Agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable and will set forth the fair market value of assets of Trilok and
Alpha Company that the parties agree will be used to allocate such
consideration (the _"Allocation Schedule")_. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare and deliver to Equityholders
Representative IRS Form 8594 reflecting the allocation of the Purchase Price
and other items includible in the deemed sales price among the assets of
Trilok and Alpha Company in accordance with the Allocation Schedule,
for inclusion with the federal income Tax Return of each Seller. Purchaser
shall permit Equityholders Representative to review and comment on the IRS
Form 8594. Equityholders Representative shall advise Purchaser of any
dispute(s) with respect to the IRS Form 8594 following his review. The
parties agree to attempt in good faith to resolve any such dispute(s). If the
parties cannot resolve such dispute(s) after such good faith efforts, the
parties shall submit such dispute(s) to the Independent Accountants for
resolution pursuant to the terms of _Section 1.3(b)_. To the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, the Independent Accountants shall select the position put
forth by either Purchaser or the Equityholders Representative. Trilok, Alpha
Company, Purchaser and the Equityholders agree to report this transaction for
federal income Tax purposes in accordance with the Tax treatment described
above in this _Section 10.5_ and the IRS Form 8594, and shall not take any
position or action inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax Return,
in any refund claim, in any litigation, investigation or otherwise;
__provided__ , __however__ , that if, in any audit of any Tax Return of any
of the Equityholders, Purchaser, Trilok or Alpha Company by a Taxing
Authority, the fair market values are finally determined to be different from
the IRS Form 8594, as adjusted, Purchaser, the applicable Company, and the
Equityholders may (but shall not be obligated to) take any position or action
consistent with the fair market values as finally determined in such audit.

 

10.6 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Following the Closing, the Equityholders,
on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall, and Purchaser shall
cause the Companies to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other party, in connection with any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Companies or the preparation of
any Tax Return of the Companies. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon any other partys request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax matter or required by the Code
or other Applicable Law and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Equityholders and Purchaser agree (a) to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Companies relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Purchaser or the Equityholders, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (b) to give the other party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding
any such books and records and allow such other party to

 



40  take possession of such books and records. Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Equityholders, on the other hand, agree, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). The Equityholders,
on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, further agree, upon
request, to provide the other party with all information that any party may be
required to report pursuant to the Code and all regulations
promulgated thereunder.

10.7 _Controversies_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall notify Equityholders Representative in writing within ten
(10) days of the receipt by Purchaser or any of the Companies of written
notice of any inquiries, audits, examinations, assessments, or proceedings
from any Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes of the Companies for which the
Equityholders would be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant
to this Agreement (any such inquiry, assessment, proceeding or similar event,
a " _Tax Matter_ "). Equityholders Representative may, at his own expense,
participate in and, upon notice to Purchaser and his: (i) irrevocable
acknowledgement in writing of the Equityholders responsibility for and
agreement to indemnify the Indemnified Parties for Indemnified Losses related
to or resulting from any Tax Matters; and (ii) furnishing of satisfactory
evidence of the Equityholders financial ability to indemnify the Indemnified
Parties, assume the defense of any such Tax Matter relating solely to a Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date (but not a Straddle Period,
which is governed by _Section 10.7(b)_). If Equityholders Representative
assumes such defense, Equityholders Representative shall have the authority,
with respect to such Tax Matter, to represent the interests of the relevant
Company before the relevant Taxing Authority and shall have the right to
control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Tax Matter
subject to the limitations contained herein, including responding to
inquiries, and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for
additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of,
or relating to, such Tax Matter. Purchaser has the right (but not the duty) to
participate in the defense of such Tax Matter and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by Equityholders
Representative. Equityholders Representative shall not enter into any
settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax Matter to the extent
that it adversely affects or may adversely affect the Tax liability of
Purchaser, any of the Companies or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing for
any Post-Closing Tax Period, including any Straddle Period, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Equityholders Representative shall keep
Purchaser fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status
and nature of any such Tax Matter, and will, in good faith, allow Purchaser
or Purchasers counsel to consult with him regarding the conduct of or
positions taken in any such proceeding and to be present at any meetings or
proceedings with the relevant Taxing Authority.

 

(b) Purchaser has the right to represent the interests of the Companies before
the relevant Taxing Authority with respect to any inquiry, audit,
examination, assessment, proceeding or other similar event relating to a
Straddle Period (a " _Straddle Period Tax Matter_ ") and has the right to
control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Straddle
Period Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and
contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for additional
Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency

 



41  or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Straddle Period Tax
Matter. If the Equityholders would be required to indemnify any Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such Straddle Period Tax
Matter then: (A) Equityholders Representative shall have the right (but not
the duty) to participate in the defense of such Straddle Period Tax Matter and
to employ counsel, at his own expense, separate from counsel employed by
Purchaser, (B) Purchaser shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise
compromise any such Straddle Period Tax Matter to the extent that it adversely
affects the Tax liability of the Equityholders without the prior written
consent of Equityholders Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (C) Purchaser shall keep
Equityholders Representative informed with respect to the commencement,
status, and nature of any such Straddle Period Tax Matter, and will, in good
faith, allow Equityholders Representative or his counsel to consult with it
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding and to be
present at any meetings or proceedings with the relevant Taxing Authority.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 10.7_, to the extent they conflict with
any provision in _Section 11_, supersede the provisions of _Section 11_. To
the extent the provisions of this _Section 10.7_ do not conflict with the
provisions of _Section 11_, the provisions of this _Section 10.7_ shall be
read in concert with, and shall supplement, the provisions of _Section 11_.

continue until it shall have been finally settled, decided or adjudicated as

affect such partys reliance on the representations and warranties made by

right or remedy set forth in any Transaction Document). In furtherance of the
foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under

claim is asserted by any third party in respect of which one of
the Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnity hereunder, one or more
of the Indemnified Parties will give the party or parties from which such
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ "), written notice

option and expense, to participate in the defense of such a proceeding or
claim

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if: (i) the Indemnifying Parties fail to
fulfill the Defense Conditions; or (ii) the Indemnified Parties shall in good
faith determine that: (x) the conduct of the defense of any claim subject to

rights or obligations of a Equityholder without a similar proportionate
effect upon the substantive rights or obligations of the other Equityholders,

thereto.

shall be entitled to rely on any action taken or omission to act by
Equityholders Representative, on behalf of such Equityholder, pursuant to

any Company for any Authorized Action, except to the extent that such
Authorized Action is found by a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have constituted fraud or willful misconduct. Each
Equityholder hereby severally, for itself only and

 



48  not jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
Equityholders Representative against all expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
