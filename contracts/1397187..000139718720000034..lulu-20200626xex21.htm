solely in its capacity as the Holder Representative. Capitalized terms used
but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in Annex A.

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has unanimously (a) determined
that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, are fair to,
and in the best interests of, the Company and the Stockholders, (b) approved
and declared advisable the execution, delivery, and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger, and
(c) resolved to recommend that the Stockholders adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger and the other Transactions;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has approved and declared
advisable the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than eight (8)
hours after execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a stockholder written consent evidencing the Stockholder
Approval and joinders to this Agreement substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (each, a "Joinder Agreement"), in each case executed by
each Stockholder listed in the attached Exhibit B (each, a "Consenting
Stockholder");

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, the Person set forth on Schedule A to the Disclosure Letter (the
"Founder") has executed a Holdback Agreement (the "Holdback Agreement"), which
shall become effective upon the Closing; and

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, each of the individuals listed in the attached Exhibit C-1 (each, a
"Key Employee" and together, the "Key Employees") is executing and delivering
to Parent (a) an offer letter that describes, among other matters, the terms
of his or her employment with a Parent Entity after the Closing (each, a "Key
Employee Offer Letter"), (b) a confidentiality and invention assignment
agreement (each, a "CIAA"), (c) a noncompetition and nonsolicitation
agreement, (d) an Option Consent (if such Key Employee holds a Company Option)
and (e) a Promised Option Waiver (if such Key Employee has Promised Options),
the effectiveness of all of such agreements being conditioned upon the Closing
(such documents, collectively and together with the Holdback Agreement (as
applicable in the case of the Founder), the "Key Employee Documents").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties,
and the mutual agreements and covenants set forth herein, and intending to be
legally bound, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Holder Representative
hereby agree as follows:



ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, (a) at the Effective Time, the separate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the
"Merger"), with the Company as the surviving corporation after the Effective
Time (the "Surviving Corporation"), and (b) from and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have all the effects of a merger under the DGCL and other
Applicable Law.

1.2 The Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place by
exchange of electronic deliveries and signatures, unless another method or
place is mutually agreed upon in writing by Parent and the Company, upon the
later of (a) July 7, 2020 and (b) two (2) Business Days after the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article V and Article VI (other than
such conditions that, by their terms, are intended to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). The
date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

1.3 Effective Date and Time. On the Closing Date, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause
appropriate certificates (together, the "Certificate of Merger") complying
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL to be properly executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary
of State"). The Merger shall become effective on the date and at the time of
the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such other date and time as may
be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
Unless otherwise specified by Parent prior to the Effective Time, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated to read in their
entireties as the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and restated
shall be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"Curiouser Products Inc." Thereafter, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation may be amended in accordance with their
respective terms and as provided by Applicable Law.

1.5 Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, the directors and officers
of the Company shall resign and the directors and officers of Merger Sub shall
continue in office as the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation,
and such directors and officers shall hold office until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation, or removal in accordance with, and subject to, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

1.6 Effect of the Merger.

1.6.1 Treatment of Equity. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement (including, as and to the extent
applicable, each of the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 1.6 and
the conditions set forth in the Holdback Agreement), by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any party hereto or the holders thereof:

(a) All shares of any class of Capital Stock held by the Company as treasury
shares shall be canceled. 

(b) Each issued and outstanding share of Preferred Stock (including each share
of Preferred Stock held by Parent) and each issued and outstanding share of
Common Stock, in each case other than Dissenting Shares, shall, subject to the
other terms and conditions contained herein, be converted into the right to
receive from Parent the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(c) Each Company Option shall be canceled and terminated at the Closing, and
subject to the other terms and conditions contained herein:

(i) each holder of a Company Option that is not a Substitution Option shall be
entitled to receive from Parent a portion of the Merger Consideration, equal
to (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration that would have been payable
pursuant hereto in respect of each share issuable in respect of such Company
Option had such Company Option been exercised immediately prior to the Closing
less (B) the exercise price with respect to such Company Option; provided that
each Company Option issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Closing with an exercise price that is greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be canceled and terminated without any cash payment or any
other consideration being made in respect thereof; and

(ii) each holder of a Company Option that is a Substitution Option will be
entitled to receive from Parent a nonstatutory stock option to purchase shares
of Parent Common Stock (each, a "Parent Option"), which will (A) be subject to
a two-year vesting schedule, pursuant to which fifty percent (50%) of the
Parent Option will vest and become exercisable on each of the two consecutive
anniversaries following the Closing Date, provided that the holder continues
in service with a Parent Entity through each of the two vesting dates, (B) be
exercisable for a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (1) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Substitution Option
immediately prior to the Closing multiplied by (2) the Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest whole share, (C) will have a per share exercise price
equal to (x) the per share exercise price of the Substitution Option
immediately prior to the Closing divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest cent and (D) otherwise be issued in accordance with the Parent
Option Plan.

(d) Subject to Section 4.9, each Promised Option shall be canceled and
terminated at the Closing, and subject to the other terms and conditions
contained herein:

(i) each holder of a Promised Option that is not a Substitution Promised
Option shall be entitled to receive from Parent a portion of the Merger
Consideration, equal to (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration that would have
been payable pursuant hereto in respect of each share in respect of such
Promised Option had such Promised Option been issued as promised and exercised
immediately prior to the Closing, less (B) the Deemed Exercise Price with
respect to such Promised Option (the "Spread Value");

(ii) each holder of a Substitution Promised Option will be entitled to receive
restricted stock units ("Parent RSUs") that will settle into the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (A) the Spread Value of the
Substitution Promised Option divided by (B) the Parent Stock Price, rounded
down to the nearest whole share, and be subject to a three-year vesting
schedule, pursuant to which 33% of the Parent RSUs will vest on each of the
first and second anniversaries of the Closing Date, and 34% of the Parent RSUs
will vest on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, provided that the
holder continues in service 

with a Parent Entity through each of the three vesting dates, and be issued in
accordance with the Parent Option Plan.

(e) Each Company Warrant shall be canceled and terminated at the Closing. Each
holder of a Company Warrant shall be entitled to receive from Parent for each
share of Preferred Stock or Common Stock subject to each Company Warrant a
portion of the Merger Consideration, equal to (i) the Per Share Merger
Consideration that would have been payable pursuant hereto in respect of such
share had such Company Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time, less (ii) the exercise price with respect to such Company
Warrant; provided that each Company Warrant issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Closing with an exercise price that is greater than
the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be canceled and terminated without
any cash payment or any other consideration being made in respect thereof.

(f) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be
converted into one (1) share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

1.6.2 Indemnification Escrow; Expense Fund.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, as a partial mechanism to
satisfy the indemnification obligations of the Vested Equityholders set forth
in Article VII, an aggregate of $10,000,000 (the "Escrow Amount") and the
aggregate amount of cash (including any interest or other amounts earned
thereon) so held by the Escrow Agent from time to time, the "Escrow Fund")
shall not be paid to the Vested Equityholders at the Effective Time, but shall
instead be withheld in accordance with each Vested Equityholder's Pro Rata
Share of such amount and deposited with PNC Bank, National Association ("PNC")
, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), which Escrow Fund shall be governed by
this Agreement and the escrow agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit I (with such changes as Parent and the Holder Representative
may agree in writing, the "Escrow Agreement"). Within ten (10) Business Days
following the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date, Parent and the
Holder Representative will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to the
Payment Agent, the Surviving Corporation or other applicable Parent Entity, as
applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with
wire transfer instructions provided by the Payment Agent or the applicable
Parent Entity, an amount equal to the (i) the Escrow Fund less (ii) an amount
sufficient to satisfy any pending Indemnification Claims made by any
Indemnified Party that were made in accordance with Section 4.6, 7.4 or 7.5,
as applicable, in each case prior to the expiration of the Survival Period,
for further distribution (and if by the Payment Agent, Parent shall cause the
Payment Agent to distribute) to each Vested Equityholder in accordance with
such Vested Equityholder's Pro Rata Share, subject to Parent's right to seek
satisfaction for any indemnification obligations of Vested Equityholders
pursuant to Section 7.2(b) directly against such Vested Equityholder. Promptly
following the final resolution of, and full payment or credit in connection
with, any such pending Indemnification Claims, Parent and the Holder
Representative will jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to the Payment
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or other applicable Parent Entity, as
applicable, for further distribution (and if by the Payment Agent, Parent
shall cause the Payment Agent to distribute) to each Vested Equityholder, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with wire transfer
instructions provided by the Payment Agent or the applicable Parent Entity (or
in the case of payment attributed to Vested Company Options that were Employee
Company Options, through Parent or Surviving Corporation's standard payroll
procedures, at the discretion of Parent), each such Vested Equityholder's Pro
Rata Share of any remaining portion of the Escrow Fund, subject to Parent's
right to seek satisfaction for any indemnification obligations of Vested
Equityholders pursuant to Section 7.2(b) directly against such Vested
Equityholder. To the extent required by Applicable Law, a portion of any
amounts released from the Escrow Fund shall be treated for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes as imputed interest and shall be reported as such. 

(b) The rights of the Vested Equityholders to receive payment from the Escrow
Fund is personal to such Vested Equityholder, and is not transferable or
assignable, and any purported transfer or assignment shall be void.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for the purposes of
paying directly, or reimbursing the Holder Representative for, any third party
expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, an
aggregate of $250,000 (the "Expense Fund") shall not be paid to the Vested
Equityholders at the Effective Time, but shall instead shall be withheld in
accordance with each Vested Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of such amount and
be deposited by Parent at the Effective Time with the Holder Representative;
provided further, in the case of Vested Company Options that were Employee
Company Options, such contribution to the Expense Fund shall be calculated
based on the Vested Equityholder's Pro Rata Share but shall be contributed to
the Expense Fund after being subject to applicable payroll Tax withholding.
The Vested Equityholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Holder Representative
any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or
earnings. The Holder Representative will not be liable for any loss of
principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Holder Representative will hold these funds
separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating
expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these
funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as
practicable following the completion of the Holder Representative's
responsibilities, or earlier as directed by the advisory committee to the
Holder Representative named in the engagement letter between the Holder
Representative and the Company, the Holder Representative will deliver any
remaining balance of the Expense Fund to the Payment Agent or the applicable
Parent Entity for further distribution (and if by the Payment Agent, Parent
shall cause the Payment Agent to distribute) to the Vested Equityholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

1.6.3 Dissenting Shares. Stockholders who have complied with all the
requirements for perfecting appraisal rights, as required under the DGCL,
shall be entitled to their appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to
such shares ("Dissenting Shares"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, (a) if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such holder's appraisal rights,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such holder's shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder is then
entitled under this Agreement, without interest thereon and upon surrender of
the certificate representing such shares in accordance with this Agreement
together with any other documents required under Section 1.6.4 and (b) any
Dissenting Shares held by a Stockholder who has perfected such Stockholder's
appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL shall not be
converted into the right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.6.1 (including any portion of the Escrow Amount). In
determining the value of Dissenting Shares, appropriate reductions and
deferrals shall be applied to reflect the withholding by Parent of the Escrow
Amount. The Company shall provide to Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
for appraisal or purchase received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments related to such demands served in
accordance with the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands
under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, or as otherwise required under the DGCL, voluntarily make any
payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any Claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares. Subject to
Section 7.2, the payment of consideration under this Agreement to the
Stockholders (other than in respect of Dissenting Shares, which shall be
treated as provided in this Section 1.6.3 and under the DGCL) shall not be
affected by the exercise or potential exercise of appraisal rights under the
DGCL by any Stockholder. 

1.6.4 Exchange of Certificates and Payment. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall (i) designate PNC to act as payment agent in the Merger (the
"Payment Agent") and (ii) appoint the Escrow Agent as escrow agent to hold the
Escrow Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than the next Business
Day) following the Closing, Parent shall cause (i) an amount equal to the
portion of the Merger Consideration payable at the Effective Time to the
Vested Equityholders in respect of their shares of Capital Stock, Company
Warrants and Non-Employee Company Options (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding the portion of the Merger Consideration that constitutes the Escrow
Amount and the Expense Fund) to be deposited with the Payment Agent for
payment to the Vested Equityholders in respect of their shares of Capital
Stock, Company Warrants and Non-Employee Company Options as set forth in the
Spreadsheet, (ii) an amount equal to the portion of the Merger Consideration
payable at the Effective Time to the Vested Equityholders in respect of their
Employee Company Options and Promised Options (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, excluding the portion of the Merger Consideration that constitutes the
Escrow Amount and the Expense Fund) to be deposited with the Surviving
Corporation or other applicable Parent Entity for payment to the Vested
Equityholders in respect of their Employee Company Options and Promised
Options as set forth in the Spreadsheet, (iii) the Escrow Amount to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, which amount shall be held and disbursed by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
and (iv) the Expense Fund to be deposited with the Holder Representative,
which amount shall be held and disbursed by the Holder Representative in
accordance with this Agreement and the engagement letter between the Holder
Representative and the Company.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than the second Business
Day) following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to provide to
each Stockholder a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit D (the "Letter of Transmittal"). Subject to Section 1.6.2, upon
delivery of a duly executed Joinder Agreement or Letter of Transmittal (and
any other documents reasonably required thereby, including applicable Tax
forms), each Stockholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.6.1 and all book-entry shares in respect of such
Preferred Stock or Common Stock shall be canceled. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the portion of the Merger Consideration payable to the
Founder in respect of the Founder's Capital Stock that is held back pursuant
to the Holdback Agreement (the "Holdback Consideration") shall not be payable
by Parent or the Payment Agent at the Effective Time and shall instead be
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Holdback Agreement as are
in effect as of the Effective Time. If the Merger Consideration (or any
portion thereof) is to be delivered to any Person other than the Person in
whose name the shares of Capital Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition to such delivery that the Person
requesting such delivery shall pay to Parent any transfer or other Taxes
required solely by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration (or any
portion thereof) to a Person other than the registered holder of the shares of
Capital Stock so surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(c) Subject to Section 1.6.2, upon the delivery of a duly executed Warrant
Termination Agreement to the Payment Agent (and any other documents required
thereby, including applicable Tax forms), each holder of a Company Warrant
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion of the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive at that time pursuant
to Section 1.6.1(e).

(d) Subject to Section 1.6.2, upon the delivery of a duly executed Option
Consent to the Payment Agent (and any other documents required thereby,
including applicable Tax forms), each holder of a Non-Employee Company Option
that are Vested Company Options shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive at that time pursuant to 

Section 1.6.1(c). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the portion
of the Merger Consideration payable to any holder who continues in service
with a Parent Entity immediately following the Effective Time and holds a Non-
Employee Company Option that is an Unvested Company Option (the "Unvested Non-
Employee Option Consideration") shall not be payable at the Effective Time and
shall instead be subject to the same terms and conditions (including, if
applicable, the vesting and vesting acceleration arrangements and other terms
and conditions set forth in the Option Plan and the applicable stock option
agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject
to Payment Agent's receipt of an executed Option Consent with respect to such
Non-Employee Company Options that are Unvested Company Options (together with
any other documents reasonably required by Payment Agent), such Unvested Non-
Employee Option Consideration shall be paid quarterly by Parent to the Payment
Agent following the vesting dates applicable to such Unvested Non-Employee
Option Consideration and Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to promptly pay
such amounts to the applicable holder of such Non-Employee Company Options. No
Unvested Non-Employee Option Consideration, or right thereto, may be pledged,
encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation
of law), by any Person, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable
process in satisfaction of any liability of such Person, prior to the
distribution to such Person of such Unvested Non-Employee Option Consideration
in accordance with this Agreement. A holder of a Non-Employee Company Option
that is an Unvested Company Option who does not continue in service with a
Parent Entity immediately following the Effective Time will not receive any
Unvested Non-Employee Option Consideration and such Unvested Company Option
shall be cancelled and terminated for no consideration as of the Effective
Time.

(e) Subject to Section 1.6.2, as soon as practicable after the Closing (but no
later than the next regular payroll cycle of the Surviving Corporation or the
applicable Parent Entity), and after the receipt by Parent of such holder's
executed Option Consent, the applicable Parent Entity shall pay to such holder
of Employee Company Options that are Vested Company Options or vested Promised
Options the portion of the Merger Consideration payable to such holder in
accordance with Section 1.6.1(c). Such amounts payable in respect of Vested
Company Options or vested Promised Options shall be paid in accordance with
the applicable Parent Entity's normal or special payroll practices. The
applicable Parent Entity shall, in accordance with Section 1.8, deduct and
withhold any amounts that are required to be deducted and withheld under
Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the portion
of the Merger Consideration (i) payable in respect of Employee Company Options
that are Unvested Company Options pursuant to Section 1.6.1(c) (the "Unvested
Employee Option Cash Consideration") and (ii) payable in respect of any
unvested Promised Options pursuant to Section 1.6.1(d)(i) (the "Promised
Option Cash Consideration" and together with the Holdback Consideration,
Unvested Non-Employee Option Consideration and Unvested Employee Option Cash
Consideration, the "Unvested Cash") shall not be payable by Parent or an
applicable Parent Entity at the Effective Time and shall instead be subject to
the same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the vesting and
vesting acceleration arrangements and other terms and conditions set forth in
the Option Plan and the applicable stock option agreement or, in the case of
Promised Options, as set forth on Schedule 2.3(e) of the Disclosure Letter) as
are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the case of Unvested
Employee Option Cash Consideration and Promised Option Cash Consideration,
subject to Parent's receipt of an executed Option Consent and/or Promised
Option Waiver, as applicable, together with any other documents reasonably
required by Parent, such consideration shall be paid quarterly following the
vesting date applicable to such consideration in accordance with the
applicable Parent Entity's normal or special payroll practices and subject to
any amounts that are required to be deducted and withheld under Applicable
Law. No Unvested Employee Option Cash Consideration and Promised Option Cash
Consideration, or right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or
transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person, other
than Parent, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any liability of such Person, prior to the distribution to
such Person of such Unvested Employee Option Cash Consideration and Promised
Option 

Cash Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. A holder of an Employee
Company Option that is an Unvested Company Option or an unvested Promised
Option who does not continue in service with a Parent Entity immediately
following the Effective Time will not receive any Unvested Employee Option
Cash Consideration or Promised Option Cash Consideration and such Unvested
Company Option and unvested Promised Option shall be cancelled and terminated
for no consideration as of the Effective Time.

(f) Any cash deposited with the Payment Agent and not exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Capital Stock, Company Warrants, or Non-
Employee Company Options in accordance with this Section 1.6.4 within 12
months after such cash is deposited with the Payment Agent shall be
redelivered or repaid by the Payment Agent to Parent. After such time, any
Equityholder who has not theretofore surrendered shares of Capital Stock or
delivered a Warrant Termination Agreement or an Option Consent, as applicable,
and/or the other documents required to be executed and delivered by such
Equityholder pursuant to this Section 1.6.4 to the Payment Agent, subject to
Applicable Law, shall look as a general creditor only to Parent for payment of
such holder's portion of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, neither Parent nor any other party hereto shall be liable
to a holder of shares of Capital Stock, Company Warrants or Non-Employee
Company Options for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to Applicable Law, including abandoned property, escheat, and similar
Applicable Law.

1.6.5 No Further Transfers. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers of any shares of Capital Stock on the stock transfer books of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, book-entry
shares formerly representing shares of Capital Stock are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, such shares shall be forwarded to the Payment Agent and
shall be canceled and exchanged in accordance with Section 1.6.4, subject, in
the case of Dissenting Shares, to Section 1.6.3.

1.7 Company Options. Each Company Option shall be treated as set forth in
Section 1.6.1(c), Section 1.6.4(d) and Section 1.6.4(e). The Company agrees
that the board of directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the Company's 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Option Plan")
and/or the Company Options) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be reasonably required to (a) effect the treatment of the
Company Options as set forth in Section 1.6.1(c) as of the Closing and (b)
terminate the Option Plan and each Company Option and Promised Option as of
the Closing.

1.8 Tax Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each
applicable Parent Entity and the Payment Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other payments contemplated by
this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or other Applicable Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld in accordance with
Section 1.8 and remitted to or credited by the appropriate Tax Authority in
accordance with Applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding were made. At or prior to the Closing, and at such
time thereafter as reasonably requested by a Parent Entity or the Payment
Agent, the Payment Agent or the applicable Parent Entity shall provide written
notice to the Equityholders requesting that the Equityholders provide such
Parent Entity or the Payment Agent, as applicable, any IRS Forms W-4, W-8, or
W-9 and any other certificates or forms, as applicable, in order to allow each
applicable Parent Entity or the Payment Agent to meet their respective
withholding and information reporting obligations under Applicable Law. The
parties shall cooperate to allow each Parent Entity or the Payment Agent, as
applicable, to effectuate such withholding by means reasonably acceptable to
Parent, including by paying the applicable portion of any consideration for
which such withholding is required to the applicable Parent Entity or any of
its Affiliates and causing such Person to withhold the applicable amounts
through their respective payroll systems on or before the applicable Parent
Entity's second regularly scheduled payroll occurring after such consideration
becomes due and payable. 

1.9 Tax Consequences. The parties hereto intend the Merger to be a taxable
sale of shares of Capital Stock by the Equityholders. Except as provided in
Section 4.6(f), Parent makes no representations or warranties to any of the
Company or Equityholders regarding the Tax treatment of the Merger, or any of
the Tax consequences to any of the Company or the Equityholders of this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions. The Company
acknowledges that the Company and the Equityholders are relying solely on
their own Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the
other Transactions. The Company understands that, except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, the Company (and not Parent) shall be responsible for the
Company's Tax Liabilities that may arise from the Transactions.

occupational safety and health. Since the inception of the Company, the
Company has withheld all amounts required by Applicable Law or by Contract to
be withheld from the salaries, wages, and other payments to its employees,
including common law employees, and is not liable for any arrears of wages

or could reasonably be expected to result, in a Claim before any Governmental
Body, including (without limitation) Claims for wage and hour violations,
compensation, severance benefits, vacation time or vacation pay or pension
benefits, harassment, discrimination, retaliation, failure to accommodate,
wrongful discharge, child labor or otherwise. Since the inception of the

employment was involuntarily terminated general releases of all Claims
(whether actual or potential, known or unknown) against the Company, and all
such releases of employment Claims in favor of the Company obtained from
former employees comply in all respects with Applicable Law and are effective

Service Provider who, directly or indirectly, supervises any other Company
Service Provider and (ii) the Company has not made any payment arising out of,
or entered into any settlement agreement or conducted any investigation
related to, allegations of sexual harassment, sexual discrimination, sexual
assault or misconduct by or regarding any Company Service Provider or other

sexual discrimination, sexual assault, or misconduct have been made, the
Company has promptly, thoroughly and impartially investigated all such
allegations and, where it was determined that such allegation had potential
merit, the Company has taken prompt and appropriate action.

which the Company may have rights or Liability under which any current or
former Company Service Provider is subject comply in all respects with
Applicable Law.

(f) The Company is not party to any labor, collective bargaining, or similar
agreement, and there are currently no organizational campaigns, petitions, or
other unionization activities seeking recognition of a collective bargaining
unit that could affect the Company. None of the Transactions would reasonably 

be expected to require approval or consent by any works council, labor
collective group, or other similar third-party entity. No employees of the
Company are, or in the past three (3) years have been, represented by any
labor organization, or other collective representative entity, union, or
organization. There is no labor dispute pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or affecting the Company, and the Company has not
experienced any work stoppage since its inception. To the Knowledge of the

2.9 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Schedule 2.9(a) to the Disclosure Letter contains an accurate and complete
list of all Employee Benefit Plans, provided that with respect to any
employment agreements, offer letters or consulting agreements with any Company
Service Providers that are on forms of agreements made available to Parent and
that are terminable "at-will" without a notice period, severance, termination
or change of control or similar types of payments or benefits, only the forms
of such employment agreements, offer letters or consulting agreements shall be
set forth on Schedule 2.9(a) to the Disclosure Letter. Subject to the
Company's statutory and contractual obligations to pay earned and vested
benefits or provide notice the, terms of each Employee Benefit Plan permit the
Company to amend and terminate such Employee Benefit Plan at any time and for
any reason without Liability (other than routine administrative costs in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice). The Company
has no agreement, commitment, or other obligation to adopt, enter into or
contribute to any other Employee Benefit Plan, or to modify or amend any
existing Employee Benefit Plan (other than as contemplated under this
Agreement or as required by Applicable Law).

(b) The Company has made available to Parent a current, accurate, and complete
copy of each Employee Benefit Plan (or, to the extent such plan is unwritten,

applicable: (i) any contractual obligations relating to any Employee Benefit
Plan, including all trust agreements, insurance or annuity contracts,
investment management agreements, record keeping agreements, and other
documents or instruments related thereto, (ii) the most recent determination

with any Employee Benefit Plan. Any Employee Benefit Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been established under a
standardized prototype plan for which an IRS opinion letter has been obtained
by the plan sponsor and is valid as to the adopting employer or has either
obtained from the IRS a favorable determination letter as to its qualified
status under the Code, or has applied (or has time remaining in which to
apply) to the IRS for such a determination letter prior to the expiration of
the requisite period under applicable IRS regulations or pronouncements in
which to apply for such determination letter, and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination. Nothing has occurred since the
issuance of a determination letter or opinion letter that would reasonably be
expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified status of any Employee Benefit
Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code. 

(c) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan: (i) such Employee Benefit Plan
is, and has been, properly and legally established, and at all times has been,
maintained, operated, administered, and funded in all material respects in

returns, reports, notices, statements, summary plan descriptions, and other
disclosures with respect to such Employee Benefit Plan required to be filed
with any Governmental Body or distributed to any participant therein have been
properly and completely prepared and duly filed or distributed on or before
their applicable due dates; and (iii) the Company and each other Person
(including each fiduciary) have, at all times, properly performed all their
material duties and obligations (whether arising by operation of law, by
contract, or otherwise) under or with respect to such Employee Benefit Plan,
including (without limitation) all reporting, disclosure, and notification
obligations. The Company has not incurred, directly or indirectly, any
Liability (except for routine contributions and benefit payments) under ERISA,
the Code, or any other Applicable Law, or pursuant to any indemnification or
similar agreement with respect to such Employee Benefit Plan.

(d) Neither the Company nor any Employee Benefit Plan provides or has any
obligation to provide (or contribute toward the cost of) post-employment or
post-termination benefits of any kind with respect to any current or former
Company Service Provider, including (without limitation) death and medical
benefits, except for continuation coverage mandated by Sections 601 through
608 of ERISA and Section 4980B(f) of the Code or other Applicable Law.

(e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other Operative
Documents or the consummation of the Transactions (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent event(s), including (without
limitation) a termination of service) will not (i) entitle any individual to
severance pay, unemployment compensation, change in control payment or benefit
or any other compensation or benefit, (ii) result in any benefit or right
becoming established or increased, or accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of any benefit, under any Employee Benefit Plan, (iii) require the
Company, Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates to transfer or set
aside any assets to fund or otherwise provide for any benefits for any
individual, (iv) impair or decrease any of the rights of the Company or any of
its Affiliates with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, (v) result in any
loss of deduction for any reason, including pursuant to Section 280G or 162(m)
of the Code, or (vi) result in the forgiveness in whole or in part of any
outstanding loans made by the Company to any Person.

(f) The Company has not received services from any individual (i) whom the
Company treated as an independent contractor, but who should have been treated
as a common law employee of the Company or (ii) who constituted a leased
employee of the Company under Section 414(n) of the Code.

(g) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains, or
contributes to, or has ever sponsored, maintained, or contributed to (or been
obligated to sponsor, maintain, or contribute to), (i) a "multiemployer plan,"
as defined in Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (ii) a multiple
employer plan within the meaning of Section 4063 or Section 4064 of ERISA or
Section 413 of the Code, (iii) an employee benefit plan that is subject to
Section 302 of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA, or Section 412 of the Code, or (iv) a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement," as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA.
No Employee Benefit Plan is a defined benefit pension plan.

(h) The Company does not sponsor, maintain, or contribute to, and has never
sponsored, maintained, or contributed to (or been obligated to sponsor,
maintain, or contribute to), any Employee Benefit Plan subject to the laws of
any jurisdiction outside of the United States.

(i) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a medical plan is in compliance in all
material respects with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the
Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act 

of 2010 (collectively, the "2010 Health Care Law"). The operation of each
Employee Benefit Plan that is a medical plan has not resulted in the
incurrence of any penalty to the Company pursuant to the 2010 Health Care Law.
The Company has not reimbursed any employee in the United States for health
insurance premiums, other than for a group health plan sponsored by the
Company.

Schedule 2.10.2(a) to the Disclosure Letter. All of the Company Intellectual
Property Registrations are valid (or in the case of applications, validly
applied for), subsisting and, except for pending applications, enforceable.
There are 

no information, materials, facts, or circumstances, including any information

to any third party of any Source Code, other than Company Service Providers
subject to confidentiality obligations with respect thereto.

Code, (ii) the granting by Parent or any of its Affiliates to any third party
any Company Intellectual Property Right or any other proprietary right, (iii)

Agreement nor the taking over by Parent of all of the Company Databases,
Company Data and other information relating to the Company's end users,
employees, vendors or clients, or any other category of individuals, will
cause, constitute or result in a material breach or violation of any Privacy
Laws, or a material breach of any Company Privacy Commitments or Company Data

Schedule 2.4(b) of the Disclosure Letter if entered into prior to the
Agreement Date).

(b) The Company shall give all notices and other information required to be
given to the employees of the Company, any collective bargaining unit

(a) The Company, each of the Equityholders, and Parent shall take any actions
reasonably necessary or appropriate to consummate the Transactions and fulfill
the conditions to the Closing set forth herein as promptly as practicable
following the Agreement Date, including, with respect to the Company, (a)
taking such actions as to encourage the Additional Employees to accept
employment with Parent or its Affiliates and (b) delivering to Parent such
certificates and other documents as required to satisfy each of the conditions
set forth in Article V. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any
condition to the Closing is that a document be acceptable or to the
satisfaction of Parent, this Section 4.3 shall not require Parent to waive
such right or otherwise accept a document that is not acceptable or
satisfactory to Parent. The Company, each of the Equityholders, and Parent
shall take any further actions reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement or any other Operative Document as may be requested by the
other parties hereto.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of Section 4.3(a), each
of Parent and the Company shall, to the extent permitted under Applicable Law,
(i) cooperate and coordinate, subject to all applicable privileges (including

submissions that are required to be made under any applicable Antitrust Laws

information that may be required or requested by any Governmental Body in
connection with such filings or submissions, (iii) supply any additional
information that may be required or requested by the Federal Trade Commission,

filings or submissions are made under any applicable Antitrust Laws as
promptly as practicable, and (iv) use their respective reasonable best efforts
consistent with Applicable Law to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under any applicable Antitrust Laws as soon as
reasonably practicable. Without limiting the generality of anything contained
in this Section 4.3(b), Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of
any material oral or written communication it receives from any Governmental
Body relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, permit
each other to review in advance, and consider any reasonable comments to, any
communication proposed to be made by such party to any Governmental Body and
provide the other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or other 

communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Body or members of its staff, on the other hand (subject
to appropriate redactions to protect any privileged or commercially sensitive
information); provided that Parent shall have the right to direct all matters
with respect to thereof. No party to this Agreement shall agree to participate
in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Body in respect of any such
filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives the
other the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The Company
and Parent will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging
such information (subject to appropriate redactions to protect any privileged
or commercially sensitive information) and providing such assistance as the
other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

(c) In furtherance of this Section 4.3 and subject to the limitations set
forth in this Section 4.3(c), if any objections are asserted with respect to
the Transactions under the HSR Act, any other applicable Antitrust Law or if
any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the
Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Body challenging the Transactions as violative of Antitrust Law, or that would
otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
Transactions, the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to resolve any such objections or lawsuits or other proceedings
(or threatened Legal Proceedings) so as to permit consummation of the
Transactions prior to the Termination Date (as defined below). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
shall be required to (i) litigate or contest any Legal Proceeding challenging
any of the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law, or (ii) (A) sell,
lease, license, transfer, dispose of, divest or otherwise encumber, or hold
separate pending any such action, or (B) propose, negotiate or offer to
effect, or consent or commit to, any such sale, lease, license, transfer,
disposal, divestiture of, or other Encumbrance on, or holding separate of,
before or after the Effective Time, any assets, licenses, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses, or interest therein of Parent, the Company, or the
Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective subsidiaries or other
Affiliates), (iii) take or agree to take any other action or agree or consent
to any limitations or restrictions on freedom of actions with respect to, or
its ability to retain, or make changes in, any such assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses, or interest therein of Parent,
the Company, or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective
subsidiaries or other Affiliates), (iv) take or agree to take any other action
or agree or consent to the holding separate of the shares of Capital Stock or
any limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates
to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Capital Stock, or (v)
take or agree to take any other action that is not conditioned on the
consummation of the Transactions (any one (1) or more of the foregoing
actions, an "Antitrust Restraint"). Parent may compel the Company to take any
Antitrust Restraint (or agree to take such Antitrust Restraint) if such
Antitrust Restraint is effective only after the Effective Time, and the
Company may not take any Antitrust Restraint in connection with the matters
contemplated by this Section 4.3(c) without the prior written consent of
Parent.

4.4 Confidentiality.

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms. Each party hereto agrees that it and its
directors, officers, employees, equityholders (subject to exceptions included
in the Joinder Agreement), Affiliates, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants, subsidiaries or other representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") shall hold the terms of this Agreement, and the fact of
this Agreement's existence, in strict confidence. At no time shall any party
hereto disclose any non-public information about this Agreement or any party
hereto to any other Person without the prior written consent of the party
hereto about which such non-public information relates. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the Company and its Representatives
and the Holder Representative shall be permitted to disclose terms that have
already been publicly disclosed by Parent; this provision shall not prohibit
disclosure 

of any and all terms to a party's or its Representative's financial, tax,
accounting and legal advisors (each of whom is subject to a similar obligation
of confidentiality) or to any Governmental Body or administrative agency to
the extent necessary or advisable in compliance with Applicable Law and the
rules of Nasdaq, and following Closing, the Holder Representative shall be
permitted to disclose information (including relating to indemnification
claims and any other matters related to this Agreement that the Holder
Representative is handling on behalf of the Equityholders) on a need-to-know
basis to the Equityholders (each of whom is subject to a similar obligation of
confidentiality).

(b) The parties hereto shall mutually agree to the form of the initial press
releases, if any, announcing the execution of this Agreement. Subject to the
foregoing, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Representatives
not to, issue any press release or other public communications relating to the
terms of this Agreement or the Transactions or use Parent's name or refer to
Parent directly or indirectly in connection with Parent's relationship with
the Company in any media interview, advertisement, news release, press release
or professional or trade publication, or in any print media, whether or not in
response to an inquiry, without the prior written approval of Parent, unless
required by Applicable Law (as advised by legal counsel prior to any such
disclosure) and except as reasonably necessary for the Company to obtain the
Stockholder Approval and the other consents and approvals of the Stockholders
and other third parties contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement,
after the Closing, Parent shall be permitted to make such public
communications regarding this Agreement or the Transactions as Parent may
determine is reasonable and appropriate or otherwise required by Applicable
Law.

4.5 Exclusivity.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will not, and the Company will
not authorize or permit any of its Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate, seek, entertain, knowingly encourage, facilitate,
support or induce the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into,
participate in, maintain or continue any communications (except solely to
provide written notice as to the existence of these provisions) or
negotiations regarding, or deliver or make available to any Person any non-
public information with respect to, or take any other action regarding, any
inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) agree to,
accept, approve, endorse or recommend (or publicly propose or announce any
intention or desire to agree to, accept, approve, endorse or recommend) any
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent or any other
Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (v)
submit any Acquisition Proposal to the vote of any Stockholders or (vi) enter
into any other transaction or series of transactions not in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, the consummation of which
would impede, interfere with, prevent or delay, or would reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or delay, the consummation of the
Merger or the other Transactions. The Company will, and will cause its
Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted prior to or on the Agreement Date with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and (B) immediately revoke or withdraw access of any Person (other
than Parent and its Representatives) to any data room (virtual or actual)
containing any non-public information with respect to the Company in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal and request from each Person (other
than Parent and its Representatives) the prompt return or destruction of all
non-public information with respect to the Company previously provided to such
Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal. If any of the Company's
Representatives, whether in his, her or its capacity as such or in any other
capacity, takes any action that the Company is obligated pursuant to this
Section 4.5 not to 

authorize or permit such Representative to take, then the Company shall be
deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have breached this Section 4.5.

(b) The Company shall immediately (but in any event, within thirty-six (36)
hours) notify Parent orally and in writing after receipt by the Company (or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, by any of the Company's Representatives), of
(i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry, expression of interest,
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) any other notice that any Person is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or for access to any of the properties,
books or records of the Company by any Person or Persons other than Parent and
its Representatives. Such notice shall describe, except to the extent
prohibited by a confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company prior to
the Agreement Date: (A) the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request
and (B) the identity of the Person or Group making any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer, notice or request.
The Company shall keep Parent fully informed of the status and details of, and
any modification to, any such inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or
offer and any correspondence or communications related thereto and shall
provide to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of such inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal or offer and any amendments, correspondence
and communications related thereto, if it is in writing, or a reasonable
summary thereof, if it is not in writing. The Company shall provide Parent
with forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is
provided to the members of the Company's board of directors) of any meeting of
the Company's board of directors at which the board of directors is reasonably
expected to discuss any Acquisition Proposal.

4.6 Tax Matters.

(a) The Equityholders shall be liable for, and shall hold Parent and its
Affiliates harmless against, any Transfer Taxes imposed in any Tax
jurisdiction, including any state or local Tax jurisdiction, that become
payable in connection with the Transactions. The Person(s) required to do so
by Applicable Law will, at its own expense, file, or cause to be filed, in a
timely manner all necessary documents (including all Tax Returns) with respect
to all such Transfer Taxes if required by Applicable Law, and the filing party
(if not Parent) shall provide Parent with evidence satisfactory to the Parent
that such Transfer Taxes have been paid.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period the Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Service Providers to, afford the Representatives of Parent reasonable
access at all reasonable times to the Company Service Providers and
properties, offices and other facilities, and books and records of the Company
and shall furnish Parent with all financial, operating, and other data and
information as Parent may reasonably request, except to the extent such access
is not permitted by Applicable Law or not in accordance with any Public Health
Recommendation (it being acknowledged that in no event shall the Company or
Company Service Providers be required to provide physical access to any
physical or tangible properties or books and records of the Company during any
"shelter-in-place" or similar Public Health Recommendation, and provided that
"reasonable access" to Company Service Providers shall not be deemed to
include in-person access). Following the Closing, Parent and the Holder
Representative shall provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably
be requested in connection with the preparation of any financial statement,
Tax Return, audit, or other Legal Proceeding by any Governmental Body, or any
Legal Proceeding relating to Liabilities for Taxes. Such assistance shall
include making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information or explanation of material provided hereunder and shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns and supporting material.
Parent and the Holder Representative will retain and provide each other with
any records or information in their (or an Affiliate's) possession that may be
relevant to such preparation, Legal Proceeding, or determination.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) shall be required 

to provide any Tax information that it regards as privileged or confidential,
including any Tax Return of Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation). Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Holder Representative
(to the extent in its possession) agree (i) to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the Vested
Equityholders' indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to Tax
matters, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Tax Authority, and (ii) until the expiration of the Vested Equityholders'
indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to Tax matters, to give the
Holder Representative reasonable written notice prior to destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the Holder Representative so
requests, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will allow
the Holder Representative to take possession of such books and records prior
to destroying or discarding them.

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than gross
receipts, payroll, value added, sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or
related to income or payments, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period and (ii) in
the case of any gross receipts, payroll, value added, sales or use Taxes and
Taxes based upon or related to income or payments Tax, be deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on the
Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances, or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions), other than with respect to property placed in service after the
Closing, shall be allocated on a per diem basis.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent determines in good faith to correct
a Tax practice of the Company (including one relating to the filing,
reporting, withholding, or payment of any Tax) in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, any out-of-pocket costs of correcting such practice shall be deemed to
be a Pre-Closing Tax and any administrative (or other similar) proceedings
associated with such correction shall be treated as a Tax Contest.

(e) Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax
Returns that are first required to be filed on or after the Closing Date by or
with respect to the Company. All such Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be (A) prepared in accordance with the past practices of the Company
unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, as determined by Parent in its
good faith discretion, and (B) include all Transaction Deductions on the
income Tax Return of the Company for the taxable period that includes the
Closing Date to the extent permitted by Applicable Law. In the event that any
item reflected on any such income or other material Tax Return could form the
basis for a claim of indemnification against the Vested Equityholders or
otherwise reduce the amount payable to the Vested Equityholders pursuant to
the Transactions, no later than thirty (30) days before the due date of any
such income or other material Tax Return, Parent shall provide each such Tax
Return to the Holder Representative for review and shall consider in good
faith any reasonable comments provided by the Holder Representative.

(f) For all applicable Tax purposes, the parties agree to, and no party shall
file any Tax Return or otherwise take any Tax reporting position inconsistent
with, the following Tax treatment of the items specified below:

(i) Except for amounts paid in respect of Company Options and Promised Options
(which are addressed in Section 4.6(f)(ii)), the rights of the Vested
Equityholders to the Escrow Fund are intended to be treated as deferred
contingent purchase price eligible for installment treatment under Section 453
of the Code and any corresponding provision of foreign, state or local law, as 

appropriate. In no event shall the aggregate Escrow Fund proceeds payable to
Vested Equityholders in respect of shares of Capital Stock or Company Warrants
exceed an amount equal to (1) the portion of the Escrow Amount to be deposited
with respect to such Vested Equityholder's shares of Capital Stock or Company
Warrants, as applicable, multiplied by (2) the greater of (x) one-hundred five
percent (105%) or (y) one hundred percent (100%) plus five (5) times the
"Federal mid-term rate" as defined in Section 1274(d)(1) of the Code
(expressed as a percentage) in effect at the time the Escrow Amount is funded.
For the avoidance of doubt, the limitation in the preceding sentence does not
apply to any amounts released from the Escrow Amount payable in respect of
Company Options or Promised Options.

(ii) Any payments made in respect of Company Options or Promised Options
pursuant to this Agreement (A) shall be treated as compensation paid by the
Surviving Corporation or other applicable Parent Entity as and when payable to
the holder thereof (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be the Closing
Date with respect to the Expense Fund), including when released in respect of
such Company Options and Promised Options in the case of amounts released from
the Escrow Amount or the Unvested Cash, (B) shall in the case of payments in
respect of Employee Company Options and Promised Options be net of any Taxes
withheld pursuant to Section 1.8, and (C) shall, in the case of payments in
respect of Employee Company Options and Promised Options be made through the
Parent's, the Surviving Corporation's or other applicable Parent Entity's
standard payroll procedures and in the case of payments in respect of Non-
Employee Company Options be made through the Payment Agent. Any applicable
withholding Taxes in respect of the portion of the Expense Fund borne by
Vested Equityholders in respect of Company Options shall be withheld from
their portion of the Merger Consideration paid at or in connection with
Closing.

(iii) The Expense Fund shall be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Vested Equityholders on the Closing Date any Tax
withholding with respect to such deemed contribution by any Vested
Equityholder shall be satisfied from such Vested Equityholder's share of other
funds payable to such Vested Equityholder at such time and shall not reduce
the Expense Fund and the parties hereto do not expect any Tax withholding or
information reporting to be required in connection with the subsequent
distribution of any portion of the Expense Fund to the Vested Equityholders.

(iv) The entirety of the Merger Consideration, excluding any such amounts
payable in respect of Company Options or Promised Options but including any
amounts released from the Escrow Fund and including any Holdback
Consideration, shall be treated as proceeds from the sale of Capital Stock or
Company Warrants, as applicable, and none shall be allocated to any employment
agreement, or noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements or otherwise
treated as compensation unless otherwise required (A) by a change in
Applicable Law after the Agreement Date or (B) by a Tax Authority following a
Tax Contest in which the foregoing Tax treatment was defended by the
applicable taxpayer in good faith.

4.7 Employee Compensation Matters.

(a) The Company shall cause its board of directors adopt resolutions to
terminate each of the Employee Benefit Plans, or the Company's employer
participation in each of the multiple employer Employee Benefit Plans, that
are intended to be qualified within the meaning of Sections 401(a) and 401(k)
of the Code (collectively, the "401(k) Plan") with such termination to be
effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, unless Parent
provides written notice to the Company no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date that one (1) or more of such Employee Benefit Plans
shall not be terminated. Such 

resolutions will be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. The Company also
shall take other actions in furtherance of terminating such Employee Benefit
Plans as Parent may reasonably require.

(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
Optionholder to execute an Option Consent prior to the Closing.

(c) Parent will issue restricted stock units to the persons set forth under
the heading "New Retention Grants" on Exhibit N attached hereto in the amounts
and subject to the terms set forth therein at the first regularly scheduled
meeting of the compensation committee of Parent's board of directors to occur
after the Closing, but in any event no later than September 30, 2020.

4.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall deliver prompt notice
to Parent of:

(a) The material breach of the representations and warranties contained in
Article II (provided that the failure to deliver such prompt notice shall only
be considered a breach of this covenant if the Company had actual Knowledge of
such breach without any duty of inquiry);

(b) any material failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder;

(c) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event that would be reasonably
likely to result in any of the conditions in Article V not being satisfied;
and

(d) (i) any Legal Proceeding initiated by or against it, or known by the
Company to be threatened against the Company, or any Company Service Providers
or current or former Stockholders in their capacity as such (a "New Litigation
Claim") and (ii) ongoing material developments in any New Litigation Claim or
any litigation Claim pending against the Company as of the Agreement Date.

(e) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 4.8 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available to Parent hereunder. The Company will
consult in good faith with Parent regarding the conduct of the defense of any
New Litigation Claim.

4.9 Promised Options. Prior to the Closing, in consultation with Parent, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each Person who holds a
Promised Option to execute a non-revocable waiver and consent in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F (a "Promised Option Waiver"). All agreements,
notices, or other documents prepared by the Company in connection with the
Promised Options shall be subject to the prior review, comment, and approval
of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed).

4.10 Section 280G Matters.

(a) The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent, prior to soliciting the
vote of the Stockholders with respect to the 280G Proposal, an executed
parachute payment waiver, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
K (the "Parachute Payment Waiver") from each Person who is or reasonably could
be, with respect to the Company, a "disqualified individual" (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code), as determined immediately prior to the
initiation of the Stockholder solicitation required by this Section 4.10, and
who reasonably might otherwise receive, have received, or have the right or
entitlement to receive an excess parachute payment under Section 280G of the
Code. 

(b) The Company shall solicit the vote of the Stockholders in accordance with
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (the "280G Proposal") so as to render, (i)
if an affirmative vote is not obtained, the excess parachute payments that
have been waived pursuant to the executed Parachute Payment Waivers will not
be retained or received or (ii) if an affirmative vote is obtained, the
parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the Code inapplicable to any
and all payments and benefits provided pursuant to Contracts that, in the
absence of the executed Parachute Payment Waivers by the affected Persons
under Section 4.10(a), could otherwise reasonably result, individually or in
the aggregate, in the payment of any amount or the provision of any benefit
that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code, with such
Stockholder approval to be solicited in a manner that satisfies all applicable
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, including Q-7 of Section
1.280G-1 of the Treasury Regulations. The results of such vote shall be
provided promptly to Parent prior to the Closing. The documentation
constituting the 280G Proposal shall be subject to Parent's prior review and
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) In addition, the Company has received the offer letters and employment
agreements provided to any "disqualified individual" by Parent or any Parent
Entity or at the direction of Parent or any Parent Entity, in each case prior
to or on the Closing Date and that could reasonably be expected to be taken
into account in determining whether any payments and benefits constitute
"parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code with respect to any
such Person in connection with the Transactions.

4.11 Stockholder Approval Matters.

(a) The Company shall as promptly as practicable after the Stockholder
Approval is obtained, and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the
Agreement Date:

(i) use its reasonable best efforts to cause each Stockholder whose consent
was not obtained in connection with obtaining the Stockholder Approval to
execute the Joinder Agreement;

(ii) deliver notice to the Stockholders of the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger and the other Transactions by the Stockholders, as
required by and pursuant to and in accordance with the DGCL and Certificate of
Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Company; and

(iii) provide to each Stockholder whose consent was not obtained in connection
with obtaining the Stockholder Approval a notice comprising (A) the notice
contemplated by Section 228(e) of the DGCL of the taking of a corporate action
without a meeting by less than a unanimous written consent, (B) the notice
contemplated by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL, together with a copy of Section

and the other Operative Documents, and the recommendation of the board of
directors of the Company that all of the Stockholders adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger, the other Operative Documents and the Transactions, in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and satisfying all requirements of the
DGCL (as amended or supplemented, the "Information Statement").

(b) Any materials to be submitted to the Stockholders in connection with the
solicitation of their adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger
and the other Transactions, including any amendments or supplements to the
Information Statement (the "Soliciting Materials"), shall be subject to review
and written approval by Parent (which shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed), and shall 

include information regarding the Company, the terms of the Merger, this
Agreement, and the other Operative Documents, and the recommendation of the
board of directors of the Company that all of the Stockholders adopt this
Agreement and approve the Merger, the other Operative Documents and the
Transactions. The Company will promptly advise Parent in writing if at any
time prior to the Closing the Company obtains Knowledge of any facts that
might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the Soliciting
Materials in order to make the statements contained or incorporated by
reference therein not misleading or to comply with Applicable Law.

4.12 RandW Policy. Parent has bound, concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, an insurance policy with respect to the representations and
warranties of the Company under this Agreement, a true and correct copy of
which has been provided to the Company (the "RandW Policy").

(a) The Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent a spreadsheet (the

holder of a Promised Option that is not a Substitution Promised Option;

(v) for each holder of a Substitution Promised Option, a calculation of the

Company Closing Financial Certificate and the Spreadsheet not later than four
(4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and a final version of the Company

the Company that there are reasonably apparent errors in the drafts of the
Company Closing Financial Certificate or the Spreadsheet delivered not later

shall discuss such errors in good faith and the Company shall correct such
errors prior to delivering the final versions of the same in accordance with

(a) If the Merger is consummated, then until the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Closing Date, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and

agreements with the Company in effect on the Agreement Date and set forth on
Schedule 4.14 of the Disclosure Letter pursuant to the Certificate of
Incorporation or the Bylaws, in each case, in effect on the Agreement Date
(the "Company Indemnification Provisions"), with respect to Claims arising out
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time that are
asserted after the Effective Time; provided that Parent's and the Surviving
Corporation 's obligations under this Section 4.14(a) shall not apply to (i)
any Claim or matter that relates to a willful or intentional breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation made by or of the
Company in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or (ii) any
Claim based on a Claim for indemnification made by an Indemnified Party
pursuant to Article VII. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
the Company Indemnification Provisions, no Company Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to coverage under any Parent director and officer insurance policy or
errors and omission policy unless such Company Indemnified Party is separately
eligible for coverage under such policy pursuant to Parent's policies and
procedures and the terms of such insurance policy.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a prepaid tail
insurance coverage (the "DandO Tail") for the Company Indemnified Parties in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Parent, which shall provide the Company
Indemnified Parties with coverage for six (6) years following the Closing Date
in an amount not less than the existing coverage and that shall have other
terms not materially less favorable to the insured persons than the directors'

DandO Tail in full force and effect and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

(each, an "Additional Employee Offer Letter"), (ii) a CIIA, and (iii) if such
individual holds a Company Option or Promised Option, an Option Consent or
Promised Option Waiver, in each case effective as of the Closing (together,
the "Additional Employee Documents"), and no less than five of individuals
executing such Additional Employee Documents shall (x) be able to commence
employment under his or her Additional Employee Offer Letter upon the Closing,
(y) not have notified Parent or the Company that he or she is terminating (or
expressed to Parent or the Company an intention to terminate) his or her
employment with the Company and (z) not have stated to Parent or the Company
an intent to revoke, rescind, or repudiate any Additional Employee Document.

have experienced a Material Adverse Effect that is continuing.

applicable rulings and regulations thereunder and Section 4.12. As of the
Closing, there shall be no payments or benefits payable to any "disqualified
individual" of the Company (determined in accordance with Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations and authorities promulgated thereunder) that the
Company, subject to Parent's reasonable approval, determines may constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, "parachute payments" under Section 280G of
the Code (including because such payments or benefits either (a) are exempt
from the definition of "parachute payment" pursuant to valid Stockholder
solicitation and approval of the 280G Proposal carried out in accordance in
all applicable respects with Section 4.12 and Section 280G of the Code and
applicable rulings and regulations thereunder or (b) are no longer payable
pursuant to (i) valid and irrevocable Parachute Payment Waivers of such
payments by such disqualified individuals (which waivers remain in effect as
of immediately prior to the Closing) made in accordance in all applicable
respects with Section 4.12 and Section 280G of the Code and applicable rulings
and regulations thereunder and (ii) a failure to obtain a valid Stockholder
Approval of the 280G Proposal).

connection with, the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction (or waiver
by the Company) of the following conditions:

6.1 Accuracy of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained herein and in the other
Operative Documents shall have been true and correct in all material respects
when made and shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the
Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date.

6.4 Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agreement shall have been duly executed by

ARTICLE VII 
INDEMNIFICATION

7.1 Survival.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement or any other Operative Document or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto shall survive for a period of twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date (the "General Survival Period") (or, solely for purposes of
Claims made under the RandW Policy and not against the Escrow Fund or the Vested
Equityholders, such longer period as specified in the RandW Policy), except that
any Indemnification Claim based on Fraud by or on behalf of the Company in
making any representation or warranty under this Agreement shall survive for
seven years after 

the Closing Date. The expiration of any representation and warranty of the
Company shall not affect any Indemnification Claim for breaches of
representations or warranties of the Company with respect to the matters set
forth in a corresponding written Claim Notice if a written Claim Notice with
respect to such indemnification claim is delivered in accordance with Section
7.4 below prior to the expiration date of such representation and warranty.

(b) The representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time.

(c) The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or in any other
Operative Documents will survive until performed in accordance with their
terms, but no right to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII in respect
of any Indemnification Claim based upon any breach of a covenant or agreement
shall be affected by the expiration of such covenant or agreement.

7.2 Indemnification by the Vested Equityholders.

(a) From and after the Closing and by virtue of the Merger, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article VII, the Vested Equityholders shall (i)
jointly (to the extent of the funds then available in the Escrow Fund) and
(ii) severally (based on their respective Pro Rata Share) as to any amounts
exceeding the funds then available in the Escrow Fund, indemnify, defend, and
hold Parent and its officers, directors, employees, agents, and Affiliates
(each, an "Indemnified Party") harmless from and against, and shall reimburse
the Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them directly or indirectly
(whether or not involving a Third-Party Claim), arising out of, resulting
from, or in connection with:

(i) any breach of any representation, warranty, or certification made by or on
behalf of the Company in this Agreement together with the Disclosure Letter or
in any other Operative Document (A) as of the Agreement Date or (B) as of the
Closing Date as though such representation, warranty, or certification were
made as of the Closing Date (except to the extent that such representations,
warranties, and certifications speak only as of an earlier date, in which case
such representations, warranties, and certifications shall be true and correct
as of such earlier date);

(ii) any breach prior to the Closing by the Company of any covenant or other
obligation in this Agreement or in any other Operative Document;

(iii) any and all unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes if and to the extent not otherwise
accounted for in Debt or Transaction Costs and included in the calculation of
Merger Consideration;

(iv) any inaccuracy in the Company Closing Financial Certificate (other than
an inaccuracy that would not affect the calculation of the Merger
Consideration) or the Spreadsheet;

(v) any Transaction Litigation or Claims by any former holder (or purported
holder) of any Equity Interests of the Company (including any predecessors),
arising out of, resulting from or in connection with the allocation of the
Merger Consideration or any portion thereof that differs from that specified
on the Spreadsheet; 

(vi) any claims with respect to Dissenting Shares and any payments made with
respect to Dissenting Shares to the extent that such payments exceed the
amounts that otherwise would have been payable pursuant to Section 1.6.1 in
respect of such Dissenting Shares if appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL had not been exercised with respect thereto; or

(vii) any Fraud committed by or on behalf of the Company in making any
representation or warranty in this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII, each Vested
Equityholder shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify, defend, and hold the
Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, and shall reimburse the
Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses, directly or indirectly, arising
out of, resulting from, or in connection with:

(i) any breach of any representation and warranty made by such Vested
Equityholder in his, her, or its Joinder Agreement or Option Consent (A) as of
the date of execution of such Joinder Agreement or Option Consent or (B) as of
the Closing Date as though such representation and warranty were made as of
the Closing Date;

(ii) any breach of any representation, warranty, or certification made by such
Vested Equityholder in his, her, or its Letter of Transmittal, Warrant
Termination Agreement, or any other Operative Document;

(iii) any breach by such Vested Equityholder of any covenant or other
obligation in this Agreement or in any other Operative Document;

(iv) any Released Claim (as defined in the applicable Joinder Agreement or
Option Consent) of such Vested Equityholder; or

(v) any Fraud committed by such Vested Equityholder in their personal capacity
and not by or on behalf of the Company in making any representation or
warranty in this Agreement or in the Operative Documents.

For the avoidance of doubt, no representation or warranty made in this
Agreement is made by a Vested Equityholder in its personal capacity. The
Indemnified Parties shall have the option of seeking satisfaction for any
indemnification obligations of such Vested Equityholder pursuant to this
Section 7.2(b) directly against such Vested Equityholder and/or out of such
Vested Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Fund.

7.3 Limitations and Adjustments.

(a) Except for Losses under Section 7.2(a)(vii) and Section 7.2(b)(v), the
aggregate liability of the Vested Equityholders for all Indemnification Claims
shall be limited to the Escrow Fund.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to make an Indemnification Claim for Losses arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with the matters listed in Section 7.2(a)(i),
(other than for Fraud or any breach of any Fundamental Representation) unless
and until a Claim Notice (together with any other delivered Claim Notices)
describing Losses in an aggregate amount greater than $2,000,000 (the
"Deductible") is delivered, in which case the Indemnified Party may 

make Indemnification Claims and receive cash from the Escrow Fund for Losses
solely to the extent in excess of the Deductible for such matters.

(c) Each Vested Equityholder shall be liable only for such Vested
Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of the Losses finally determined under this
Agreement to be indemnifiable for such Indemnification Claim, and in no event
shall the liability of any Vested Equityholder for any and all Indemnification
Claims in the aggregate under Section 7.2 or otherwise arising under or
relating to this Agreement and the Transactions exceed the amount of Merger
Consideration received by such Vested Equityholder (including any funds from
the Escrow Fund); provided that nothing in this Section 7.3(c) shall limit the
liability of any Vested Equityholder for any and all Indemnification Claims
under Section 7.2(a)(vii) and/or Section 7.2(b)(v) if the Vested Equityholder
committed the Fraud underlying such Indemnification Claim.

(d) For purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred and the amount
of Losses under Section 7.2, all qualifications and limitations as to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, and words of similar import shall be
disregarded; provided that in no event shall (x) "Material Contract" be read
to mean "Contract," (y) "material" be read out of "all material respects" in
Section 2.5(a), or (z) the term "Material Adverse Effect" be read out of
Section 2.6(a).

(e) The representations and warranties of the Company and the Vested
Equityholders contained in this Agreement, any other Operative Document, or in
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall not be deemed waived,
modified, or otherwise affected, nor shall the survival of any such
representations and warranties be deemed reduced, truncated, or otherwise
limited, by any investigation made or any knowledge possessed or acquired by
Parent or by any of its directors, officers, employees, consultants, or agents
(or that could have been discovered by any of the foregoing, whether by any
investigation made by or on behalf of Parent into the affairs of the Company
or otherwise) prior to the Closing with respect to (i) the truth and accuracy
of any such representations and warranties or (ii) any facts, matters, or
circumstances that may give rise to an Indemnification Claim, and no
Indemnification Claim made hereunder shall be limited on the basis thereof.

(f) The amount of Losses related to any Indemnification Claim shall be paid to
the applicable Indemnified Party in full, without any set off, counterclaim,
restriction, or condition and without any deduction or withholding (except as
may be required by Applicable Law or as otherwise agreed).

(g) The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
Article VII shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments or reimbursements actually received by the
Indemnified Parties from third parties (other than the Vested Equityholders)
in respect of such Losses (net of any costs or expenses incurred in obtaining
such insurance, indemnification or reimbursement, including any increases in
insurance premiums or retro-premium adjustments resulting from such recovery,
except with respect to the RandW Policy); provided that nothing in this Section
7.3(g) shall be construed as or give rise to an obligation to seek any such
insurance, indemnification or reimbursement, including under the RandW Policy.
If an Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance
policies or third party indemnification or reimbursement payments subsequent
to its receipt of an indemnification payment by the Vested Equityholders
(including via the Escrow Fund), then such Indemnified Party will, without
duplication, promptly reimburse the Vested Equityholders (including via the
Escrow Fund) for any payment made by such Vested Equityholders up to the
amount received by the Indemnified Party.

(h) If an Indemnification Claim may be properly characterized in multiple ways
in accordance with this Article VII such that such Indemnification Claim may
or may not be subject to different limitations 

depending on such characterization, then the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to characterize such Indemnification Claim in a manner that maximizes
the recovery and time to assert such Indemnification Claim permitted in
accordance with this Article VII. All Losses under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery due to the facts giving rise to
such Losses constituting a breach of more than one (1) representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision.

(i) This Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Parties against the Vested Equityholders from and after the Effective Time for
any Claims arising in connection with the Transactions under this Agreement or
under any Operative Document; provided that (i) this Section 7.3(i) shall not
be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or
injunctive relief and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability
of a Vested Equityholder (and this Article VII shall not be the sole and
exclusive remedy for such Indemnified Party) for Fraud under Section
7.2(a)(vii) or Section 7.2(b)(v), if such Vested Equityholder committed such
Fraud. The conditions and limitations set forth in this Article VII will apply
even if (1) the RandW Policy is revoked, cancelled or modified in any manner
after issuance or (2) Parent makes a claim under the RandW Policy and such claim
is denied by the insurer.

7.4 Procedure for Indemnification.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 7.4, the period during which
(i) Indemnification Claims may be made (except for Indemnification Claims
under Section 7.2(a)(vii) or Section 7.2(b)(v)) shall be the General Survival
Period, (ii) Indemnification Claims may be made under Section 7.2(b)(i)-(iv)
shall be the date that is three years from the Closing Date and (iii)
Indemnification Claims may be made under Section 7.2(a)(vii) and Section
7.2(b)(v) shall be seven (7) years from the Closing Date (together with the
General Survival Period, the "Survival Periods" and each, a "Survival
Period").

(b) An Indemnified Party shall, prior to the expiration of the applicable
Survival Period with respect to an Indemnification Claim, give written notice
(a "Claim Notice") of any Indemnification Claim by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Party to the Holder Representative, reasonably promptly, but in
any event if such Indemnification Claim relates to the assertion against an
Indemnified Party of any Third-Party Claim, within fifteen (15) Business Days
after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of a Legal
Proceeding relating to such Third-Party Claim, except that the failure to so
notify the Holder Representative within such time period shall not relieve the
Vested Equityholders of any obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
under this Article VII, except to the extent that the ability of the Holder
Representative to resolve such Indemnification Claim is materially and
adversely affected by such delay or failure. Each Claim Notice shall (i) state
that an Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered or sustained, or
reasonably anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or sustain Losses, (ii)
describe (A) the amount of claimed Losses in reasonable detail (to the extent
known and reasonably quantifiable by Parent), and (B) the basis for such
anticipated Loss, and, if applicable, the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related. Parent may
update a Claim Notice from time to time to reflect any change in circumstances
following the date thereof. Following the delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Holder Representative and its representatives and agents shall be given all
such access (including electronic access, to the extent available) to the
books and records of the Surviving Corporation and reasonable access during
normal business hours to such personnel or other representatives of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent, in each case as they may reasonably require
for the purposes of investigating or resolving any disputes relating to, or
responding to, any matters or inquiries raised in the Claim Notice.

(c) Unless the Holder Representative contests the Indemnification Claim in
writing delivered to Parent within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of
a Claim Notice and describing in reasonable detail the basis for contesting
the Indemnification Claim (an "Indemnification Claim Objection Notice"), 

the Indemnified Party shall, subject to the other terms of this Article VII,
be paid the amount of Losses related to such Indemnification Claim or the
uncontested portion thereof. Any disputed Indemnification Claims shall be
resolved either (i) in a written agreement signed by Parent and the Holder
Representative or (ii) by the final, non-appealable decision of a court
resolving such disputed Indemnification Claim (a "Final Order").

(d) In the event that the Holder Representative shall timely deliver an
Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(c), the
Holder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims for a
period of at least sixty (60) days. If the Holder Representative and Parent
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
and signed by both parties and, in the case of an Indemnification Claim to be
recovered from the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent (a
"Joint Memorandum"). If Parent and the Holder Representative cannot reach such
an agreement, then either party may pursue a claim subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 9.6 to obtain a Final Order. The Escrow Agent will not
distribute any disputed amount except pursuant to a Joint Memorandum or Final
Order; and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any
Joint Memorandum or Final Order and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms thereof.

7.5 Third-Party Claims. In the event that Parent becomes aware of a Third-
Party Claim that Parent in good faith believes may result in a Claim for
Losses by or on behalf of an Indemnified Party, Parent shall deliver a Claim
Notice to the Holder Representative in accordance with Section 7.4(b) and
shall provide a copy of any material written correspondence submitted by the
third party making such Third-Party Claim, if any, within fifteen (15)
Business Days of receipt of such material correspondence. Parent shall have
the right in its sole discretion to determine and conduct the defense of such
Third-Party Claim; provided, that the Holder Representative, at the expense of
the Vested Equityholders, shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third-Party Claim and engage separate counsel, and Parent shall keep
Holder Representative reasonably informed concerning the progress of such
Third-Party Claim and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the
Holder Representative with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim.
Parent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to settle or otherwise
resolve such Third-Party Claim and the costs and expenses incurred by Parent
or its Affiliates in connection with defense, enforcement, settlement, or
resolution (including reasonable documented out-of-pocket attorneys' fees,
other professionals' and experts' fees, and court or arbitration costs) shall
be included in the Losses for which Parent shall be entitled to receive
indemnification pursuant to an Indemnification Claim made hereunder, and such
costs and expenses shall constitute Losses subject to indemnification under
Section 7.2 (subject to the limitations under this Article VII) regardless of
whether it is ultimately determined that such Third-Party Claim arose out of,
resulted from, or was in connection with a matter listed under Section 7.2;
provided that no settlement of any such Third-Party Claim with third party
claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses with respect to such
settlement unless (i) the Holder Representative consents to the amount of such
settlement or (ii) unreasonably withholds, conditions or delays such consent.
The Holder Representative shall have the right to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices, and communications with respect to such Third-Party Claim
to the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege
relating to any Indemnified Party, subject to execution by the Holder
Representative of a customary non-disclosure agreement with Parent (and, if
required, such third party) to the extent that such materials contain
confidential or propriety information except that, in the case of a Tax
Contest, the Holder Representative shall only have the right to receive copies
of any written correspondence from a Tax Authority and the failure to provide
any such copies shall not relieve any Vested Equityholder of any obligation or
liability to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Holder
Representative demonstrates that it or any such Vested Equityholder is
materially and adversely affected thereby. In the event that the Holder
Representative has consented in writing to the amount of any settlement or
resolution by Parent of any such Claim (which consent shall not be
unreasonably 

withheld, conditioned or delayed and which consent shall be deemed to have
been given unless the Holder Representative shall have objected within twenty
(20) days after a written request therefor by Parent) or the Holder
Representative has been determined to have unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed its consent to the amount of any such settlement or resolution,
neither the Holder Representative nor any Vested Equityholder shall have any
power or authority to object under this Article VII to the amount of the
Indemnification Claim by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party against the
Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement or resolution.

7.6 Holder Representative.

(a) By the approval of the Merger by the Stockholder Approval, or by execution
of a Joinder Agreement, an Option Consent, or a Warrant Termination Agreement,
or by participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof,
including the right to receive the consideration payable in connection with
the Merger, each Vested Equityholder shall have irrevocably (except as set
forth in Section 7.6(b)) authorized and appointed Shareholder Representative
Services LLC (together with any replacement representative appointed pursuant
to Section 7.6(a), (the "Holder Representative")), with full power of
substitution, as such Vested Equityholder's representative and attorney-in-
fact and agent to act for such Vested Equityholder with respect to all matters
arising in connection with this Agreement and the Operative Documents (other
than such Vested Equityholder's Offer Letter and CIAA, if any), including full
power and authority, exercisable in the sole discretion of the Holder
Representative, to: (i) take any action contemplated to be taken by the Vested
Equityholders under this Agreement or any other Operative Document, (ii)
negotiate, determine, defend, and settle any disputes that may arise under or
in connection with this Agreement or any other Operative Document, and (iii)
make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any releases, assurances, receipts,
requests, instructions, notices, agreements, certificates, and any other
instruments, and generally do any and all things and take any and all actions
that the Holder Representative may deem necessary or advisable in connection
with this Agreement or any other Operative Document.

(b) The Holder Representative may be removed by written agreement among Parent
and Vested Equityholders representing a majority in interest of the Vested
Equityholders calculated with reference to each Vested Equityholder's Pro Rata
Share. The Holder Representative may resign at any time upon giving twenty
(20) days' prior written notice of such resignation to Parent and the Vested
Equityholder advisory committee established under the Holder Representative's
engagement letter, but shall be entitled to exercise all of the powers
enumerated in Section 7.6(a) until the effective date of such resignation. In
the event of such removal or resignation, or upon the death or disability of,
the Holder Representative, Vested Equityholders representing a majority in
interest of the Vested Equityholders calculated with reference to each Vested
Equityholder's Pro Rata Share shall promptly agree upon a replacement Holder
Representative and shall notify Parent thereof. Any Survival Period set forth
in Section 7.1 any period in which any Indemnified Party is required to
provide notice to the Holder Representative with respect to any
Indemnification Claim or action to be taken in connection with this Agreement
shall be deemed to be extended by the number of calendar days that elapses
between the Holder Representative's resignation, removal, death, or disability
and the appointment of a replacement Holder Representative pursuant to the
preceding sentence (the "Gap Period"), if such Survival Period would otherwise
expire or such notice would otherwise be required to be provided or such
action to be taken during the Gap Period.

(c) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a payment spreadsheet (a "Payment Spreadsheet"), in
form and substance acceptable to Parent and the Payment Agent, setting forth
(in each case to the extent applicable) payees, certificate numbers, share
classes or series and quantities, payment amounts, email (where available) and
physical addresses, together with any additional information requested by the
Payment Agent. Following the Closing Date, the Holder 

Representative agrees to deliver a revised Payment Spreadsheet to Parent in
connection with any subsequent distributions to the Vested Equityholders
pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) The Holder Representative will incur no liability of any kind with respect
to any action or omission by the Holder Representative in connection with its
services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto,
except in the event of liability directly resulting from the Holder
Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Holder
Representative shall not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the
advice of counsel. The Vested Equityholders shall severally based on their
respective Pro Rata Shares (provided, that in all cases the indemnity coverage
provided to the Holder Representative shall sum to one hundred percent (100%))
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Holder Representative from and against
any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses")
arising out of or in connection with the Holder Representative's execution and
performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in
the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Holder Representative, the Holder Representative will reimburse the Vested
Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent
attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid
directly to the Holder Representative by the Vested Equityholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Holder Representative from (i)
the funds in the Expense Fund and (ii) any other funds that become payable to
the Vested Equityholders under this Agreement at such time as such amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Vested Equityholders; provided that
while this section allows the Holder Representative to be paid from the
aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Vested
Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses
as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Holder
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
In no event will the Holder Representative be required to advance its own
funds on behalf of the Vested Equityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on
liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the
recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Vested Equityholders

Equityholder, on the other hand, is then in breach of this Agreement or any

breach by Parent, or the Company, in the case of such a breach by the Company
or any Equityholder, may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(b);

or breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Company of written notice of such inaccuracy or breach and, if not cured
within such period and at or prior to the Closing, such inaccuracy or breach
would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article V to
be satisfied; provided that no such cure period shall be available or
applicable to any such breach that by its nature cannot be cured;

(d) by the Company, by written notice to Parent, if there shall have been an
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by, or a breach of any
covenant, agreement or obligation of, Parent herein and such inaccuracy or
breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after receipt by

9.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such determination that any term or other 

provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties to the fullest extent possible.

9.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Letter and all
other Exhibits and Schedules hereto), the other Operative Documents, and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
(but not concurrent) agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof, except that nothing herein shall supersede any provision of any Offer
Letter, CIAA, or other employment agreement between any Parent Entity and any
Employee Equityholder.

9.5 Assignment; Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
operation of law or otherwise, and any such assignment shall be null and void,
except that any or all rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub may be
assigned to one (1) or more Parent Entities, so long as such assignment does
not relieve Parent and Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject
to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding on and inure solely to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, legal
representatives and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement (except that (x) Article VII is intended to benefit the Indemnified
Parties and (y) Section 4.14 is intended to benefit the Company Indemnified
Parties).

9.6 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law, provision,
or rule that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction. In
any action among or between any of the parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, including any action seeking equitable relief, each of the
parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Wilmington,
Delaware. Each party hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in
any Legal Proceeding (whether based on Contract, tort, or otherwise) arising
out of or relating to this Agreement and the other Operative Documents, the
Transactions, or the actions of such parties in the negotiation,
administration, performance, and enforcement hereof and thereof.

9.7 Headings; Construction. The table of contents and headings contained in
this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The parties
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any
reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign statute or Applicable Law
shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. For purposes of Article II,
any reference to the "Company" shall include any predecessor entity. The word
"including" shall mean including without limitation. The word "or" is
disjunctive, but not necessarily exclusive. The words "hereof," "herein,"
"hereunder," and similar terms in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a
whole, including exhibits and schedules hereto, and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Annexes, Articles, Exhibits, Sections, or Schedules, such reference shall be
to an Annex, Article, Exhibit, Section, or Schedule to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. For purposes of Article II, the words "provide,"
"deliver," "made available," "furnish," and similar terms in this Agreement
shall mean provide in that certain virtual data room titled "Project
Snowflake" on datasite.com at least one (1) Business Day prior to the
Agreement Date (or, solely for those documents listed on Schedule B to the 

Disclosure Letter, prior to the execution of this Agreement on the Agreement
Date) and not removed from such virtual data room prior to the Closing Date.
Pronouns in the masculine, feminine, and neuter genders shall be construed to
include any other gender, and words in the singular form shall be construed to
include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires. If
any party has breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained
herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation,
warranty, or covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the
relative levels of specificity) that the party has not breached shall not
detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first
representation, warranty, or covenant. All accounting terms used herein and
not expressly defined herein shall, except as otherwise noted, have the
meanings assigned to such terms in accordance with GAAP. References to clauses
without a cross-reference to a Section or subsection are references to clauses
with the same Section or, if more specific, subsection. The symbol "$" refers
to United States Dollars. All references to "days" shall be to calendar days
unless otherwise indicated as a "Business Day." Any action otherwise required
to be taken on a day that is not a Business Day shall instead be taken on the
next succeeding Business Day, and if the last day of such period is a non-
Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business
Day. Unless indicated otherwise, all mathematical calculations contemplated by
this Agreement shall be rounded to the tenth decimal place, except in respect
of payments, which shall be rounded to the nearest whole United States cent.

9.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered in one (1) or
more counterparts, either manually or electronically (including by PDF and
electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which together shall constitute one (1) and the same agreement. No counterpart
shall be effective unless and until each party has executed at least one (1)
counterpart.

9.9 Remedies. Each of Parent, the Company and the Holder Representative
acknowledges and agrees that the other would be damaged irreparably if any
provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific
terms or otherwise is breached. Accordingly, each of Parent, the Company and
the Holder Representative agrees that the other such parties shall be entitled
to an injunction to prevent breaches of any provision of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy available at law or in equity.

9.10 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified, or supplemented at
any time, but only pursuant to an instrument in writing signed by Parent and
(a) prior to the Closing, the Company or (b) following the Closing, the Holder
Representative, and any such amendment shall be binding on all parties hereto
and the Equityholders.

9.11 Waiver. Parent may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
obligation of the Company, any Equityholder, or the Holder Representative
under this Agreement or any other Operative Document, (b) waive any inaccuracy
in the representations and warranties of the Company or any Equityholder
contained in this Agreement or any other Operative Document (which waiver will
not in any manner affect the rights of the Indemnified Parties under Article
VII), or (c) waive compliance by the Company, any Equityholder, or the Holder
Representative with any agreement or condition contained in this Agreement or
any other Operative Document (which waiver will not in any manner affect the
rights of the Indemnified Parties under Article VII). The Holder
Representative (if after the Closing) or the Company (if prior to the Closing)
may (i) extend the time for the performance of any obligation of Parent or
Merger Sub under this Agreement or any other Operative Document, (ii) waive
any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement or any other Operative Document, or (iii) waive
compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any agreement or condition contained
in this Agreement or any other Operative Document. Any extension or waiver
contemplated in this Section 9.11 shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by Parent or the Holder Representative (or, prior
to the 

Closing, the Company), as applicable, and shall apply only as set forth in
such instrument and shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect
to, any failure to comply with any other obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition contained herein. Any extension or waiver by the Holder
Representative (or, prior to the Closing, the Company) shall be binding on the
Company, each Equityholder, and the Holder Representative.

9.12 Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege. If the Holder Representative so desires,
acting on behalf of the Vested Equityholders and without the need for any
consent or waiver by Company, Parent, or Merger Sub, Cooley LLP ("Cooley")
shall be permitted to represent the Vested Equityholders (through the Holder
Representative) after the Closing in connection with any dispute relating to
this Agreement and/or any of the transactions contemplated hereunder. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company further agree that, as to all communications among
Cooley and the Holder Representative and the Vested Equityholders and their
respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "Seller Group") that
relate to Cooley's representation of the Company in the transactions
contemplated hereunder (but not representations prior to engagement for or
separate from such transactions), the attorney-client privilege and the
exception of client confidence belongs solely to the Seller Group and may be
controlled only by the Seller Group and shall not pass to or be claimed, or
deemed waived, by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company. This right to the
attorney client privilege shall exist even if such communications may exist on
Company's computer system or in documents in Company's possession.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent and its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), and a
Person other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, Parent and its
subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), may access such materials
and assert (but not waive) the attorney-client privilege.
