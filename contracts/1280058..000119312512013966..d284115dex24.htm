ARTICLE II

THE OFFER

Section 2.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that the Company has fulfilled its obligation to provide
information to Parent and Merger Sub on a timely basis as contemplated by
_Section 2.1(e)_, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof.

(b) The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment, purchase and pay for
any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to (i) the
Minimum Condition and (ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto.
Merger Sub expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) at any
time or from time to time, in its sole discretion, to waive any such
condition (other than the Minimum Condition), to increase the price per
Company Share payable in the Offer, and to make any other changes in the terms
and conditions of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that without the prior
written consent of the Company no change may be made that (i) decreases the
price per Company Share payable in the Offer, (ii) changes the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduces the maximum number
of Company Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) adds to the
conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto, (v) extends the Offer
other than as set forth in this _Section 2.1_, or (vi) modifies or
amends any condition to the Offer in any manner materially adverse to the
holders of Company Shares.

(c) The Offer initially shall be scheduled to expire twenty (20) Business
Days following (and including, if it is a Business Day, the day of) the
commencement thereof (the " _Expiration Date_ ," unless extended in accordance
with this subsection (c), in which case any expiration time and date
established pursuant to an authorized extension of the Offer in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, shall be the Expiration Date).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Merger Sub (i) at
the written request of the Company, shall, and Parent shall then cause Merger
Sub to, from time to time extend the Offer, in increments of no more than ten
(10) Business Days each, if at the initial or any subsequent scheduled
Expiration Date of the Offer any of the conditions to Merger Subs obligation
to accept Company Shares for payment shall not be satisfied or waived, but
each such condition is reasonably capable of being satisfied at or prior to
the Outside Date, until such time as such conditions are satisfied or waived
to the extent permitted by this Agreement, (ii) shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation or interpretation of the SEC, or the staff thereof, applicable to
the Offer, or (iii) may extend the Offer one time for up to five (5) Business
Days if all of the conditions to Merger Subs obligation to accept for payment
Company Shares are satisfied or waived, but the number of Company Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer is less than ninety
percent (90%) of the then outstanding

 



12  Company Shares on a fully diluted basis at the otherwise scheduled
Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such extension provided for
in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. In
each of the above cases, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to extend the Offer
from time to time in accordance with this _Section 2.1(c)_ for the shortest
time periods which it reasonably believes are necessary until consummation of
the Offer if the conditions of the Offer shall not have been satisfied or
waived, so long as this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Article VIII_ hereof.

 

(d) The Per Share Amount shall, subject to applicable withholding of Taxes, be
net to the seller of Company Shares in cash, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of the Offer. Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, pay the Per Share Amount for all Company Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn promptly following the acceptance of Company Shares for payment
in accordance with the terms of the Offer (the date and time of acceptance for
payment of such Company Shares, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). If payment of the
Per Share Amount is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing Company Shares is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition
of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Per Share Amount to a Person other than the registered holder
of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Merger Sub that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable.

(e) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, and
conditioned on Companys having fulfilled its obligation to provide
information to Parent and Merger Sub on a timely basis as contemplated by
this _Section 2.1(e)_, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect
to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate by reference
an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") and forms of the related
letter of transmittal and any related summary advertisement (the Schedule TO,
the Offer to Purchase and such other documents, together with all exhibits,
supplements and amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as
the " _Offer Documents_ "). Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Company Shares in all material respects to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents to comply
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of federal
securities laws. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct promptly
any information provided by any of them for use in the Offer Documents that
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and
Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO,
as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as
so corrected, to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case in
all material respects as required by applicable federal securities laws. The
Company shall as promptly as practicable furnish to Merger Sub or Parent all
information concerning the Company that is required by applicable federal
securities laws or reasonably requested by Merger Sub or Parent in connection
with their obligations relating to the Offer Documents or any action
contemplated by this _Section 2.1(e)_. Parent and Merger Sub shall give the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the

 



13  Schedule TO before it is filed with the SEC. In addition, Parent and Merger
Sub agree to provide the Company and its counsel (i) in writing with any
comments, whether written or oral, Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, and any written or oral
responses thereto, and (ii) reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
any written or oral response to such comments or any proposed amendment to the
Offer Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.

(f) If, between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any
particular Company Share is accepted for payment and paid for pursuant to the
Offer, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares by means of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or
similar transaction, then the Per Share Amount applicable to such Company
Share shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.2  _Company Action_.

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company hereby consents to and
approves the Offer. Subject to _Section 6.10_, the Company hereby further
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of such approval and of the
recommendation of the Company Board described in _Section 4.4(b)_. The
Company shall not withdraw or modify such recommendation in any manner
adverse to Merger Sub or Parent except as provided in _Section 6.10_.

 

(b) Concurrently with the filing of the Schedule TO by Merger Sub and
conditioned on Parents and Merger Subs having fulfilled their obligation to
provide information to Company on a timely basis as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2(b)_, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing,
except as provided in _Section 6.10_, the recommendation of the Company Board
described in _Section 4.4(b)_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated in all material
respects as required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of federal securities
laws. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree to correct promptly any
information provided by any of them for use in the Schedule 14D-9 which shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Company
Shares, in each case in all material respects as required by
applicable federal securities laws. Parent or Merger Sub shall as promptly as
practicable furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Merger Sub that is required by applicable federal securities laws or
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with its obligations
relating to the Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall give Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule
14D-9 (including any amendments thereto) before it is filed with the SEC. In
addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent, Merger and their counsel (i)
in writing with any comments, whether written or oral, the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time 

 



14  from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
the receipt of such comments, and (ii) reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any written or oral response to such comments or any proposed
amendment to the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall as promptly as
practicable furnish or cause to be furnished (including by instructing its
transfer agent to promptly furnish) to Merger Sub mailing labels containing
the names and addresses of all record holders of Company Shares and with
security position listings of Company Shares held in stock depositories, each
as of a recent date, together with all other available listings and computer
files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record
holders and beneficial owners of Company Shares. The Company shall promptly
furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger Sub such additional information,
including updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing
labels and security position listings, and such other assistance in
disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of Company Shares as Parent or
Merger Sub may reasonably request. Subject to the requirements of Law,
including applicable stock exchange rules, and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary
to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in
confidence the information contained in such labels, listings and files and
shall use such information only in connection with the Transactions.

Section 2.3 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ ") to purchase up to that number of Company Shares (the " _Top-Up
Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Company Shares that, when
added to the number of Company Shares collectively owned by Parent or Merger
Sub at the time of exercise, shall constitute one Company Share more than
ninety percent (90%) of the Company Shares then outstanding (determined on a
fully diluted basis after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares), at a purchase price per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Per Share
Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 2.3(a)_,
the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable if (i) the Minimum Condition shall
have not been met or (ii) the aggregate number of (A) Company Shares issuable
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, plus (B) Company Shares then outstanding,
plus (C) Company Shares issuable upon exercise of all options and other rights
to purchase Company Shares, would exceed the number of authorized Company
Shares.

(b) Merger Sub may, at its election, exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole,
but not in part, at any one time after Merger Subs acceptance for payment of
Company Shares pursuant to the Offer and prior to the earlier of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement.

 

(c) If Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall send
to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") specifying
the place for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the "
_Top-Up Closing_ ") and a date not earlier than one (1) Business Day nor later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date of the Top-Up Exercise Notice for
the Top-Up Closing. The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up
Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to Parent or Merger Sub confirming
(i) the number of Company Shares then outstanding on a fully diluted basis,
and (ii) the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price
therefor.

 



15 (d) At the Top-Up Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement: (i) the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub a certificate or
certificates evidencing the applicable number of Top-Up Option Shares;
_provided, however_ , that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up
Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the
conditions that (A) no provision of any applicable Law shall prohibit the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in
respect of any such exercise and (B) the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable if the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares would result in the
issuance of Company Shares equal to or greater than 19.9% of the Company
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Execution Date
unless Parent and Merger Sub certify to the Company in writing that within
three (3) Business Days following the exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent
and Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger in a short-form merger without a
meeting of the Company shareholders in accordance with Section 253 of the
DGCL (in which case, the Top-Up Option may be exercised without regard to this
subsection B); and (ii) Merger Sub shall purchase each Top-Up Option Share
from the Company at the Per Share Amount. Payment by Merger Sub of the
purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares may be made by delivery of
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by the
Company, a six-month full recourse promissory note bearing interest at the
six-month LIBOR rate then in effect, or any combination of such wire transfer
funds and promissory note. The Parties shall cooperate to ensure that the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with
all applicable legal requirements, including all federal securities laws.

(e) Upon the delivery by Merger Sub to the Company of the Top-Up Exercise
Notice, and the tender of the consideration described in _Section 2.3(d)_,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Merger Sub to be
the holder of record of the Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon that exercise,
notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company may then be
closed or that certificates representing those Top-Up Option Shares may not
then be actually delivered to Merger Sub or the Company may have failed or
refused to designate the account described in _Section 2.3(d)_.

(f) Certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares delivered hereunder shall
include legends legally required by applicable securities laws.

Section 2.4 _Board of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f)_.

(a) Promptly upon the purchase by Merger Sub of Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer and from time to time thereafter, and subject to the last sentence of
this _Section 2.4(a)_, Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such
number of directors, rounded to the nearest whole number, constituting at
least a majority of the directors, on the Company Board as will give Parent
representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the number of
directors on the Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of
directors pursuant to this  _Section 2.4_) and the percentage that the
number of Company Shares beneficially owned by Parent and Merger Sub bears to
the total number of outstanding Company Shares, and the Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to, upon request by Parent, promptly, at the Companys

 



16  election, either increase the size of the Company Board or secure the
resignation of such number of directors as is necessary to enable Parents
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board and to cause
Parents designees to be so elected or appointed. At such times, the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause persons designated by Parent to
constitute a majority of each (i) committee of the Company Board, other than
any committee of the Company Board, if any, established to take action under
this Agreement, (ii) Board of Directors of each Subsidiary of the Company, and
(iii) each committee thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that three of the members of the
Company Board as of the date hereof shall remain members of the Company Board
until the Effective Time. If the number of directors who are members of the
Company Board as of the date hereof is reduced below three prior to the
Effective Time, the remaining directors who are members of the Company Board
as of the date hereof or their designees (or if there is only one such
director, that remaining director) shall be entitled to designate a person
(or persons) to fill such vacancy (or vacancies).

(b) The Companys obligation to appoint designees to the Company Board shall
be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder. Subject to the Parents compliance with the final sentence of this
Section 2.4(b), the Company shall promptly take all actions, including filing
an amendment to the Schedule 14D-9 (and disseminating such amendment to the
stockholders of the Company to the extent required by applicable Laws)
containing such information with respect to the Company and its officers and
directors and Parents designees as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require, in
order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.4_. Parent shall
timely supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any
information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder.

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
this _Section 2.4_ and prior to the Effective Time, if there shall be any
directors of the Company who were directors as of the date hereof, any
amendment of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement by the Company,
any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub or waiver of any of the
Companys rights hereunder or other action adversely affecting the rights of
stockholders of the Company (other than Parent or Merger Sub), will require
the concurrence of a majority of such directors.

 



17 Section 2.5 _Short Form Merger_. If, after the consummation of the Offer and
any exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Company Shares beneficially
owned by Parent, Merger Sub and Parents other Subsidiaries collectively
represent at least ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding Company
Shares, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and the Company shall, execute and
deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as Parent
or Merger Sub may request, in order to cause the Merger to be completed as
promptly as reasonably practicable as provided in Section 253 of the DGCL,
and otherwise as provided in _Article III_ below.

ARTICLE III 

THE MERGER

Section 3.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof,
and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
and shall continue its corporate existence under the DGCL.

Section 3.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") and all actions specified
in this Agreement to occur at the Closing shall take place at the offices of
Wyrick Robbins Yates and Ponton LLP, 4101 Lake Boone Trail, Suite 300, Raleigh,
North Carolina 27607, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the second Business Day
following the day on which the last of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ shall have been fulfilled or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature are satisfied at Closing, but subject to the waiver of
fulfillment of those conditions) or at such other time and place as Parent and
the Company shall agree (the " _Closing Date_ "). On the Closing Date and
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Ownership and Merger
in the case of a short-form merger or a Certificate of Merger in the case of a
long-form merger, in substantially the respective forms attached hereto as
_Exhibits C_ and D (each being a " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (or at such subsequent time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger),
such time being referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_."

Section 3.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL, this
Agreement and the Certificate of Merger. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and subject thereto, as of the Effective Time, all properties,
rights, immunities, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



18 Section 3.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

 

(a) At and following the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation of the Company attached to the Certificate of Merger filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter duly amended.

(b) At and following the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter duly amended. 

Section 3.5 _Directors; Officers_.

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be.

 

Section 3.6 _Manner and Basis of Converting Capital Stock_. As of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any securities of the Merging
Corporations:

(a) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation outstanding immediately after the Effective Time.
Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares
shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and all shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or the Company (including any shares of Company Common
Stock issued by the Company pursuant to the Top-Up Option) immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Company Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with _Section 3.6(b)_ and other than Dissenting
Shares, as hereinafter defined) shall be converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without any interest
thereon, equal to the Per Share Amount (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), less
any required withholding taxes, upon surrender and exchange of a Certificate.
As of the Effective Time, all such Company Shares, when so converted, shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
Company Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided herein.

 



19 Section 3.7 _Treatment of Company Options and Restricted Company Shares_. 

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to each holder of a Company Option that is Vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such option, or portion thereof,
a " _Company Vested Option_ "), an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to
the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the per
share exercise price of the Company Vested Option held by such holder and (B)
the number of shares of common stock subject thereto (the " _Option
Consideration_ ") (such payment, if any, to be net of applicable Taxes).
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay such amounts
under this _Section 3.7(a)_ to the holder of each such Company Vested Option
within ten (10) Business Days following receipt by Parent of all reasonably
necessary forms of transmittal information from such holder. Parent shall
provide the Company within five (5) Business Days following the date hereof
forms of all transmittal information (including any Tax forms
or certifications) reasonably necessary in respect to the payment of the
Option Consideration. In connection therewith, the Company shall disseminate
such transmittal information, provide any other notices to holders of vested
Company Options, and the Company Board shall adopt any resolutions, in each
case as reasonably requested by Parent.

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume any Company
Option, or portion of such Company Option, that is not Vested immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each an " _Assumed Option_ "), and each such
Assumed Option shall become an option to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Assumed Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent common stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) determined by multiplying (i) the number of Shares
subject to the unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (ii) the quotient obtained from dividing the Per Share Amount by the
Average Price (the " _Option Exchange Ratio_ ") (rounded down to the nearest
whole number), at a price per share of Parent common stock (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained from dividing (A) the
exercise price per share of the shares of Company Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to the assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio. In connection therewith, the Company
shall provide any notices to holders of Assumed Options and the Company Board
shall adopt any resolutions, in each case as reasonably requested by Parent,
to effectuate the foregoing.

(c) Except as otherwise separately agreed in writing between Parent and any
holder of an award of Company restricted stock units, each award of Company
restricted stock units (each a " _Company RSU_ ") outstanding at the Effective
Time that is to be settled in Company Common Stock and is outstanding and not
Vested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent
(each an " _Assumed RSU_ ") and converted into a restricted stock unit,
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company
RSU, to acquire that number of shares of Parent common stock equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Company RSU, and (y) the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest share of Parent.

 



20 (d) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent common stock for delivery upon exercise
of the Assumed Options and conversion and settlement of the Assumed RSUs. As
soon as practicable (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days after
the Effective Time), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor form) or another appropriate form with respect to the shares
of Parent common stock subject to such Assumed Options and Assumed RSUs, and
thereafter shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of that registration statement for as long as any Assumed
Options or Assumed RSUs remain outstanding.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, any Tax deductions
arising from any change-in-control, bonus or similar payments, or the
cancellation and termination of Company Options and payment of Option
Consideration arising from or pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (i) shall be treated as arising on the day of, but arising and
properly allocable to the portion of the day after, the Effective Time and
(ii) shall be treated as arising in, and shall be allocated to, the Companys
taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the day of the Effective
Time (the " _Post-Closing Period_ "). The parties shall report consistently
with the preceding sentence for all Tax purposes, and shall not take any
inconsistent position in any Tax proceeding. In making such allocation, the
parties agree that the cancellation and termination of the Company Vested
Options and payment of the Option Consideration pursuant to this Agreement,
arises outside the ordinary course of business of the Company as carried on
prior to the day of the Effective Time and therefore is appropriately
allocated to the Post-Closing Period. 

Section 3.8 _Treatment of Company Warrants_. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that, effective as of the Effective Time,
the Company Warrants are terminated. In consideration of such termination,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (a) pay to the holder
of each Company Warrant, an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price of the Company Warrant held by such holder and (ii) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (the " _Warrant
Consideration_ ") (such payment, if any, to be net of applicable withholding
taxes). Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay such
amounts under this _Section 3.8_ as soon as practicable following (but in no
event more than three (3) Business Days after) the Effective Time to the
holder of the Company Warrant.

Section 3.9 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who
shall have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, unless and until the
applicable holder fails to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such holders rights to
receive payment of the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares under
Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails
to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares

 



21  shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section 3.9_, if this Agreement
is terminated prior to the Effective Time, then the right of any holder of
Company Shares to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. The Company shall give
Parent notice of any written demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares
received by the Company under Section 262 of the DGCL, and shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in negotiations and Proceedings with respect
to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, (i) make any payment with respect to any such demands for
appraisal, (ii) offer to settle or settle any such demands, (iii) waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance with
the DGCL or (iv) agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.10 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall
appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as exchange and paying agent, registrar and transfer agent (the
" _Paying Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Company Shares for the Merger
Consideration, and (ii) Parent shall deposit, or Parent shall otherwise take
all steps necessary to cause to be deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent
for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, cash in an aggregate amount
equal to the product of (x) the number of Company Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6(c)_ and (y) the
Merger Consideration (such aggregate amount being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Payment Fund_ "). For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of
cash to be deposited by Parent pursuant to this _Section 3.10(a)_, Parent
shall assume that no holder of Company Shares will perfect their right to
appraisal of their Company Shares under the DGCL. Following the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall retain the right to invest and reinvest the
Payment Fund on behalf of the Surviving Corporation in securities listed or
guaranteed by the United States government or certificates of deposit of
commercial banks that have, or are members of a group of commercial banks
that has, consolidated total assets of not less than $500,000,000 and the
Surviving Corporation shall receive the interest earned thereon.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event
more than three (3) Business Days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of a Certificate or
Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company
Shares (i) a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a form letter of
transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, which shall be in a form and contain
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may determine necessary, and
(iii) instructions for use in surrendering such Certificates and receiving the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof to which such holder is entitled
under this Agreement. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in the case of Company Shares,
cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate and (ii) the Merger Consideration, to
be mailed within ten (10)

 



22  Business Days of receipt of such Certificate. No interest or dividends will
be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration. If the Merger Consideration is
to be delivered in the name of a person other than the person in whose name
the Certificate surrendered is registered in the stock transfer records of the
Company, it shall be a condition of such delivery that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of such delivery to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate, or that such person shall establish
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 3.10(b)_, each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares or Company Shares to be canceled
pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_) shall represent, for all purposes, only the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of Company Shares formerly evidenced by such
Certificate without any interest or dividends thereon. The Payment Fund shall
be used as provided herein and shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The consideration issued upon the
surrender of Certificates in accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Shares formerly represented thereby. After the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of any shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

(d) _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any
amounts that may be payable to the former stockholders of the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement) which remains unclaimed by the
former stockholders of the Company upon the first anniversary of the Effective
Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any
former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall, subject to _Section 3.10(e)_, thereafter look only to
the Parent and the Surviving Corporation only as general unsecured creditors
thereof for payment of any Merger Consideration, without any interest or
dividends thereon, that may be payable in respect of each Company Share held
by such stockholders. None of Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to a holder of Certificates or any other person in respect of
any cash or other consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if requested by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Certificate, Parent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.6_.

 



23 (f) _Withholding Taxes_. The right of any Person to receive payment or
consideration payable upon surrender of a Certificate pursuant to the Merger
will be subject to any applicable requirements with respect to the withholding
of any Tax. To the extent amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, (i) such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Shares, in respect of which the deduction, withholding and remittance
to the appropriate Governmental Entity was made and (ii) Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
to, promptly pay over such withheld amounts to the appropriate Governmental
Entity. This _Section 3.10(f)_ shall also apply, mutatis mutandis, to any
amounts payable pursuant to _Section 3.7_.

(g) _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
issued and outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, redenomination,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration and any other dependent items shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and as
so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration or other dependent item, subject to further adjustment in
accordance with this sentence.

Section 3.11 _Further Assurances_. If at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary,
desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise,
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either
of the Merging Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, the Company or Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and
their respective proper officers and directors or their designees shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the
Merging Corporations, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of either Merging Corporation
or any such Stockholder, all such other acts and things as may be necessary,
desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporations
right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges,
powers, franchises, properties or assets of such Merging Corporation and
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

Except as set forth in the applicable section of the schedule of exceptions
delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub simultaneously with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (the " _Company Schedule of
Exceptions_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any information in a
particular section or subsection of the Company Schedule of Exceptions shall
be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection of
the Agreement to which the relevance of such information is reasonably
apparent on its face), and except as 

 



24  disclosed in the Companys reports, schedules, forms and registration
statements filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder through
the date of this Agreement (other than forward-looking disclosures in the
"Risk Factors" section of such filings and any other disclosures included in
such filings that are forward-looking in nature) (collectively, the " _SEC
Reports_ "), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Organization, Power and Standing_.

in such jurisdiction) under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization, and each has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably
be expected to have, when aggregated with all other such failures, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The copies of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the
" _Company Certificate_ "), and Bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), filed with
the Companys SEC Reports are complete and correct copies of such documents,
and no other such documents are binding upon the Company. The Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws are in full force and effect. The Company
is not in violation of any provision of the Company Certificate or the
Company Bylaws that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries has heretofore furnished to Parent a
complete and correct copy of its Articles of Incorporation, Certificate of
Incorporation, Articles of Organization or Articles of Association, as the
case may be, (collectively, the " _Subsidiary Charters_ ") and its Bylaws or
Memorandum of Association, as the case may be (collectively, the " _Subsidiary
Bylaws_ "), each as amended to date. The Subsidiary Charters and the
Subsidiary Bylaws are in full force and effect. The Companys Subsidiaries
are not in violation of any provision of the applicable Subsidiary Charters or
the Subsidiary Bylaws that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) The Company has made available to Parent and its representatives correct
and complete copies of the minutes (or, in the case of minutes that have not
yet been finalized, drafts thereof) of all meetings of stockholders, the
Company Board and each committee of the Company Board and each of its
Subsidiaries held since January 1, 2011.

 

Section 4.2 _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of (i) Forty Million (40,000,000) shares of Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share and (ii) Five Million (5,000,000) shares of Preferred Stock,
par value $0.001 per share (" _Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of January 11,
2012, there were 18,591,609 shares of Company Shares issued and outstanding
and no shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, other than
any Company Shares issued after the date hereof pursuant to Company Options

2012, there were outstanding Company Options to acquire 2,363,803 Company
Shares and outstanding Company RSUs to acquire 461,468 Company Shares. As of
the date of this Agreement, the only outstanding warrants to purchase Company
Shares are the Company Warrants. _Section 4.2_ of the Company Schedule of
Exceptions sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a complete and
accurate list of the Company Options and Company RSUs, the Company Stock Plan
under which each Company Option and Company RSU was awarded, the number of
shares issuable thereunder, vesting schedule, exercise price, if any, and

Company Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. As of the date of this
Agreement, except as provided by this Agreement and except for the Company
Options, Company RSUs and Company Warrants, there are no subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, stock appreciation rights or other commitments,
rights or agreements of any character relating to dividend rights or the
purchase, sale (other than registration rights), issuance or voting of any
security of the Company to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
is a party, including any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or
representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive, any Company Shares.
There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries which provide by their terms a right to vote on
matters submitted to stockholders of the Company. There are no voting trusts
or other agreements or understandings to which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the shares or other
equity interests of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries.

Section 4.3 _Subsidiaries_. _Section 4.3_ of the Company Schedule
of Exceptions sets forth a complete and correct list of each Subsidiary of
the Company, as well as the jurisdiction of organization or association and
the ownership of outstanding equity interests of each such Subsidiary. The
Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, all of its
Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Liens, and all
equity interests of the Companys Subsidiaries held by the Company have been
duly and validly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar
rights, purchase option, call or right of first refusal or similar rights.
All such equity interests are free and clear of any Liens, other than
Permitted Liens, or any other limitations or restrictions on such equity
interests (including any limitation or restriction on the right to vote,
pledge or sell or otherwise dispose of such equity interests). There are no
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, stock appreciation rights
or other commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase,
sale, issuance or voting by any Person other than the Company of any security
of any Subsidiary of the Company, including any securities convertible into,
exchangeable for or representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive
any security of any Subsidiary of the Company. Except for the capital stock
of, or other equity or voting interests in, its Subsidiaries, the Company does
not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of (or other ownership
interest in) or any other securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for capital stock of (or ownership interest in) any Person
other than the Company Subsidiaries.

 



26 Section 4.4 _Authority_.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions contemplated
hereby, subject to (if the Merger is not consummated pursuant to Section 253

Subsidiaries have good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased
properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in all of their tangible
properties and assets, real and personal, used or held for use in their
businesses located on their premises or shown on the consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date or
acquired thereafter, free and clear of any Liens, except for (i) Liens for
taxes not yet delinquent or the amount or validity of which is being contested
in good faith, and (ii) Liens which do not, individually or in the aggregate,
materially interfere with or materially impair the conduct of the business of
the Company or any

 



31  Subsidiary as presently conducted. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
owns any real property. The Companys and each Subsidiarys buildings,
equipment and other tangible assets are in good operating condition (normal
wear and tear excepted) and are fit for use in the ordinary course of their
businesses, except for any failure to be in such condition that could not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. _Section
4.9_ of the Company Schedule of Exceptions sets forth all of the licenses,
leases and subleases for the use or occupancy of the leased real property used
or held for use in the business operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Leases_ "). The Company has not, and
to the Companys Knowledge no other party thereto has, cancelled, modified,
assigned, extended or amended the Leases except as set forth on  _Section
4.9_ of the Company Schedule of Exceptions, and the Leases are valid and
effective in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not under
any of the Leases, any existing default or event of default by the Company or
the Subsidiaries (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default), except where the lack of such validity and
effectiveness or the existence of such default or event of default would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have previously furnished true, correct and complete
copies of the Leases to Parent, including any and all amendments thereto.
There are no leasing commissions or similar payments due, arising out of,
resulting from or with respect to any Lease which are owed by Company or its
Subsidiaries. Except as otherwise set forth in the Leases, the Company or its
Subsidiaries have not granted any oral or written right or interest in or to
the leased real property to any other person to lease, sublease, license or
otherwise use or occupy the leased real property. The Company has peaceful and
undisturbed possession of the leased real property under the Leases. Each
parcel of leased real property is located on public roads or streets or, to
the Companys Knowledge, has a right of access without trespass to the same.
To the Companys Knowledge, all utility systems required in connection with
the use, occupancy and operation of each leased real property space is
sufficient for their present purposes and are operational and there are no
known material structural, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, air conditioning,
heating or other defects in the leased real property. Neither the Company nor
its Subsidiaries have received notice of any non-compliance with current
zoning or land use laws affecting any leased real property or any portion
thereof, and, to the Companys Knowledge, no such action is presently
threatened. To the Companys Knowledge (A) there is no pending condemnation or
similar proceeding affecting the leased real property or any portion thereof
and (B) no such action is presently contemplated or threatened against any
leased real property. To the Companys Knowledge, no material federal, state
or municipal law, ordinance, regulation or restriction is violated by the
continued maintenance, operation, use or occupancy of any leased real property
in its present manner, except for such violations which would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and, to the Companys
Knowledge, the current use of the leased real property does not violate in any
material respect any restrictive covenants affecting such leased real
property. To the Companys Knowledge there is no law, ordinance, order,
regulation or requirement now in existence which is reasonably likely to
require any material expenditure to modify or improve any of the leased real
property in order to bring it into compliance therewith.

Section 4.10  _Permits and Compliance with Laws_. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in

32  a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and the Subsidiaries each

variances, exemptions, orders and approvals (collectively, " _Permits_ ") of

the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.22 _Substantial Customers_.

(a) _Section 4.22(a)_ of the Company Schedule of Exceptions lists the fifteen
(15) largest customers of the Company (based on revenues for the 12-month
period ending on the December 31, 2011), with the name of each such customer
redacted, but the revenue for such 12-month period specified.

since the beginning of such 12-month period, (ii) to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened to cease or materially reduce such purchases or (iii) to

extent they have previously expired, or otherwise terminated, in accordance
with their terms. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated
any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which, with or

holders of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to the
Companys stockholders from a financial point of view (the " _Fairness
Opinion_ ").

banker or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders or other similar
fee or commission in connection with any of the Transactions contemplated by

Section 4.25 _Section 203; No Stockholder Rights Plan_. The Company and the
Company Board have taken all appropriate actions so that, assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.11_,
the restrictions on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL
will not apply with respect to or as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger. As of the date hereof, the Company does

to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets

the Company a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of each of

with, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to
others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or require any payment under, or give rise to a loss of any benefit to which
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent is entitled under any provision of any
contract applicable to any of them or their respective properties or assets or
(iv) result in the creation or imposition of a Lien on any asset of Parent or
any of its subsidiaries, except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv)
of this _Section 5.4(a)_, to the extent that any such conflict, violation,
breach, default, right, loss or Lien would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery by each of Merger Sub and Parent of this
Agreement does not, and the performance of this Agreement and the
consummation by each of Merger Sub and Parent of the Transactions will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Entity, except for: (i) applicable

thereunder, and filing and recordation of appropriate documents for
the Merger as required by the DGCL; and (ii) such other consents, orders,

or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity, that, individually or

Effect.

payments under this Agreement.

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the fully
executed commitment letter and the related fee letter (with only the fee

parties thereto. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter has not been
amended or modified in any respect, and the respective commitments
contained therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in
any respect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a material default or
material breach under the Commitment Letter, and Parent has no reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis, any term or
condition of closing to be satisfied by it, contained in the Commitment
Letter. There are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount
of the Financing other than the conditions precedent set forth in the
Commitment Letter, and Parent has no reason to believe that it will not be
able to satisfy any term or condition of closing of the Financing that is
required to be satisfied as a condition of the Financing, or that the
Financing will not be made

 



49  available to Parent on the Closing Date. There are no other agreements, side

fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letter to be paid by it on or

and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, and
activities related thereto, including acquisition of the capital stock of the
Company. Merger Sub does not have any Subsidiaries. 

Section 5.9 _Offer Documents; Proxy Statement; Schedule 14D-9_. The Offer
Documents shall not, at the time the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC
or are first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, as the
case may be, and at the Acceptance Time contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated

communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Company
Stockholders Meeting which shall have become false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no representation or
warranty with respect to any information supplied by the Company or any of
its representatives for inclusion in any of the foregoing documents or the
Offer Documents. The Offer Documents shall comply in all material respects as
to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. 

Section 5.10 _Vote Required_. No vote of the holders of any of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement and

take any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or order provided that such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on the Company
in the event the Closing occurs. 

Section 6.4 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding the
Transactions shall be a joint press release with respect to the execution of
this Agreement and thereafter. Prior to the Closing, the Parties will not
issue any press release with respect to the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise issue any written public statements with respect to
such Transactions without the prior written consent of the other party, except
as may be required by applicable law or regulation, in which case the party
making such disclosure will first provide to the other party the text of the
proposed disclosure, the reasons such disclosure is required and the time and
manner in which the disclosure is intended to be made.

Section 6.5 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of Effective Time and the date this Agreement is properly terminated
in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company will, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries and its and their affiliates, and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financial advisors and representatives (collectively, the " _Company
Representatives_ ") to, give Merger Sub and Parent and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financial advisors, representatives, consultants and financing

 



56  sources (collectively, the " _Parent Representatives_ ") access, upon
reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to the offices and other
facilities and to the books and records and personnel of the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries and will cause its Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives to furnish Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent Representatives
with such financial and operating data and such other information with
respect to the business and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries as
Parent, Merger Sub or the Parent Representatives may from time to time
reasonably request. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required to provide access to, or disclose, information to the extent such
access or disclosure would jeopardize or violate any attorney-client privilege
or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (it being agreed
that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy
or contravention). The Company makes no representation or warranty as to the
accuracy of any information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.5_, and
neither Merger Sub nor Parent may rely on the accuracy of any such
information, in each case other than as expressly set forth in the Companys
representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_. The information
provided pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ will be used solely for the purpose
of effecting the Transactions and each of Parent and Merger Sub will, and
will cause the Parent Representatives to, treat any such information in
accordance with the terms and conditions of that certain Mutual Nondisclosure
Agreement dated November 7, 2011 between the Company and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and those certain Letter Agreements, dated
December 22, 2011, December 23, 2011, December 27, 2011 and December 30, 2011,
between the Company and Parent (collectively, the " _Diligence Agreements_
").

Section 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to give notice as promptly as practicable to the
Company, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to give notice
as promptly as practicable to Parent, of: (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence
of any event or circumstance, of which the Parent or Company (as applicable)
is aware, and which causes (i) the representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement and made by it to fail to be true and correct in all material
respects or (ii) the covenants, conditions or agreements contained in this
Agreement and made by it not to be complied with or satisfied in all material
respects; (b) any failure of any of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company, as the
case may be, to comply in all material respects in a timely manner with or
satisfy its respective covenants, conditions or agreements to be complied with
or satisfied by it hereunder; (c) in the case of the Company, a Company
Material Adverse Effect; and (d) in the case of the Parent, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, (A)
the failure of any Party to provide a notice required under this _Section
6.6_ shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the obligations of any
Party in this Agreement or Annex A nor shall such failure affect the right of
any Party to terminate in accordance with Article VIII, unless in any case the
event or circumstance relates to a Company Material Adverse Effect (in the
case of the Company) or a Parent Material Adverse Effect (in the case of
Parent) and (B) the notice obligations under this Section 6.6 shall not modify
or reduce the representations, warranties or covenants of any Party or the
conditions to the obligations of any Party hereunder, nor shall it limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such
notice.

 



57 Section 6.7 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) The certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and director exculpation, as are set forth in the
Company Certificate and Company Bylaws as in effect at the date hereof (to the
extent consistent with applicable Law), which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the persons who at any time prior to the Effective Time were
entitled to indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation under the
Company Certificate and Company Bylaws in respect of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
the Transactions), unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(b) From and after the Effective Time and until the expiration of any
applicable statutes of limitation, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the present and former officers, directors, employees
and agents of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), liabilities or amounts that are paid
in settlement of, or otherwise (" _Losses_ "), in connection with any claim,
action, suit, Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative and including all appeals thereof (a " _Claim_
") to which any Indemnified Party is or may become a party to by virtue of his
or her service as a present or former director, officer, fiduciary or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or his or her serving at
the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, and arising out of actual or alleged
events, actions or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior
to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, matters related to the
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement or consummation of
the Transactions), in each case to the fullest extent permitted and provided
in the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws as in effect at the date hereof
and as permitted under the DGCL.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall obtain "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance in an amount and scope
no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company for claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time at a
cost that is reasonable and customary for tail insurance policies with its
existing directors and officers liability policy insurer or an insurer with
a comparable insurer financial strength rating as the Companys existing
directors and officers liability policy insurer; or (ii) if the Company
shall not have obtained such tail policy, the Surviving Corporation will
provide for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time
the directors and officers who are insured under the Companys directors and
officers insurance policy with an insurance policy that provides coverage for
events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_")
that is not less favorable taken as a whole than the existing policy of the
Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium for the DandO Insurance in
excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
insurance; _provided further, however_ , that if the annual premium of such

 



58  coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain competitive quotes (from insurance
providers with comparable ratings) for such insurance coverage in an effort to
reduce the cost thereof.

 

(d) The obligations under this _Section 6.7_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to affect adversely any Indemnified Party to
whom this _Section 6.7_ applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this _Section 6.7_ applies and their respective heirs, successors and
assigns shall be express third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.7_).
This _Section 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
the Indemnified Parties referred to herein, their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
successors and assigns.

(e) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

Section 6.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Company Benefit Plans in effect as of
the date of this Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to employees
of the Company (or their Subsidiaries) covered by such plans at the Effective
Time until such time as Parent shall, subject to applicable Law, the terms of
this Agreement and the terms of such plans, adopt new benefit plans with
respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _New Benefit
Plans_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate
in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing Company Benefit Plans with a view
towards developing appropriate New Benefit Plans for the employees covered
thereby. At such time as any New Benefit Plans are implemented, Parent will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries to, with respect to all New Benefit Plans,
(i) provide each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries with service or
other credit for all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries under any New
Benefit Plan that is a welfare plan that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time, to the extent that such employee
would receive credit for such conditions under the corresponding welfare plan
in which any such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) provide each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Benefit Plan that is a
welfare plan that such employees are eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time, (iii) provide each employee with credit for all service for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals (but not for benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) with the Company and its
Subsidiaries, under each employee benefit plan, program, or arrangement of
Parent or its Subsidiaries in which such employees are eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, and (iv)

 



59  provide benefits under medical, dental, vision and similar health and
welfare plans that are in the aggregate no less favorable than those provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries; _provided,
however_ , that in no event shall the employees be entitled to any credit to
the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 6.8_, Parent shall have no obligation to provide any credit for
service, co-payments, deductibles paid, or for any purpose, unless and until
Parent has received such supporting documentation as Parent may reasonably
deem to be necessary in order to verify the appropriate credit to be provided.

(b) If requested by Parent at least seven (7) days prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit Plans intended
to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than the last
business day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that
Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated
pursuant to resolution of the Companys Board (the form and substance of
which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the
day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

(c) The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms all benefits accrued
through the Effective Time under Company Benefit Plans or under other
contracts, arrangements, commitments, or understandings described in the
Company Schedule of Exceptions.

 

Section 6.9 _Further Assurances; Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 6.10 _No Solicitation_.

(a) _Company Takeover Proposal_. 

(i) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any Company
Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or permit any Company Representatives
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission
of, any Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect
to, or take any other action to facilitate knowingly the making of any inquiry
or any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) make or authorize any statement,
recommendation or solicitation in respect of any Company Takeover Proposal
(except as permitted by _Section 6.10(b)_).

(ii) The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and
each Company Representative to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all discussions or negotiations with any person conducted
heretofore with respect to

 



60  any proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Takeover Proposal and (B) request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information previously furnished. The Company shall, and
shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, enforce (and not release any person
from any obligations under) any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the Company
may, in response to a Company Takeover Proposal that the Company Board
determines in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and an
independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation is or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Company Proposal that was not
solicited by the Company or Company Representatives and that did not otherwise
result from a breach of this _Section 6.10(a)_, and subject to providing
prior written notice of its decision to take such action to Parent and
compliance with _Section 6.10(c):_ (A) furnish information with respect to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreements not less
restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined
in _Section 6.5_), provided that all such information not previously provided
to Parent is provided or made available on a substantially concurrent basis
to Parent and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person
making such Company Takeover Proposal regarding such Company Takeover
Proposal.

 

(b) _Change in Recommendation_.

(i) Neither the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall
(A) (1) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement,
the Offer or the Merger or (2) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal (either (1) or (2) being a " _Change
in Recommendation_ ") or (B) approve, cause or permit the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or similar agreement (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_
") relating to any Company Takeover Proposal.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, to the extent that the
Company Board determines after consultation with outside counsel that a
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the
Company Board under applicable Laws, (A) make a Change in Recommendation or
(B) at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, in response to a Superior Company Proposal
that was not solicited by or on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and did not otherwise result from a breach of  _Section 6.10(a)_,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ so long as concurrently
with or immediately after such termination, the Company Board causes the
Company to accept such Superior Company Proposal and enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto; _provided, however_ , that such
determination shall not be made prior to the fifth Business Day following
receipt by Parent of a Superior Proposal Notice. A " _Superior
Proposal Notice_ " means a written notice to Parent from the Company advising
Parent that the Company Board is prepared to make a Change in Recommendation
or accept a Superior Company Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of
such Superior Company Proposal and identifying the person making such
Superior Company

 



61  Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the
price or any other material term of such Superior Company Proposal shall
require a new Superior Proposal Notice and a new five (5) Business Day
period, as provided above). During the three (3) Business Day period following
receipt of the Superior Company Proposal (the " _Negotiation Period_ "), the
Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent to make such revisions to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board
not to make a Change in Recommendation or accept a Superior Company Proposal;
provided that, in the event the Person making a Superior Company Proposal
revises such Superior Company Proposal in response to revisions proposed by
Parent, the Company shall notify and provide a copy to Parent of such revised
Superior Company Proposal within 24 hours of receipt thereof and the
Parent and Company shall enter into a Negotiation Period during the two (2)
Business Day period following delivery of such revised Superior Company
Proposal to Parent. If Parent proposes no such revisions during such period as
would permit the Company Board not to make a Change in Recommendation, then
the Company and the Company Board may take such actions described in (A) and
(B) above if after consultation with the Companys financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
that the third partys proposal remains a Superior Company Proposal (even in
light of any of Parents revised proposals) and that, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, the failure to make a Change in Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

(c)  _Company Takeover Proposal Information_. The Company shall promptly, but
in any event within forty-eight (48) hours, advise Parent orally and in
writing of any Company Takeover Proposal (including any change to the terms of
any such Company Takeover Proposal) and the identity of the person making any
such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent fully
informed of the status of any such Company Takeover Proposal, and (ii)
promptly advise Parent of any material amendments to the terms of any such
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not take any actions whether
contractually or otherwise to limit its ability to comply with its obligations
hereunder; provided, that the failure to take any such action would not be
inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board.

Section 6.11  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
duly adopt a resolution that the disposition by any officer or director of the
Company who is a covered Person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder of Shares, Company
Options, Company RSUs pursuant to this Agreement, and the Offer and the Merger
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange
Act.

Section 6.12 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Expiration Date, the
Company (acting through the compensation committee of the Company Board) shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement and arrangement
entered into by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company on or after the
date hereof with any of its officers, directors or employees pursuant to which
consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee to be approved as
an "employment, compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the
Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

 



62 Section 6.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms:

(a) Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to, undertake
any business or activities other than in connection with this Agreement and
engaging in the Merger and the other Transactions.

(b) Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall not engage in any action or enter into
any transaction or permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered
into that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the consummation
of, or otherwise adversely affect, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, acquire (whether via merger,
consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise), or agree to so acquire,
any material amounts of assets of or any equity in any Person or any business
or division thereof, unless that acquisition or agreement would not (i) impose
any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any
authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the Merger or the other
Transactions or the expiration or termination of any waiting period under
applicable Law, or (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering
an order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, or the other
Transactions or increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order
on appeal or otherwise.

Section 6.14 _Rights Agreements_. The Company covenants and agrees that it
will not adopt a stockholder rights plan or "poison pill."

 

Section 6.15 _Fairness Opinion_. As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall deliver a written copy of the Fairness
Opinion to Parent solely for informational purposes.

Section 6.16 _Tax Matters_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the date of the Effective Time, (i) the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by each
such entity during such period (after taking into account any extensions)
(each, a " _Post-Signing Return_ "), which Post-Signing Returns shall be
complete and correct in all respects and, except as otherwise required by Law,
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past practice of the
Company; _provided, however,_ that no material Post-Signing Returns shall be
filed with any Governmental Entity without Parents written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (ii) the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries shall timely pay all Taxes due and payable with
respect to the Tax periods covered by such Post-Signing Returns; (iii) the
Company shall accrue a liability in its books and records and financial
statements in accordance with GAAP and past practice for all Taxes payable by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which no Post-Signing Return is due
prior to the day of the Effective Time; (iv) the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall promptly notify Parent of any suit, claim, action,
investigation, proceeding or audit pending against or with respect to the

 



63  Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any material amount of Tax
and will not settle or compromise any such suit, claim, action, investigation,
proceeding or audit without Parents prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (v) the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries shall retain all books, documents and records necessary for
the preparation of Tax Returns and reports and Tax audits consistent with its
standard policy.

Section 6.17 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 

Section 6.18 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed regarding the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 6.18_ shall
(i) give Parent the right to participate in or control any such defense
or settlement or (ii) require the Company to provide any information or make
any disclosures to Parent that might jeopardize or violate the attorney-client
privilege or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or
agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) if Parent is a party to any such litigation
and such settlement contains any stipulations of fact related to the merits
of the claims against Parent that would reasonably be expected to be adverse
to the Parents defense of such litigation.

 

Section 6.19 _Financing_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, including their reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into,
and keep in effect, definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms
and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter (including the flex
provisions) or on other terms no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub,
provided such terms do not contain any additional conditions to funding and
would not otherwise reasonably be expected to impair or delay the consummation
of the Financing, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub in the Commitment Letter that are within their control,
(iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using
their reasonable best efforts to cause the financing sources to fund the
Financing at or prior to the Closing, (v) to take each of the actions
required of the Company and its Subsidiaries in paragraphs (b)(i) through
(b)(v) below with respect to themselves and their Subsidiaries, and (vi)
enforce their rights under the Commitment Letter (including by taking such
action necessary to cause each other party thereto to specifically perform
their obligations in accordance with the terms thereof). In the event of any
termination of the Commitment Letter or the receipt by Parent of written
notice that the counterparty to the Commitment Letter no longer intends to
provide the Financing, (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company (such
notice being a " _Financing Termination Notice_ ") and (B) Parent and Merger
Sub shall arrange and obtain financing from alternative sources (the "
_Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence
of such event. Parent shall provide the Company regular updates regarding its
progress in obtaining such Alternative Financing and shall deliver to the
Company true and complete copies of all agreements related to such Alternative
Financing (excluding fee letters and engagement letters to the extent Parent
is prohibited from providing 

 



64  such letters) promptly upon the execution thereof. In furtherance of the
provisions of this _Section 6.18_, the Commitment Letter may be amended,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or superseded at the option of
Parent after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by
instruments (the " _New Commitment Letters_ ") that replace the existing
Commitment Letter or contemplate financing from one or more other or
additional parties; provided that the terms of the New Commitment Letters
shall not (1) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set
forth in the existing Commitment Letter, (2) reasonably be expected to,
directly or indirectly, prevent, impede, delay or hinder the Closing or (3)
reduce the aggregate amount of available Financing. In such event, the term
"Commitment Letter" as used herein shall be deemed to include the
Commitment Letter that are not so superseded at the time in question and the
New Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect. Parent shall deliver to
the Company true and complete copies of all agreements related to such New
Commitment Letters (excluding fee letters and engagement letters to the
extent Parent is prohibited from providing such letters) promptly upon the
execution thereof.

(b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to use
their reasonable best efforts to, provide all cooperation in connection with
the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
(provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries),
including (i) making senior management of the Company available to participate
in meetings, due diligence sessions, presentations, "road shows" and sessions
with rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation of customary
materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents required in connection with the Financing, (iii) furnishing Parent
and its financing sources with customary financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the "
_Required Information_ "), including financial statements, pro forma financial
information, financial data, audit reports and other information of the and
form customarily included in such documents, (iv) assisting Parent in
obtaining accountants comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys and title
insurance and (v) executing and delivering any commitment letters,
underwriting or placement agreements, registration statements, pledge and
security documents, other definitive financing documents or other requested
certificates or documents, including a customary solvency certificate by the
Chief Financial Officer of the Company (provided that (A) none of the letters,
agreements, registration statements, documents and certificates shall be
executed, delivered or filed except upon the occurrence of the Closing and
(B) the effectiveness thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become operative
after, the occurrence of the Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
case of each of clauses (i) through (v) above of the prior sentence, (A) none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any other liability or
obligation in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing, and (B) (I)
all non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company or
any of its representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.18_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that
Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information to potential lending
syndicate members during syndication, subject to customary confidentiality
undertakings by such potential syndicate members and (II) the Company shall be
permitted a reasonable period to comment on any documents or other
information circulated to potential financing sources that contain or are
based upon any such non-public or other confidential information. Parent shall
indemnify and 

 



65  hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Companys
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this Section 6.18(b)) and any
information utilized in connection therewith. Parent shall, promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and

its Affiliates and employees have no responsibility for any financing that
Parent may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

respective officers or directors (except for the last sentence of _Section
6.5_ and the entirety of this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and _Article IX_
, which shall survive the termination); _provided_ , _however_ , that

warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement.

 

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in _Section 6.3_ and this _Section 8.3_,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) _Company Termination Fee_. In the event that:

(i) This Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section
8.1(e)_; or

(ii) (A) the Company has knowledge of a Company Takeover Proposal and such
Company Takeover Proposal shall have not been withdrawn, (B) a Company
Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly to holders of Company Common
Stock and such

 



68  Company Takeover Proposal shall have not been withdrawn or (C) any Person
has publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional), and not
withdrawn its intent, to make a Company Takeover Proposal, and thereafter
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, or _Section
8.1(f),_ and within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company either
enters into an Acquisition Agreement or consummates a Company Takeover
Proposal involving the Person who made the Company Takeover Proposal;

then in the case of (i) or (ii) above, the Company shall promptly, but in no
event later than the date of the earliest such event, pay to Parent a fee
equal to (A) Eleven Million Dollars ($11,000,000) plus (B) all reasonable,
documented out-of-pocket Parent expenses relating hereto up to, but not
exceeding, One and a Half Million Dollars ($1,500,000) in the aggregate ((A)
and (B) collectively, the " _Company Termination Fee_ "), payable by wire
transfer of same day funds.

 

(iii) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3(b)_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to make a payment due pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay to Parent and Merger Sub their reasonable costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount set forth in this _Section
8.3(b)_ at the prime rate of Wells Fargo and Company in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in any proceeding by Parent or
Merger Sub alleging breach of the Companys obligations under this Agreement,
the amount of any Company Termination Fee previously paid by Company shall be
credited against any damages that the Parent or Merger Sub may be entitled to
receive.

(iv) In no event shall more than one Company Termination Fee be payable
hereunder.

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_. If this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant
to  _Section 8.1_ (other than subsections _8.1(b)_ , _8.1(d)(i)_ ,
_8.1(d)(ii)_ in respect of Annex A condition (a) and/or (c)(i), (ii), (iii)
and/or (iv), and _8.1(e)_ ) and there then exists any Antitrust Action, any
Antitrust Consent has not been obtained or any Antitrust Order has not been
vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned or (ii) pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(i)_ or _8.1(d)(ii)_ in respect of Annex A condition (c)(i), (ii)
or (iii) on account the existence of any Antitrust Action, the failure to
obtain any Antitrust Consent or the failure to have vacated, lifted, reversed,
or overturned any Antitrust Order, then Parent shall promptly, but in no event
later than two (2) days after the date of such termination, pay to the
Company a fee equal (A) Eleven Million Dollars ($11,000,000) plus (B) all
reasonable, documented out-of-pocket Company expenses relating hereto up to,
but not exceeding, One and a Half Million Dollars ($1,500,000) in the
aggregate ((A) and (B) collectively, the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "),
payable by wire transfer of same day funds. For the avoidance of doubt, any
payment to be made by Parent under this  _Section 8.3(c)_ shall be payable
only once to Company with respect to this _Section 8.3(c)_ and not in
duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof. Provided that Parent and Merger Sub have complied in all
material respects with their obligations under this Agreement and have taken
all actions required to be taken by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
_Section_ ___6.3_ , 

 



69  the Companys receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company (and any of its stockholders, partners,
members, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives or
agents) in connection with this _Section 8.3(c)_ whether at law or equity, in
contract, tort or otherwise. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.3(c)_ are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, Company would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Parent fails promptly to make a payment
due pursuant to this _Section 8.3(c)_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Company commences a suit that results in a judgment against Parent or Merger
Sub, Parent shall pay to Company its reasonable costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount set forth in this _Section 8.3(c)_ at the prime rate
of Wells Fargo and Company in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that in any proceeding by the Company alleging breach of Parents or
Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement, the amount of any Parent
Termination Fee previously paid by Parent shall be credited against any
damages that the Company may be entitled to receive.

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be modified or amended by the
Parties hereto, by or pursuant to action taken by their respective boards of
directors, in the case of Merger Sub or the Company, or Parent, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of the Company, but, after any such approval, no
modification or amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval
by such stockholders without such further approval; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no modification or amendment of this Agreement or of any provision of
this Agreement shall be valid or enforceable unless in writing duly executed
by each of the Parties hereto.

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties
hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other Parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
other Parties representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
other Parties agreements or conditions contained herein which may legally be
waived. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. No failure of any Party to exercise any power given
such Party hereunder or to insist upon strict compliance by any party with its
obligations hereunder, and no custom or practice of the parties in variance
with the terms hereof, shall constitute a waiver of that Partys right to
demand exact compliance with the terms hereof. Any waiver shall not obligate
that Party to agree to any further or subsequent waiver or affect the validity
of the provision relating to any such waiver.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Other Remedies_. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, captions and
headings contained in this Agreement are solely for convenience of reference
and shall not be used to interpret or construe this Agreement. Any references
in this Agreement to "herein," "hereto," "herewith" or "hereunder" shall be to
this Agreement as a whole. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or

71  this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The Parties hereto agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will
be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. Except as
otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the
exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

Section 9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties.

 

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
all exhibits and attachments hereto, including the Company Schedule of
Exceptions, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Diligence Agreements (i)
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,
it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies hereunder, except (A) as specifically provided, following the
Effective Time, in _Sections 3.7_ , _3.8_ , _6.7_ and _ 6.8_ and (B) this
_Section 9.5_ and _Sections 9.10_ , _9.11_ and _9.12_ shall inure to the
benefit of the Debt Financing Sources all of whom are intended to be third-
party beneficiaries thereof (and those Sections shall not be amended or
otherwise modified so as to adversely affect such Debt Financing Sources
without the prior written consent of such Debt Financing Sources).

Section 9.6 _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this
_Section 9.6_ shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The Parties further
agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that (a) each Party shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement

 



72  and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and this
right shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to
cause the Offer and the Merger to be consummated and (b) the parties shall
waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at Law. Each Party further agrees that no Party nor any other person or
entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section 9.8_, and each Party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

unconditionally agrees that any legal action or Proceeding with respect to
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and
the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other
Party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined
exclusively in any court within the State of Delaware. Each of the Parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or Proceeding
for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or Proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt
or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or Proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action
or Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof against the Debt Financing Sources, in any forum
other than the federal and New York State courts located in the City of New
York, Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof).

 

Section 9.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore it hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of
any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and any of the agreements delivered by the Parties in connection
herewith or the

 



73  Transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each Party certifies and

the event of litigation, seek to enforce either of such waivers, (b) it
understands and has considered the implications of such waivers, (c) it makes
such waivers voluntarily, and (d) it has been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in

herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and
any of their respective stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) hereby waives any
rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, any Financing or the Commitment Letter, whether at Law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise and the Company (on behalf of itself, its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective stockholders, partners, members,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives) agrees not to commence any action or proceeding against any
Debt Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger (including any action or proceeding relating to any Financing or the
Commitment Letter) and agrees to cause any such action or proceeding asserted
by the Company (on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives) in connection with this Agreement, the
Offer or the Merger (including any action or proceeding relating to any
Financing or the Commitment Letter) to be dismissed or otherwise terminated.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is
acknowledged and agreed that no Debt Financing Source shall have any
liability for any claims, losses, settlements, liabilities, damages, costs,
expenses, fines or penalties to the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any of
their respective stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives) in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this _Section
9.12_ shall in any way expand or be deemed or construed to expand or limit
the circumstances in which the Parent or Merger Sub may be liable under this
Agreement (including as a result of the Financing).
