Cure Amounts, Buyer shall have sole responsibility for the Assigned Contracts
and all the Assumed Liabilities associated therewith.

         2.5      Consideration.

                  (a)      Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer, not less
than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date, a schedule consistent
with the form of Schedule 2.6(b) used in calculating the Base Net Asset Value
setting forth an estimate of the Net Asset Value as of the close of business on
the day immediately preceding the Closing (the "Preliminary Statement"). The
Base Net Asset Value has been, and the Preliminary Statement shall be, prepared
in a manner consistent with GAAP and in a manner consistent with Seller's
Financial Statements, including, but not limited to, the application of Seller's
historical methodology for establishing reserves for Accounts Receivable, Casino
Liabilities, and any other accounts subject to estimate or judgment, in each
case, to the extent in accordance with GAAP.

                  (b)      (i)      Within fifteen (15) days after the Closing

GAAP.

                           (ii)     Seller or its agents may, at Seller's own

notice to Buyer, to any item on, or other matter relating to the Closing Date
Statement. If Seller does not deliver to Buyer such written notice of objection
within ten (10) days after receipt of the Closing Date Statement, the Closing
Date Statement will be deemed to have been accepted by Seller. If Seller does so
object and if Buyer and Seller are unable, within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by Buyer of such written notice of objection, to resolve any disputes
concerning the Closing Date Statement, the dispute will be turned over to a firm
of independent certified public accountants mutually acceptable to Buyer and
Seller (the "Resolving Accountants"). The Resolving Accountants so selected
shall, as soon as practicable, deliver to Buyer and Seller a written report
resolving any disputed matters and its determination will be conclusive and
binding upon the parties. The expenses of such Resolving Accountants will be
borne by the parties on a pro rata basis in relation to the degree to which the
positions of the respective parties are not confirmed by the accounting firm.

                           (iii)    If the Closing Date Statement reflects a Net
Asset Value less than the Net Asset Value set forth in the Preliminary
Statement, the amount of such shortfall shall be deducted from the Cash Purchase
Price and, within two (2) days following the final confirmation of the Closing
Date Statement, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount in cash equal to the amount
of such shortfall, payable by wire transfer or delivery of other good and
immediately available funds.

                           (iv)     If the Closing Date Statement reflects a Net
Asset Value greater than the Net Asset Value set forth in the Preliminary
Statement, the amount of such excess shall be added to the Cash Purchase Price
and, within two (2) days following the final confirmation of the Closing Date
Statement, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to the amount of
such excess, payable by wire transfer or delivery of other good and immediately
available funds.

         2.8      The Closing.

Date"); provided, however that the Closing Date shall be no later than December
31, 2004, unless such Closing Date is extended by the mutual agreement of the

         All taxes, assessments, charges, and income pertaining to the Acquired
Assets shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of the close of the gaming
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, so that Seller shall bear all
expenses with respect to the Acquired Assets incurred up through and including
the gaming day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and Buyer shall bear all
expenses with respect to the Acquired Assets incurred from and after the close
of such gaming day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Assumed Liabilities shall not
be prorated and shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer.

         In the event that the amount of any prorated item is not known at
Closing, the parties agree that such items shall be prorated at Closing upon the
basis of the best information available, and shall be adjusted when the actual
amount(s) of such items are known, with appropriate charges and credits to be
made. In the event, subsequent to the Closing Date, any adjustment pursuant to
this Section 2.10 shall be necessary, then either party hereto who is entitled
to additional monies shall invoice the other party for such additional amounts
as may be owing, and such amount shall be paid within three (3) days from
receipt of the invoice if such amount is not in dispute. The provisions of this
Section 2.10 shall survive the Closing Date.

                  (b)      Unless and until this Agreement is terminated, except
as Seller may reasonably determine in good faith to be otherwise required in
connection with applicable fiduciary duties after consultation with counsel,
neither Seller nor the Ad Hoc Committee, except as otherwise required by the
Bankruptcy Court, shall knowingly take any action, directly or indirectly, to
cause, promote, authorize, or result in the purchase by any Person other than
Buyer of all or a substantial portion of the stock or assets of Seller, or any
other transaction competing, conflicting or interfering with the completion of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a "Competing Transaction"),
including, without limitation, granting access to any third parties to Seller's

knowledge, relates to, or is reasonably expected to lead to, a Competing
Transaction or a potential Competing Transaction.

                  (c)      If any Person offers to enter into a Competing
Transaction with Seller, except as Seller reasonably determines in good faith to
be required in connection with its applicable fiduciary duties, Seller shall not
(i) consider, or enter into any agreement relating to, any Competing Transaction
or (ii) file any plan of reorganization proposed or supported by the Seller that
does not contemplate a transaction with Buyer or any of its affiliates or
successors, unless (x) the consideration to be paid in connection with the
Competing Transaction or, in the case of such a reorganization plan, the
consideration to be provided to creditors as a result of the transactions
contemplated thereby, is at least Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) in cash
greater than the Purchase Price or the amount of any prior improvement thereto
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.11, and (y) the offer is in
writing, binding on the offeror, and contains closing contingencies no more
substantive than those contained in this Agreement (a "Qualified Competing
Transaction Proposal").

                  (d)      If any person or entity submits a Qualified Competing
Transaction Proposal to Seller, and Seller has made a determination that such
offer is more beneficial to Seller than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Seller shall immediately notify Buyer of such offer and provide Buyer
with a copy of the offer. Buyer shall have five (5) business days after such
notification and receipt of the offer to modify the terms of this Agreement so
as to substantially match or improve the terms offered in the Qualified
Competing Transaction Proposal. If Buyer makes such modification, except as
Seller reasonably determines in good faith to be otherwise required in
connection with applicable fiduciary duties after consultation with counsel,
Seller shall recommend to the Bankruptcy Court that this Agreement, as so
modified by Buyer, be approved by the Bankruptcy Court and shall continue to
perform its obligations under this Agreement. Buyer shall have the same rights
provided in this Section 2.11 with respect to any offers made subsequent to any
such modification of this Agreement.

                  (e)      If, after the date of execution of this Agreement and
prior to the ninetieth (90th) day after the date of the termination of this
Agreement, (i) Seller enters into any Competing Transaction or any agreement to
enter into a Competing Transaction, (ii) the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby shall not have resulted from Seller's
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(a), Section 7.1(c) or
Section 7.1(d), and (iii) Buyer was not in material breach of any of its
obligations under this Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to receive (x) a
breakup fee in the amount of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (the "Breakup
Fee"), and (y) the Expense Reimbursement.

                  (f)      For purposes of this Agreement, "Expense
Reimbursement" means the amount paid or to be paid to Buyer in immediately
available funds equaling the amounts incurred by Buyer as actual out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery,
and attempted performance of this Agreement and the matters contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that the amount of the Expense Reimbursement shall not exceed
Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000). The Expense Reimbursement shall
include, without limitation, all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs,
fees, and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with its due diligence
review, negotiation, and documentation of this Agreement and any of the expenses
contemplated under Section 9.11 and the transactions

                                       15

<PAGE>

contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, reimbursement of all filing
fees paid in connection with filings under the HSR Act and all fees and expenses
paid to Buyer's attorneys, accountants, consultants, and other professional or
financial advisers.

                  (g)      If Buyer has become entitled to payment of the
Breakup Fee pursuant to Section 2.11(e), Seller shall pay the Breakup Fee to
Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds not later than two (2)
business days after the date on which Buyer becomes entitled to payment of the
Breakup Fee.

                  (h)      If Buyer has become entitled to payment of the
Expense Reimbursement pursuant to Section 2.11(e), Seller shall pay the Expense
Reimbursement to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds not later
than ten (10) days after the delivery by Buyer to Seller of a written request
for payment of the Expense Reimbursement and reasonably detailed and accurate
supporting documentation for such request, except to the extent, if any, that
Seller disputes the requested amount. If Seller disputes the amount of the
requested Expense Reimbursement, it shall so advise Buyer in writing and in
reasonable detail within ten (10) days after Seller's receipt of the request and
related supporting documentation. Any undisputed amount shall be timely paid by
Seller to Buyer and the balance of the amount requested by Buyer shall be held
in escrow by Seller for Buyer, and the dispute shall be resolved in good faith
by the parties, if possible. If such disputes have not been resolved by the
parties within ten (10) days after Seller notifies Buyer that it disputes the
amount of the requested Expense Reimbursement, then Seller or Buyer shall
request that the Bankruptcy Court resolve such disputes promptly.

         3.1      Organization.

         Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the state of Colorado, with full corporate power and
authority as a debtor and a debtor in possession subject to the Bankruptcy Code
to own all of its property and assets and to carry on the Business as it is now
being conducted.

         3.2      Authority Relative to Agreement.

         Subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court, Seller has the full
corporate right, power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and

duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action or proceeding.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller and,
subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of Seller, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability is limited by bankruptcy, insolvency and

                                       16

<PAGE>

other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
by general principles of equity.

         3.3      No Conflict.

         The execution and the delivery of this Agreement by Seller and the
consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (a)
violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Seller;
(b) violate any Law applicable to Seller; (c) except with respect to filings
under the HSR Act or the need to seek Bankruptcy Court approval, require Seller
to make any filing with, obtain any permit, Consent, license or approval of, or

amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or right to require repurchase
pursuant to, any Acquired Asset, including, without limitation, any Assigned
Contract.

                  (c)      Schedule 3.4(c) sets forth a correct and complete
list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each material item of Tangible
Property. Seller has good and marketable title to the Tangible Property.

<PAGE>

                  (d)      The Real Property and Tangible Property are in good
condition and repair (subject to routine maintenance and repair for similar
assets of like age and use) and are usable in the Ordinary Course of Business.

the Tangible Property, are located at the Real Property.

                  (e)      The Acquired Assets constitute all the assets and

There are no material unresolved notices of deficiency or charges of violation
pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or materially interfere
with the issuance to Buyer of any required licenses for the operation of the
Business, and there are no facts or circumstances known to Seller that would
constitute a reasonable basis on which any such notices or charges may be
instituted, issued or brought hereafter.

         Except as set forth in Schedule 3.7, there is no pending or, to the

                                    COVENANTS

         5.1      General.

         Each of the parties will use all commercially reasonable efforts to

consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including satisfaction, but not waiver, of the Closing conditions set forth in

         5.2      Bankruptcy Court Approval.

                  (a)      As soon as practicable, but not later than fifteen
(15) days after entry of the Buyer Protection Order, Seller shall file, or cause
to be filed, the Disclosure Statement and the Plan. The Disclosure Statement
shall comply with the requirements of section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code (it
being understood that the adequacy of the Disclosure Statement, at the time of
filing, shall be subject to the resolution of any objections entertained by the
Bankruptcy Court), and the Plan shall comply with the requirements of section
1123 of the Bankruptcy Code and shall be capable of being confirmed pursuant to
section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code (it being understood that the confirmability
of the Plan, at the time of filing, shall be subject to the resolution of any
objections entertained by the Bankruptcy Court). Buyer shall have the
opportunity to review and comment on the Plan and Disclosure Statement (and
proposed service lists) prior to their filing to confirm the Plan is not
inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby. Seller shall request that the Bankruptcy Court set a hearing for

Bankruptcy Court's satisfaction adequate assurance of future performance of all
Assigned Contracts. There shall be no reduction of the Cash Purchase Price, nor
may Buyer terminate this Agreement, due to the exclusion of one or more Assigned
Contracts primarily as a result of Buyer's failure to provide adequate assurance
of future performance in connection therewith.

         5.3      Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Consents and Best
Efforts.

                  (a)      To the extent required by the HSR Act, each of the

file any supplemental or additional information that may be requested in

reasonable efforts to resolve objections, if any, which may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act,
the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and any other Law designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of
trade (collectively "Antitrust Laws"). In the event any Proceeding is threatened
or instituted challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
violative of Antitrust Laws, each party shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid the filing of, or resist or resolve such proceeding. Each party
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as may be
required by: (i) the DOJ and/or the FTC in order to resolve such objections as
either of them may have to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
the Antitrust Laws or (ii) any federal or state court of the United States, or
similar court of competent jurisdiction in any foreign jurisdiction, in any suit
brought by any Governmental Entity or any other Person challenging the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of the Antitrust Laws,
in order to avoid the entry of any order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) which has the effect of preventing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any such order. Buyer shall pay the filing fees required
to be paid by Seller and Buyer under the HSR Act in connection with such
filings.

                  (b)      The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other
and use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Consents from any Person
or Governmental Entity, including Gaming Licenses and the filings pursuant to
subsection (a) above, and satisfy all requirements imposed by any Governmental
Entity, that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the requirements of any party to
fulfill gaming compliance investigation requirements imposed upon it by any
Governmental Entity. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all consents of, and satisfying all requirements imposed by,

                                       23

<PAGE>

all Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein. Each party also shall promptly advise the others upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose Consent is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes
such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any such
Consent will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such Consent will be
materially delayed.

         5.4      Operation of Business.

         Until the Closing, Seller shall, except as otherwise required,
authorized or restricted pursuant to an Order of the Bankruptcy Court, operate
the Business solely in the Ordinary Course of Business. Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business organization, to
maintain the Business, to keep available the services of its officers and
employees and to maintain satisfactory relationships with licensors, licensees,
suppliers, contractors, distributors, consultants, customers and others having
business relationships with Seller in connection with the operation of the
Business. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except as
otherwise expressly provided in or contemplated by this Agreement, on or prior
to the Closing Date, Seller may not, without the prior written consent of Buyer:

                  (a)      modify in any manner the compensation of any of the
Employees, or accelerate the payment of any such compensation (other than in the
Ordinary Course of Business or such that the liability associated with such
modification is excluded from the Assumed Liabilities);

                  (b)      remove or permit to be removed from any building,
facility, or real property any Acquired Asset that, individually or in the
aggregate, is material;

                  (c)      sell, lease or otherwise dispose of, mortgage,
hypothecate or otherwise encumber any Acquired Asset (other than in the Ordinary
Course of Business);

                  (d)      amend, terminate or renew any Assigned Contract
without the approval of the Bankruptcy Court (other than in the Ordinary Course
of Business);

                  (e)      knowingly take any action that would cause any
condition set forth in Article VI not to be met; or

                  (f)      agree, whether in writing or otherwise, to do any of
the foregoing.

         5.5      Compliance with Laws.

         Seller shall comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws
as may be required (a) with respect to the operation of the Business; (b) for
its ownership of the Acquired Assets prior to the Closing; and (c) for the valid
and effective transfer of the Acquired Assets as contemplated by this Agreement
at the Closing.

         5.6      Inspections by Buyer.

         Seller has permitted and will continue to permit representatives of
Buyer (including legal counsel and accountants) to have full access at all
reasonable times, and in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the
normal business operations of Seller, to all premises, properties, personnel,
Books and Records (including tax records), contracts, and documents of or
pertaining to Seller or the Business.

         5.7      Confidentiality.

         Buyer will treat and hold as such any Confidential Information it
receives from Seller (as defined in that certain Nondisclosure and
Confidentiality Agreement between Seller and Buyer dated March 30, 2004 which is
incorporated herein and hereby made a part hereof), and Buyer will not use any
of the Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement, and,
if this Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever, Buyer will either
return to Seller or promptly destroy all tangible embodiments (and all copies)
of the Confidential Information which are in its possession. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer may disclose such information (a) if Buyer is compelled to
disclose the same by judicial or administrative process, any directive of any
Governmental Entity or Gaming Authority or by any other requirement of Law (but
subject to the following provisions of this Section 5.7); (b) if the same
hereafter is in the public domain through no fault of Buyer or (c) if the same
is later acquired by Buyer from another source and Buyer is not aware, after due
inquiry, that such source is under an obligation to another Person to keep such
information confidential. If Buyer is requested or required (by oral questions,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents in any Proceeding to
disclose any such information, Buyer shall, to the extent not prohibited by Law,
provide Seller with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so
that Seller may, at its own expense, seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section
5.7. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of
a waiver by Seller, Buyer nonetheless, based on the advice of counsel, is
required to disclose such Confidential Information to any tribunal or other
Person, Buyer, without liability hereunder, may disclose that portion of such
information which such counsel advises Buyer it is legally required to disclose.
Nothing in this Section 5.7 shall limit the rights of the parties to disclose or
use any confidential or proprietary information of the other parties in
connection with any legal action arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement; provided, that such party shall take reasonable steps to preserve the
confidentiality of such information (including by obtaining an appropriate
protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
afforded such information).

         5.8      Post-Closing Books and Records.

         For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, Seller on the one
hand and Buyer on the other hand shall afford each other and their respective
counsel, accountants and other representatives, or any trustee appointed in the
Bankruptcy Case or any case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code to which the
Bankruptcy Case may be converted, reasonable access to the Books and Records in
respect of the Business which, after the Closing, are in the custody or control
of the other party and which such party reasonably requires in order to comply
with its obligations under Law, including, but not limited to, audits by Tax
authorities, or which Buyer

                                       25

<PAGE>

reasonably requires to comply with its obligations under the Assumed Liabilities
or the Assigned Contracts. Buyer will retain all Books and Records that Buyer
may have, if any, relating and material to the operation of the Business and the
Acquired Assets prior to the Closing for a period of one (1) year after the
Closing Date.

         5.9      Further Assurances.

         At any time and from time to time at or after the Closing, the parties
shall cooperate with each other, to execute and deliver such other documents,
instruments of transfer or assignment, files, Books and Records and do all such
further acts and things as may be reasonably required to carry out the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         5.10     Employee Matters.

         Seller shall, as of the Closing, terminate all employees of the
Business other than the individuals identified on Schedule 5.10 (the
"Employees"), and shall timely deliver to all Employees the required notices of
termination of employment pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act and any similar state statutes (the "WARN Act"). Buyer shall
make offers of employment to all Employees as new employees of Buyer as of the
time of the Closing. Buyer shall cause all Employees hired by Buyer to be
covered by Buyer's employee benefit plans and programs applicable to similarly
situated employees of Buyer. Buyer shall not be required to pay any amounts
otherwise payable to Employees as a result of any severance or change-of-control
provision existing between any Employee and Seller. Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller from and against any and all Damages arising under the WARN
Act incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. To the
extent Seller pays an Assumed Liability under this Section 5.10, such amount
shall be reimbursed by Buyer to Seller within five (5) business days of written
notice thereof.

         5.11     Allocation.

         At least three (3) days prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall
prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price (and all other capitalized costs)
among the Acquired Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
treasury regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law, as appropriate). Seller and Buyer shall report, act, and file Tax
Returns (including, but not limited to Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in
all respects and for all purposes consistent with such allocation. Neither
Seller nor Buyer shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns, or
otherwise) which is inconsistent with such allocation unless required to do so
by applicable law.

         5.12     Ineligible Person.

         At any time after the date of this Agreement, if Buyer, any employee or
director, officer or consultant of Buyer or any holder of capital stock, debt
instruments or other interests in Buyer shall become an Ineligible Person, then
Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cure such event,
which may include (a) the undertaking of any administrative or other Proceeding
before any applicable Gaming Authority or other Governmental Entity, (b) any
action necessary to cease Buyer's relationship with such Ineligible Person,
including requiring the resignation from any position in or relationship with
Buyer or (c) any other action which

                                       26

<PAGE>

Buyer in its sole discretion determines is necessary or appropriate to cause
Buyer to not be affiliated with any Ineligible Person. Each Person who shall be
determined to be an Ineligible Person shall, and Buyer shall use all
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause each Ineligible Person to,
cooperate with Buyer in its efforts to obtain and retain in full force and
effect the Gaming Licenses.

         5.13     Preliminary Title Report.

                  (a)      Not later than four (4) business days after the date
of this Agreement, Seller, with Buyer's assistance and cooperation as necessary,
shall arrange for the Title Company to prepare and deliver to Buyer a
preliminary title report (the "Title Report") covering the Real Property dated
not earlier than the date of this Agreement, such report showing all matters of
record and all items which would be shown as exceptions on a ALTA owner's policy
of title insurance, together with a recent ALTA survey of the Real Property
certified by a licensed land surveyor and a legible copy of each recorded
document underlying any exceptions shown in the Title Report. Subject only to
the following permitted exceptions (the "Permitted Exceptions"), Seller shall
cause all exceptions to title to the Real Property set forth in such Title
Report to be removed prior to the Closing: (1) the standard printed exceptions
contained in the Title Company's form of Owner's Policy; (2) building
restrictions and zoning regulations heretofore or hereafter adopted by any
municipal or other public authority relating to the Property; (3) current
property taxes not yet delinquent; (4) the exceptions approved by Buyer in
accordance with Section 5.13(b); and (5) any exception to which Buyer, in
Buyer's sole discretion, specifically and expressly consents in writing prior to
the Closing. Buyer shall pay all fees and costs associated with obtaining the
Title Report.

                  (b)      Buyer shall have until 5:00 p.m. (Los Angeles time)
on the fifth (5th) calendar day following Buyer's receipt of the Title Report to
disapprove, in Buyer's sole discretion, any matters set forth in the Title
Report; provided, however, that Buyer may not disapprove of the exceptions
described in items (1), (2) and (3) of Section 5.13(a). If Buyer timely
disapproves of any matters set forth in the Title Report, other than with
respect to the exceptions described in items (1), (2) and (3) of Section
5.13(a), Seller shall have three (3) business days to indicate in writing
whether Seller will cause such disapproved matters to be removed as exceptions
to title prior to or concurrently with the Closing. Seller's failure to timely
respond shall be deemed to constitute Seller's irrevocable agreement to remove
all such disapproved matters as exceptions to title. If Seller timely indicates
that it is unwilling to remove any such disapproved matters as exceptions to
title, Buyer may elect to (i) proceed with the transaction contemplated hereby
and take title subject to such disapproved matters, or (ii) terminate this
Agreement. Buyer's failure to make such election within three (3) business days
after being informed of Seller's decision shall be deemed an election of option
(i). If Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.13(b), the
Deposit (and all interest accrued thereon) shall be returned to Buyer, and the
parties shall have no further obligations to one another except for any
obligations that, by their terms, survive the termination of this Agreement.

Seller in this Agreement or pursuant hereto shall survive for a period of twelve
(12) months from and after the Closing Date unless a claim shall have been
commenced by Buyer providing Seller with written notice thereof prior to the
date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, in which case the
applicable representations and warranties shall survive with respect to such
claim until such claim has been resolved.

                  (c)      Buyer shall not be entitled to recover any Damages
under this Article VIII to the extent the aggregate claims (including claims for
Damages arising under Article VI or VII) against Seller are less than Two
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the "Deductible"). Buyer shall only
be entitled to recover Damages in excess of the Deductible. In pursuing the
collection of any Damages against Seller following the Closing, the funds being
held by Escrow Agent pursuant to the Holdback Amount shall be the exclusive
remedy of Buyer. On the date that is twelve (12) months from the Closing Date,
Escrow Agent shall distribute to Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds an amount, if any, equal to the remaining portion of the
Holdback Amount plus accrued interest, exclusive of amounts which Buyer is
entitled to forever retain or for claims that have not yet been resolved
pursuant to this Article VIII.

                  (d)      Except for fraud or criminal misconduct, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions in this Section 8.1 shall be the exclusive remedy of Buyer with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         8.2      Indemnification by Buyer.

                  (a)      Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its officers, directors, employees and agents, for any and all Damages which may
be sustained, suffered or incurred by Seller and arising out of or by reason of
(i) any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or undertaking made by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; or (ii) any liabilities, obligations,
commitments or claims arising with respect to any Acquired Asset or any Assumed
Liability after the Closing Date.

                  (b)      Each of the representations and warranties made by
Buyer in this Agreement or pursuant hereto shall survive for a period of twelve
(12) months from and after the Closing Date, unless a claim shall have been
commenced by Seller's providing Buyer with written notice thereof prior to the
date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, in which case the
applicable representations and warranties shall survive with respect to such
claim until such claim has been resolved.

                  (c)      Seller shall not be entitled to recover any Damages
under this Article VIII to the extent the aggregate claims (including claims for
Damages arising under Article VI or VII) against Buyer are less than the
Deductible. Seller shall only be entitled to recover Damages in excess of the
Deductible. The total liability of Buyer for its indemnity obligations under
this Section 8.2 shall be limited to Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) in the
aggregate.

                  (d)      Except for fraud or criminal misconduct, the parties

         8.3      Indemnification Procedure.

                  (a)      Whenever any claim (a "Claim") shall arise for
indemnification under this Article VIII, the indemnitee shall promptly give
written notice to the indemnifying party with respect to the Claim, which notice
shall include reliable information of the facts constituting the basis for the
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to timely give such notice
shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any obligation under this
Agreement, except to the extent, if any, that the indemnifying party is
materially prejudiced thereby. In the event of any Claim resulting from or in
connection with any claim or legal proceedings by a third party (a "Third Party
Claim"), the notice to the indemnifying party shall specify, if known, the
amount or an estimate of the amount of liability arising therefrom. The
indemnitee shall not settle or compromise any claim by any third party for which
it is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of
the indemnifying party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) unless suit shall have been instituted against it and the indemnifying
party shall not have taken control of such suit after notification thereof as
provided in Section 8.3(c) hereof.

                  (b)      Upon receipt of written notice from the indemnitee of
a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall provide counsel (such counsel
subject to the reasonable approval of the indemnitee) to defend the indemnitee
against the matter from which the Third Party Claim arose, at the indemnifying
party's sole cost, risk and expense. The indemnitee shall cooperate in all
reasonable respects, at the indemnifying party's sole cost, risk and expense,
with the indemnifying party in the investigation, trial, defense and any appeal
arising from the matter from which the Third Party Claim arose. The indemnitee
shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of any such
action, with counsel at its own expense. The indemnifying party shall have the
right to elect to settle any claim for monetary damages without the indemnitee's
consent only if the settlement includes a complete release of the indemnitee. If
the settlement does not include such a release, it will be subject to the
consent of the indemnitee, which will not be unreasonably withheld. The
indemnifying party may not admit any liability of the indemnitee or waive any of
the indemnitee's rights without the indemnitee's prior written consent, which
will not be unreasonably withheld. If the subject of any Third Party Claim
results in a judgment or settlement, the indemnifying party shall promptly pay
such judgment or settlement.

                  (c)      If the indemnifying party (i) fails to assume the
defense of the subject of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms of
Section 8.3(b), (ii) fails diligently to prosecute such defense, or (iii) has,
in the indemnitee's reasonable good faith judgment, a conflict of interest, the
indemnitee may defend against the subject of the Third Party Claim, at the
indemnifying party's sole cost, risk and expense, in such manner and on such
terms as the indemnitee deems appropriate, including, without limitation,
settling the subject of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that any
compromise or settlement shall be subject to the indemnifying party's consent,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. If the indemnitee defends the
subject of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section 8.3(c), the
indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnitee and its counsel, at the
indemnifying party's sole cost, risk and expense, in all reasonable respects,
and shall deliver to the indemnitee or its counsel copies of all pleadings and
other information within the indemnifying party's knowledge or possession
reasonably requested by the indemnitee or its counsel that are relevant

                                       34

<PAGE>

to the defense of the subject of any such Third Party Claim and that will not
prejudice the indemnifying party's position, claims or defenses. The indemnitee
shall maintain confidentiality with respect to all such information consistent
with the conduct of a defense hereunder.

         8.4      Payment of Indemnification.

         All payments owing under this Article VIII will be made promptly as
indemnifiable Losses are incurred. If an indemnitee defends any Third Party
Claim in accordance with Section 8.3(c), the expenses (including attorneys' fees
and costs) incurred by the indemnitee shall be paid by the indemnifying party in
advance of the final disposition of such matter as incurred by the indemnitee;
provided that the indemnitee undertakes in writing to repay any such advances in
the event that it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under the terms of this
Agreement.

         8.5      Treatment of Indemnity Payments.

         To the maximum extent permissible under applicable Tax Laws, the
receipt by any party of any indemnification payment pursuant to this Article
VIII will be treated and reported as a non-taxable adjustment to the Cash
Purchase Price.

         8.6      Insurance.

         No indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article
VIII for Damages covered by insurance proceeds from any insurance policy owned
and paid for by Seller or the Title Policy, to the extent that such indemnitee
actually receives such insurance proceeds to cover such Damages.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         9.1      Survival.

         Seller and Buyer agree that: (a) Buyer's and Seller's representations
and warranties shall survive as provided in Article VIII, (b) Buyer's and
Seller's covenants contained in Article V shall survive in accordance with the
terms thereof and (c) the provisions pertaining to Buyer's and Seller's rights
of indemnification and the provisions respecting confidentiality shall survive
any cancellation or termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions
hereof (and any such cancellation or termination shall not be deemed to
terminate this Agreement in such circumstances insofar as such provisions are
concerned).

         9.2      Press Releases and Public Announcements.

         No party shall issue any press release or make any public announcement
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement prior to the Closing without
the prior written approval of the other party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that, upon notice to the
other party, any party may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith
is required by applicable Law or any listing or trading agreement concerning its
publicly-

                                       35

traded securities, in which case the disclosing party shall advise the other
party prior to making the disclosure.

         9.3      Third-Party Beneficiaries.

         This Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person
other than the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns;
provided, that the members of the Ad Hoc Committee are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this Agreement with the right to enforce the terms hereof.

         9.4      Entire Agreement.

         This Agreement (including the documents referred to herein) constitutes
the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements, or representations by or between the parties,
written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter
hereof.

         9.5      Succession and Assignment.

         This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties named herein and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No
party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other party;
provided, however, that Buyer may (a) assign any or all of its rights and
interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates and (b) designate one or
more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder (in any or all of
which cases Buyer nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of
all of its obligations hereunder).

         9.6      Headings.

         The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

         9.7      Notices.

         All notices, requests, demands, claims, and other communications
hereunder will be in writing. Any notice, request, demand, claim, or other

laws of the State of Colorado. Subject to the terms of any Order of the

occurrence.

         9.10     Severability.

         The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the

enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or part thereof, not essential to the commercial purpose of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or entity or any
circumstance, is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable

provision to other persons, entities or circumstances shall not be affected by
such invalidity or unenforceability.

disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign statute
or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The word "including" shall
mean including without limitation.
