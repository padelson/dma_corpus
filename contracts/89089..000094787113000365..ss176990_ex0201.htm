AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 28, 2013 (this "Agreement"),
among SERVICE CORPORATION INTERNATIONAL, a Texas corporation ("Parent"), RIO

(the "Company"). Capitalized terms are defined herein and in Section 9.03.

  

  

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Louisiana
Business Corporation Law (the "LBCL") and Delaware General Corporation Law
("DGCL"), Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will enter into a business
combination transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into
the Company (the "Merger"), and the Company will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent;

  

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has
(based on the unanimous recommendation of the special committee of the Company
Board comprised of all of the members of the Company Board other than Frank B.
Stewart, Jr. ("FBS") and the chief executive officer of the Company (the
"Special Committee")), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, (a) determined that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger (collectively, the "Transactions"), are fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders, (b)
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions and (c)
resolved to recommend the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of
the Company;

  

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has (a) approved this Agreement
and declared its advisability and (b) resolved to recommend the adoption of
this Agreement by the shareholder of Merger Sub;

  

  

WHEREAS, (a) the board of directors of Parent has approved this Agreement and
(b) immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent, as the sole

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, Parent and certain shareholders of the Company (the "Shareholders")
have entered into a Voting and Support Agreement, dated as of the date hereof
(the "Voting Agreement"), providing that, among other things, the Shareholders
will vote their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of this Agreement and
the Transactions.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent,

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

SECTION 1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the LBCL and DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 1.02 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Shearman and Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New

the third (3rd) Business Day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waiver of those conditions), unless another date or place shall be agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing actually
occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date".

  

  

SECTION 1.03 Effective Time. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the
parties shall file certificates of merger (the "Certificates of Merger") with
the Secretary of State of the State of Louisiana and the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, in such form as is required by, and executed in
accordance with, the applicable provisions of the LBCL and DGCL and the
parties shall make all other filings or recordings required under the LBCL and
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificates of
Merger are duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Louisiana
and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and shall specify in the Certificates of
Merger in accordance with the LBCL and DGCL (the time the Merger becomes
effective being the "Effective Time").

  

  

SECTION 1.04 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the LBCL and DGCL.

  

  

SECTION 1.05 Articles of Incorporation; By-laws. (a) At the Effective Time,
the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Law and such Articles of
Incorporation.

  

  

(b) The By-laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by Law, the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such By-laws.

  

  

SECTION 1.06 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation (and the directors
of the Company shall resign as directors effective at the Effective Time), and
the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until the
earlier of their death, resignation or removal.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

SECTION 2.01 Conversion of Securities. (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

  

  

 

    

  |  

(i)

  |  

each share of Class A Common Stock (each "Class A Common Share") and each
share of Class B Common Stock (each "Class B Common Share" and in any case,
each Class A Common Share or Class B Common Share, a "Share") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Share to
be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii) and any Dissenting Shares) shall
be canceled and shall be converted automatically, subject to Section 2.02,
into the right to receive $13.25 in cash, plus the Additional Per Share
Consideration (if any), without interest (together, rounded to the nearest
penny, the "Merger Consideration"), payable upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 2.02, of the Certificate that formerly evidenced such
Share, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any
dividends declared by the Company in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement with a record date prior to the Effective Time that have not been
paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time;

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(ii)

  |  

each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger
Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(iii)

  |  

each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and exchanged for one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of Class A Common Stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

 

  

(b) "Additional Per Share Consideration" means, if the Closing Date occurs
after the Outside Date, an amount in cash per Share, equal to (i) $0.002178
multiplied by (ii) the number of days elapsed during the Ticking Fee Period.
The term "Ticking Fee Period" means, subject to Section 6.09(c), the period
beginning on the calendar day following the Outside Date and ending on and
including the Closing Date.

  

  

SECTION 2.02 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint a U.S. bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the
Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause
the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of Shares (other than the holders of Company Restricted Stock
and Company Stock Options), cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.01 (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

The Exchange Fund shall not include the Merger Consideration required to be
paid to holders of Company Restricted Stock and Company Stock Options pursuant
to Sections 2.04 and 2.05 (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
"Compensation Merger Consideration"). The Exchange Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Any
interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and
be income of Parent. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The insufficiency or diminution
in value of the Exchange Fund shall not affect Parent's obligation to pay the
Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the extent
sufficient funds are not available at the Company, deposit the Compensation
Merger Consideration (or funds sufficient to make up any shortfall) with the
Company for the benefit of the holders of Company Restricted Stock and Company
Stock Options and the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Compensation Merger
Consideration through its payroll to such holders as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event more than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who was, at
the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration other than holders of Company Restricted Stock pursuant
to Section 2.01: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form
and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the certificates evidencing such Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of any
uncertificated Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares") to the Paying Agent) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
the Uncertificated Shares pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Each holder
of Shares shall be entitled to receive, upon (x) surrender to the Paying Agent
of Certificates, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or
(y) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger
Consideration, without interest, payable for each Share represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as
the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent
after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any dividends declared by the Company in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement with a record date prior to the Effective Time that
have not been paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the applicable
Merger Consideration as provided for herein. No interest shall be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
applicable Compensation Merger Consideration through its payroll to each
holder of Company Restricted Stock and Company Stock Options, less applicable
income and employment taxes and other authorized deductions.

  

  

(c) All cash paid upon the surrender of a Certificate or transfer of an
Uncertificated Share in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or book-entry, as applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of the Company Common Stock for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Company Common
Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter
look only to the Parent for the cash to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.01. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders
of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) None of the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any such Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in respect of such lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.01.

  

  

SECTION 2.03 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be
canceled against delivery of the cash to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.01.

  

  

SECTION 2.04 Company Stock Options. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase Class A Common Shares granted under the Company Equity Plans (each, a
"Company Stock Option"), shall be canceled, by virtue of the Merger, except
that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent
of option holders under the Amended and Restated 1995 Incentive Compensation
Plan, and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay each
holder thereof, promptly after the Effective Time, for each such canceled
Company Stock Option, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (a) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price
of such Company Stock Option by (b) the number of Class A Common Shares such
holder could have acquired pursuant to such Company Stock Option (assuming
full vesting under such canceled award).

As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Company Stock Option shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the cash

which shall be paid pursuant to the payroll procedures of the Surviving
Corporation and in accordance with Section 2.02.

  

  

SECTION 2.05 Company Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of
Company restricted stock ("Company Restricted Stock") shall vest in full, with
all forfeiture and repurchase provisions applicable thereto waived by the
Company. For the avoidance of doubt, holders of Company Restricted Stock shall

Restricted Stock for all purposes hereunder, except that they shall be paid
through the Surviving Corporation's payroll in accordance with the payment
procedures set forth in Section 2.02.

  

  

SECTION 2.06 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As soon as practicable following
the date hereof, the Company shall take all necessary action to suspend the

purchase cycle, and no new offering or purchasing periods shall be commenced.

  

  

SECTION 2.07 Dissenting Shares. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the LBCL, Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by shareholders who filed written objections with the Company and voted
against the Merger at the Company Shareholders' Meeting and who shall have
demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares in accordance with
12:131 of the LBCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.
Such shareholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of 12:131 of the
LBCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by shareholders who shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Shares under 12:131 of the
LBCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate
or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares or transfer of
Uncertificated Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.02.

  

  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the LBCL and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the LBCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (and Parent shall be entitled to

withhold) from the Merger Consideration, Compensation Merger Consideration, or
other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any and all Taxes
as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall
cooperate with Parent in coordinating the deduction and withholding of any
Taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the Company or any Subsidiary
under applicable Tax Law, including payroll Taxes relating to payments made in
respect of Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Stock. Any Taxes
deducted and withheld in accordance with this Section 2.08 shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Restricted Stock, as the case may be,
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

of this Agreement and, subject to Section 6.04, as of the Closing, the Company
Board (based on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee), by
resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote of those voting at a meeting duly
called and held and not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way, has
duly (i) determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and
in the best interests of, the Company and its shareholders, (ii) approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions and (iii) recommended
the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company and directed
that this Agreement and the Transactions be submitted for consideration by the

the Company necessary to approve this Agreement and the Transactions is the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the voting
power present at the Company Shareholders' Meeting in favor of the approval of
this Agreement (the "Company Shareholder Approval").

  

  

(c) Assuming the accuracy of Parent's and Merger Sub's representations that,
prior to the time the Company Board approved this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement and transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, neither was, nor
was an "affiliate" of, an "interested shareholder," as those terms are defined
for purposes of LBCL Sections 132-134, the Company has taken all action
necessary to exempt this Agreement and the Transactions from Sections 132-134
and Sections 135-140.2 of the LBCL, and, except for Sections 92(G) and
130-130.2 of the LBCL, no other antitakeover, "control share acquisition",
"business combination", "fair price", "moratorium" or other similar Law
enacted under Louisiana Law (any such Law, including Sections 132-134 and
Sections 135-140.2 of the LBCL, a "Takeover Law") applies to this Agreement or
the Transactions. The Company does not have in effect any stockholder rights
plan, "poison pill" or similar plan or arrangement.

reported by the Company pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K (any such event
or relationship, an "Affiliate Transaction").

  

  

SECTION 3.23 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Special Committee has received
the opinion of Goldman, Sachs and Co., dated the date of this Agreement and
which has not been amended or modified as of the date hereof, to the effect
that, as of the date of this Agreement and subject to the limitations,
qualifications and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the $13.25 in cash
to be paid to the holders of Class A Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders, a copy of which
opinion will be delivered to Parent for informational purposes only promptly
after the date of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 3.24 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than
Goldman, Sachs and Co.) is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Company, except as may arise after the date of this
Agreement pursuant to the Company's engagement letter with Goldman, Sachs and
Co., in the event of an actual or potential conflict of interest. The Company
has heretofore furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy of all
agreements between the Company and Goldman, Sachs and Co., pursuant to which
such firm would be entitled to any payment relating to the Transactions.

power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being

delay Parent or Merger Sub from performing their obligations under this
Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 4.02 Authority. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary

constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a default) under, or give to others any right of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any
Lien on any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to any material
Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, except, with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults
or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the aggregate,

otherwise prevent or materially delay Parent and Merger Sub from performing
their obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or

requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, Blue Sky Laws, the HSR Act, any
filings required to be made with NYSE or NASDAQ and the filing and recordation
of appropriate merger documents as required by the LBCL and DGCL, and (ii)
where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or

material obligations under this Agreement.

Person at the request of FBS or at the request of any Person known by Parent
to be acting at the direction of FBS.

SECTION 4.04 Financing. (a) Parent has provided the Company with a true and
complete (except as otherwise described below) copy of the fully executed
commitment letter (the "Financing Letter"), dated as of the date hereof, by
and among the parties named therein (collectively, and together with any
exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto in effect as of the date
hereof, the "Financing Commitments," and the lenders party thereto, the
"Financing Sources"), pursuant to which the Financing Sources have agreed,
subject to and on the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend or

and its Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 4.04 (the "Scheduled Indebtedness")
and (iii) finance the payment of fees, expenses, accrued interest and
premiums, as applicable, related to the provision of the Financing, including
the Proposed Refinancing. Other than as expressly set forth in the Financing
Commitments, there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts,
understandings or arrangements relating to (or that could affect the
availability of) the Financing to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates is a party (except for customary non-disclosure agreements, fee
letters and engagement letters, true and complete copies of which fee letters
have been provided to the Company, with fees, economic terms and other
customary provisions redacted, none of which would adversely affect the
aggregate amount, conditionality or availability of the Financing or contain
any conditions precedent to the Financing).

precedent to the obligations of the Financing Sources to make the full amount
of the Financing available to the parties specified therein on the terms
contained therein.

  

  

(c) Subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Article III such that the closing condition in Section
7.02(a) would be met and the compliance by the Company of its covenants in
Section 6.08, upon funding of the Financing in accordance with the Financing
Commitments, Parent and Merger Sub will, together with the cash on hand at
Parent, have funds sufficient to pay in full the aggregate Merger
Consideration, effect the Proposed Refinancing and pay in full all other
amounts (including all fees and expenses) required to be paid by Parent or
Merger Sub under this Agreement.

  

  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement: (i) the Financing Letter is in full
force and effect and constitutes a valid, binding and enforceable obligation
of Parent, Merger Sub and, to Parent's and Merger Sub's knowledge, each of the
other parties thereto (subject, in each case, to the Bankruptcy Exceptions);
(ii) no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or an
incurable failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent, any of the other parties to the
Financing Letter, under the Financing Commitments; (iii) subject to the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Article III such that the closing condition in Section 7.02(a) would be met
and the compliance by the Company of its covenants in Section 6.08, there is
no fact or occurrence existing that would reasonably be expected to (A) result
in any of the conditions in the Financing Letter not being satisfied or (B)
otherwise result in the Financing not being available to Parent and Merger Sub
on the Closing Date and (iv) the Financing Letter has not been modified,
amended or altered since executed copies thereof were delivered to the Company
and the commitments contained in the Financing Letter have not been withdrawn
or rescinded in any respect.

Company Board approves this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, neither Parent nor Merger Sub was itself, nor
was an "affiliate" of, an "interested shareholder," as those terms are defined
for the purposes of LBCL Sections 132-134.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

SECTION 6.01 Proxy Statement. (a) Each of the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, and in any event within thirty (30)
days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC the preliminary proxy statement to be sent to the shareholders of
the Company relating to the Company Shareholders' Meeting (such proxy
statement, as amended or supplemented, being referred to herein as the "Proxy
Statement"); provided, however, that the Company shall furnish such
preliminary Proxy Statement to Parent and give Parent and its legal counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review such preliminary Proxy Statement prior to
filing with the SEC and shall consider in good faith all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested by Parent in connection therewith. The Company
shall notify Parent of the receipt of any comments of the SEC staff with
respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC for
any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall
provide to Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable, copies of all written
correspondence between the Company or any Representative of the Company and
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. If comments are received from the
SEC staff with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company shall
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to the comments of the SEC. The
Company shall provide Parent and its legal counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any proposed response to any comment of
the SEC staff and any amendment or supplement to each of the preliminary and
the definitive Proxy Statement prior to filing with the SEC and shall consider
in good faith all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by
Parent in connection therewith. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide
the Company with such information as may be required to be included in the
Proxy Statement or as may be reasonably required to respond to any comment of
the SEC staff. Promptly after all the comments received from the SEC have been
cleared by the SEC staff, or promptly following confirmation from the SEC
staff that they will not be commenting thereon, the Company shall file the
definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated (including by electronic delivery if permitted) as promptly as
reasonably practicable, to its shareholders of record, as of the record date
established by the Company Board. Each of the parties shall correct promptly
any information provided by it to be used specifically in the Proxy Statement
that constitutes an untrue statement of a material fact or fails to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and shall take all steps necessary to file with the SEC and
have cleared by the SEC any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
as to correct the same and to cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case to the extent
required by applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Except as provided in Section 6.04(d) and Section 6.04(e), the Company
covenants that (i) the Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the
Company Board to the shareholders of the Company in favor of the approval of
this Agreement and approval of the Merger (the "Company Recommendation") and
(ii) none of the Company Board or any committee thereof shall withdraw or
modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation.

  

  

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall ensure that the information supplied
by the Company or Parent, as applicable, for inclusion in the Proxy Statement
shall not, at (i) the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC, (ii) the time the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the
shareholders of the Company, and (iii) the time of the Company Shareholders'
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fail to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company shall ensure that the documents that the Company
is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger or the
other Transactions will comply as to form and substance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act.

  

  

SECTION 6.02 Company Shareholders' Meeting. The Company, acting through the
Company Board, shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Governing Documents, as promptly as practicable after all the comments
received from the SEC, if any, on the preliminary Proxy Statement have been
cleared by the SEC staff or promptly following confirmation from the SEC staff
that they will not be commenting thereon, (i) duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholders'
Meeting") (and in any event no later than twenty (20) Business Days after the
dissemination of the Proxy Statement to the Company's shareholders) for the
purpose of considering and taking action on this Agreement and the Merger and
(ii) use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in
favor of the approval of this Agreement and approval of the Merger; provided,
however, that the Company Board need not comply with the foregoing clause (ii)
if the Company Board has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with Section 6.04(d) or Section 6.04(e). Neither the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any Competing
Transaction (whether or not a Superior Proposal), nor any furnishing of
information, discussions or negotiations with respect thereto, nor any
decision or action by the Company Board to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change shall give the Company any right to delay, defer or adjourn the Company
Shareholders' Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjourn
or postpone the Company Shareholders' Meeting to the extent the Company
determines any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is required by
Law to be provided to the Company's shareholders or, if as of the time of the
Company Shareholders' Meeting, there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Shareholders' Meeting;
provided, however, that no adjournment may be to a date on or after three (3)
Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

SECTION 6.03 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) During the period

the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, upon reasonable
notice, the Company shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to (i)
afford Parent and its authorized directors, officers, employees, potential
Financing Sources and Representatives reasonable access to the business,
properties, assets, employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; and (ii) furnish to Parent and its authorized
directors, officers, employees, potential Financing Sources and
Representatives such additional financial and operating data and other
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries (or copies thereof) as
Parent may from time to time reasonably request; provided, however, that any
such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at Parent's
expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision of a director,
officer, employee or Representative of the Company and in such a manner as not
to interfere with the normal operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide, or cause to be provided,
any such access or disclose any such information to Parent or its authorized
directors, officers, employees, potential Financing Sources or Representatives
if such disclosure would, in the Company's reasonable discretion, (x)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege; or (y) contravene any
applicable Law, Order, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior
to the date of this Agreement. The Company may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to Parent under this Section 6.03(a) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material".
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
Parent's outside antitrust counsel or a designated in house counsel of Parent
approved by the Company and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel or
in-house counsel to directors, officers, other employees, potential Financing
Sources or Representatives of Parent unless express permission is obtained in
advance from the Company or its outside legal counsel.

  

  

(b) All information obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality and Standstill
Agreement, dated February 18, 2013, as amended May 8, 2013 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), between Parent and the Company.

  

  

SECTION 6.04 No Solicitation of Transactions. (a) Except as expressly
permitted by this Section 6.04, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and employees
to, and shall direct and use reasonable best efforts to cause any agents,
financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, auditors and
other representatives (collectively, "Representatives") of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to: (i) immediately cease any ongoing solicitation,
knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be
ongoing with respect to a Competing Transaction, and promptly (A) instruct (to
the extent it has contractual authority to do so and has not already done so
prior to the date of this Agreement) or otherwise request, any Person that has
executed a confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement within the 36-month
period prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with any actual or
potential Competing Transaction to return or destroy all such information or
documents or material incorporating confidential information in the possession
of such Person or its Representatives and (B) cause any physical or virtual
data room to no longer be accessible to or by any Person other than Parent or
its Affiliates and Representatives; and (ii) until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01,
not, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information) any
inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Transaction, (B)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any nonpublic
information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, a Competing Transaction (other than, solely in response to an
unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring Person to this Section 6.04 and to
limit its conversation or other communication exclusively to such referral),
or (C) approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend or
enter into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment,

Except to the extent necessary to take any actions that the Company or any
third party would otherwise be permitted to take pursuant to this Section 6.04
(and in such case only in accordance with the terms hereof), (i) the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not release any third party from, or waive, amend
or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, (x) any standstill
provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or (y) any confidentiality provision in any agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party other than, with respect to this
clause (y), any waiver, amendment, modification or permission under a
confidentiality provision that does not, and would not be reasonably likely
to, facilitate, encourage or relate in any way to a Competing Transaction or a
potential Competing Transaction (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enforce the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any
such agreement, and (iii) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, immediately take all steps within their power necessary to terminate any
waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any Person other than Parent
or any of Parent's Affiliates or Representatives, under any such provisions.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.04(a), if
at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company, directly or indirectly receives
a bona fide, written Competing Transaction from any Person that did not result
from a breach of this Section 6.04, and if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Competing Transaction constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may, directly or
indirectly, (i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
information (including nonpublic information) with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties, assets,
employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to the Person who has made such Competing Transaction and its
Representatives and potential Financing Sources; provided, however, that the
Company shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such Person
provide to Parent any nonpublic information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such Person, its
Representatives and/or its potential Financing Sources unless such nonpublic
information has been previously provided or made available to Parent, and (ii)
engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person making such Competing Transaction and its Representatives and potential
Financing Sources regarding such Competing Transaction. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means any customary
confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable
to the Company in any material respect than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (including standstill restrictions), provided that
such confidentiality agreement (x) shall not prohibit compliance by the
Company with any of the provisions of this Section 6.04 and (y) may contain a
less restrictive standstill restriction or no standstill restriction, in which
case the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to contain
only such less restrictive provision, or to omit such provision, as
applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than forty-eight (48)
hours after receipt) notify, orally and in writing, Parent after receipt by
the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
of any Competing Transaction, including of the identity of the Person making
the Competing Transaction and the material terms and conditions thereof, and
shall promptly (and in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours after
receipt) provide copies to Parent of any written proposals, indications of
interest, and draft agreements relating to such Competing Transaction. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, as to the
status of (including changes to any material terms of, and any other material
developments with respect to) such Competing Transaction (including by
promptly (and in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt)
providing to Parent copies of any additional or revised written proposals,
indications of interest, or draft agreements relating to such Competing
Transaction). The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter
into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with this Section 6.04.

  

  

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.04(d) or Section 6.04(e),
the Company Board shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or
authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or make any recommendation or
public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer (other
than as provided in Section 6.04(f)) or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend to shareholders of the Company
a Competing Transaction (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (ii) authorize, cause
or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any
Competing Transaction (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with Section 6.04(b)).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may
(x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.01(d)(ii) in order to enter into a binding written
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a "Superior Proposal
Agreement"), in each case if, after receiving a bona fide Competing
Transaction, the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that (I) such Competing Transaction constitutes a Superior Proposal and (II)
in light of such Competing Transaction, the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; provided, however, that, prior to taking the action set forth in clause
(x) or (y) above, as applicable, (1) the Company has given Parent at least
three (3) Business Days' prior written notice (a "Adverse Recommendation
Change Notice") of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal) and
has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Superior Proposal, a
copy of any proposed transaction agreements with the Person making such
Superior Proposal and, to the extent available to the Company, a copy of any
financing commitments relating thereto (or, if not provided in writing to the
Company, a written summary of the material terms thereof), (2) the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) following the end of such notice period,
the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given
effect, and (4) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms
(including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any
other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (1) above of this proviso and a new notice period under
clause (1) of this proviso shall commence (except that the three (3) Business
Day period notice period referred to in clause (1) above of this proviso shall
instead be equal to the longer of (I) two (2) Business Days and (II) the
period remaining under the notice period under clause (1) of this proviso
immediately prior to the delivery of such additional notice under this clause
(4)) during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.04(d) anew with respect to such additional
notice, including clauses (1) through (4) above of this proviso.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.04,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response
to an Intervening Event, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after
having received the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company
Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that the Company shall
not be entitled to exercise its right to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this Section 6.04(e) unless:

  

   

 

 

     |  

(i)

  |  

the Company has provided written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Intervening
Event") advising Parent that an Intervening Event has occurred, describing in
reasonable detail the applicable material fact, event, change, development or
set of circumstances giving rise to the Intervening Event, indicating that the
Company Board intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and the manner
in which it intends (or may intend) to do so and including such evidence in
the possession of the Company Board with respect to the applicable material
fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances constitutes an
Intervening Event; and

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(ii)

  |  

Parent does not, within three (3) Business Days of receipt of the Notice of
Intervening Event, make an offer or proposal to revise the terms of this
Agreement, including an increase in, or modification of, the Merger
Consideration, in a manner that the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment, after having received the advice of its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer be inconsistent with the Company
Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

35  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.04 or in Section 6.12 shall prohibit
the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication or any other similar disclosure to the Company's shareholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, or making any other
disclosure or communication to the Company's shareholders relating to a
Competing Transaction, if, in the Company Board's determination in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure so to disclose or
communicate would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or its obligations under applicable federal securities
Law; provided, however, that any such disclosure shall be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly and
concurrently reaffirms the Company Recommendation (it being understood that it
shall not be an Adverse Recommendation Change if in such disclosure the
Company Board also makes a statement to the effect that it is reviewing and/or
considering the Competing Transaction, as long as it also reaffirms the
Company Recommendation).

  

  

(g) "Competing Transaction" means any proposal to engage in any transaction or
series of related transactions (other than the Transactions) that constitute,
or may reasonably be expected to lead to (i) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than such transactions solely among any of the Company's Subsidiaries);
(ii) any sale, lease, license, exchange, transfer or other disposition of, or
joint venture involving, assets or businesses that constitute or represent
more than 15% of the total revenue, operating income, EBITDA or fair market
value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
(iii) any sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition of more than 15% of
any class of equity securities, or securities convertible into or exchangeable
for equity securities, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) any
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any
Person becoming the Beneficial Owner of more than 15% of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or; (v) any combination
of the foregoing.

  

  

(h) "Intervening Event" shall mean, with respect to the Company, a material
event or circumstance that was not known to the Company Board on the date of
this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which are not known to or
reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date hereof), which
event or circumstance, or any material consequences thereof, becomes known to
the Company Board at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Approval being
obtained; provided that no fact, event, change, development or set of
circumstances shall constitute an Intervening Event if such fact, event,
change, development or set of circumstances resulted from, arose out of or
relates to any Competing Transaction.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) "Significant Competing Transaction" means a Competing Transaction, but
with each reference to "15%" in the definition of "Competing Transaction"
replaced with "50%".

  

  

(j) "Superior Proposal" means an written bona fide offer or proposal made by a
third party with respect to a Significant Competing Transaction on terms and
conditions that the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment,
after having received the advice of its outside financial advisor and its
outside legal counsel, and taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or proposal or
otherwise, to be (i) more favorable, including from a financial point of view,
to the shareholders of the Company than the Transactions and (ii) reasonably
expected to be consummated.

  

  

SECTION 6.05 Employee Benefits Matters. (a) From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to honor in accordance with their terms, all contracts,
agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
applicable to any current or former Service Provider of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company. Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company shall receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate,

program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) for service accrued or deemed accrued
prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
to the same extent such credit was provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit. In
addition, Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on
benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions to the extent such conditions
are covered immediately prior to the Effective Time under the applicable Plans
and to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan
of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) and use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, for purposes of annual
deductible and out of pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out of pocket expenses paid by employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall fully comply with all notice, consultation, effects
bargaining or other bargaining obligations to any labor union, labor
organization, or group of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Transactions.

  

  

(c) This Section 6.05 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section
6.05, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any current or former Service Provider
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, or, on or
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, their dependents and
beneficiaries) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Section 6.05 or is intended to be, shall constitute or be
construed as, an amendment to or modification of, any employee benefit plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Nothing herein shall be deemed to create any right to employment or continued
employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with Parent or
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation). Except as specifically
provided in this Section 6.05(c), nothing in this Section 6.05 or any other
provision of this Agreement shall limit the ability of Parent or its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement
at any time.

  

  

SECTION 6.06 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted under the
LBCL, honor the Company's and its Subsidiaries' obligations existing
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement to exculpate, indemnify and
hold harmless, and advance expenses to, each present and former director and
officer of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and each such individual
who served at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a director,
officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise other than the Company or a Subsidiary thereof
(each, an "Indemnified Party"), in accordance with the terms of the Governing
Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Indemnification Contracts
and applicable Law, in each case in effect immediately prior to the date of
this Agreement. The Governing Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall, for a period of at least six (6) years following the
Effective Date, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and expense advancement than are set forth in the
Governing Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a six (6) year "tail"
prepaid officers' and directors' liability insurance policy and fiduciary
liability insurance policy, providing, for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, the Company's current and former directors and officers (as
defined to mean those persons insured under the Company's existing officers'
and directors' liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance
policy) with insurance and indemnification policy coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (together, the "DandO Insurance")
that is no less favorable than the existing policies (including that such
purchase does not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time); provided, however, that the
Company shall not pay an aggregate amount for the DandO Insurance in excess of
300% of the current aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company for the
existing policies, but in such case shall purchase such coverage under six (6)
year "tail" prepaid policies as shall then be available at an aggregate cost
no greater than 300% of such rates. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall continue to honor its obligations under the DandO
Insurance and shall not cancel nor take any action or omit to take any action
that would result in the cancellation thereof.

  

  

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 6.06 shall be in
addition to any rights such individual may have under the Governing Documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the LBCL or any other
applicable Laws or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Parent guarantees the performance of the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 6.06.

  

  

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.06.

  

  

SECTION 6.07 Notification of Certain Matters. From the date hereof through the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company of (a) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which could
reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; (b) any
failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply
with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder; (c) any notice or other communication received by such party
from any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or the other
Transactions or from any other Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the Merger if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent
purports to materially affect the consummation of the Merger; and (d) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
party's knowledge, threatened against such party or any of its Subsidiaries
which purports to materially affect the consummation of the Merger; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.07 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

  

  

SECTION 6.08 Financing; Financing Cooperation; Consent/Tender Offers; Company
Warrants. (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments, (ii)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and subject
only to the conditions contemplated by the Financing Commitments, subject to
Section 6.08(c), and (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain a waiver of)
all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing
set forth in the Financing Commitments and the definitive agreements relating
to the Financing (the "Financing Agreements"). If all conditions to the
Financing Commitments have been satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Financing
on the Closing Date in accordance with the Financing Commitments, including,
upon the written request of the Company, commencing litigation proceedings
against the Financing Sources in which Parent shall seek to compel the
Financing Sources to promptly provide the Financing as required by the
Financing Commitments, provided that in no event shall Parent or any Affiliate
of Parent be required to seek any damages from any such Financing Sources.
Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, take any
action that is a breach of, or would result in termination of, any of the
Financing Commitments or the effect of which is to impair, delay or prevent
Parent's obtaining the Financing. If any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing
Commitments, Parent shall, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence
of such event, use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
Alternative Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions
in accordance with Section 6.08(d).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of (i) any default or breach
(or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or breach) by any party
under the Financing Commitments or the Financing Agreements of which Parent or
Merger Sub becomes aware, (ii) any termination of the Financing Commitments,
(iii) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from
any Person with respect to any actual or potential default, breach,
termination or repudiation of the Financing Commitments, any Financing
Agreement or any provision of the Financing Commitments or the Financing
Agreements, in each case by any party thereto, or (iv) if for any reason
Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Financing Commitments or the Financing Agreements,
as the case may be. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date the
Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating
to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the
immediately preceding sentence. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing.

  

  

(c) Parent shall have the right, at its option, to amend, supplement, or
modify the Financing Commitments; provided, however, that it shall not agree
to or permit any amendments, supplements, or modifications to, or grant any
waivers of, any condition or other provision under the Financing Commitments
or the Financing Agreements without the prior written consent of the Company
if such amendments, supplements, modifications or waivers would (i) with
respect to the Financing Commitments, reduce (or would reasonably be expected
to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Financing), (ii) impose new or additional conditions or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the Financing, or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any other provision of the Financing
Commitments that would be reasonably likely to prevent or impede, interfere
with, hinder or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or (iii)
otherwise be reasonably likely to prevent, impede, interfere with, hinder or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided that notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled from time
to time to (x) amend, restate, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or
waive any of its rights under, the Financing Commitments or substitute other
financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same or alternative
financing sources, and (y) amend, restate, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify the Financing Commitments for the purpose of adding agents, co-agents,
lenders, arrangers, bookrunners or other Persons that have not executed the
Financing Commitments as of the date hereof, in each case, subject to
subclauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above. Upon any such amendment, supplement or
modification, in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.08(c), the term
"Financing Commitments" shall mean for all purposes of this Agreement the
Financing Commitments as so amended, supplemented or modified. Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company true and complete copies of any such
amendment, supplement or modification (with only the fee amounts and certain
other provisions redacted, which redacted provisions do not relate to the
aggregate amount, availability or conditionality of the Financing, or contain
any conditions precedent to the Financing).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable or Parent becomes
aware of any event or circumstance that makes or would reasonably be expected
to make any portion of the Financing unavailable, and such portion is required
to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration, refinance the Scheduled
Indebtedness to the extent required under the terms of such Indebtedness or
finance the payment of fees, expenses, accrued interest and premiums, as
applicable, related to the provision of the Financing or the refinancing of
the Scheduled Indebtedness, Parent shall (i) promptly notify the Company of
such unavailability and the reason therefor and (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain, and negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the Financing Sources
(or, as the case may be, alternative financial institutions) in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions (each such alternative financing, an
"Alternative Financing"), as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true
and complete copies of all contracts or other arrangements relating to such
Alternative Financing (except for customary engagement and fee letters,
redacted copies of which will be delivered to the Company to the extent such
letters include "flex" provisions (other than fees or pricing terms) affecting
the terms or amount of the Alternative Financing), and Parent and Merger Sub
shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of
the Financing and any material developments relating to the Financing,
including providing to the Company copies of definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing and all other material documents related to the
Financing (with only the fee amounts and certain other provisions redacted,
which redacted provisions do not relate to the aggregate amount of or,
conditionality of, or contain any conditions precedent to, the Financing). For
all purposes of this Agreement, (x) the term "Financing Commitment" shall be
deemed to include any financing commitments or definitive financing agreements
with respect to any Alternative Financing, (y) the term "Financing" shall be
deemed to include any Alternative Financing and (z) the term "Financing
Agreements" shall be deemed to include any definitive financing agreements
with respect to any Alternative Financing.

  

  

(e) If any condition or other provision of the Financing Commitments is
amended, supplemented or modified, in any material respect, or if any
Alternative Financing is obtained for any portion of the Financing, in each
case, in accordance with Sections 6.08 (c) and (d), then each of Parent and
the Company shall comply with its covenants set forth herein with respect to
the Financing Commitments, as so amended, modified or waived and with respect
to such Alternative Financing to the same extent that Parent and the Company
would have been obligated to comply with respect to the Financing, as the case
may be.

  

  

(f) From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the Closing Date and (ii)
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use
its reasonable best efforts, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the respective Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
use reasonable best efforts, in each case at the Parent's sole cost and
expense, to cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub, as such cooperation may be
reasonably required or requested in connection with the Financing, including:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(A) participating in meetings, presentations, road shows and rating agency
sessions, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, including
participation by senior management of the Company and participation in
sessions with prospective Financing sources and potential lenders or investors
in the Financing, including direct contact between senior management of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Financing Sources and
potential lenders or investors in the Debt Financing on the other hand, in
each case to the extent reasonably necessary for the Financing; (B) furnishing
Parent, the Financing Sources and potential lenders or investors in the Debt
Financing with the Required Information; (C) assisting Parent and the
Financing Sources in the preparation of (i) offering memoranda, private
placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents for any portion of the
Financing ("Offering Documents") identifying any portion of any Company
information contained in any Offering Documents that constitute material non-
public information and (ii) materials for rating agency presentations and
lender and investor presentations, business projections (with respect to
Company information only), bank confidential information memoranda and similar
documents in connection with the Financing; (D) cooperating with the marketing
and syndication efforts for any portion of the Financing (including using
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the syndication efforts benefit from
the Company's existing lending relationships and arranging for reasonable
direct contact between senior management and the Representatives of the
Company with prospective Financing Sources); (E) using reasonable best efforts
to obtain customary legal opinions, consents (including consents with respect
to inclusion of the Company's financial statements in any prospectus or
offering memorandum or similar documents for any portion of the Financing) and
customary comfort letters (which letters such accountants have confirmed they
are prepared to issue upon pricing and at closing of any applicable Financing
(with respect to any debt securities)) of the Company's independent
accountants (including "negative assurance" comfort) and execute any customary
representation letters to the accountants in connection therewith; (F)
furnishing promptly, to the extent reasonably requested by the Financing
Sources, all documentation and other information about the Company that is
required by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Financing under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the PATRIOT Act; (G) providing customary authorization
letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information
pertaining to the Company and its Subsidiaries to prospective lenders and
containing a customary "10b-5" representation with respect to information
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries and a customary representation
that the "public side" versions, if any, of the relevant documents do not
include material non-public information with respect to the Company, (H) using
reasonable best efforts to assist in the preparation of one or more credit
agreements, indentures, purchase agreements and other definitive financing
documents as may be reasonably requested by the Parent, (I) reasonably
cooperating in satisfying the conditions precedent set forth in the Financing
Commitments or any Financing Agreement to the extent the satisfaction of such
condition requires the cooperation of, or is within the control of, the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (J) arranging for customary payoff letters,
lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered on the Closing
Date relating to all indebtedness to be paid off, discharged and terminated on
the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing: (I) except to the extent necessary to authorize
actions set forth in clauses (A) through (J) in the immediately preceding
sentence or to authorize actions set forth in Section 6.08(g), none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors of the
Company shall be required to pass resolutions or consents to approve or
authorize the execution of the Financing or any documents or instruments with
respect to the Financing, and no such corporate action that may be taken by
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any such Persons shall be required to
be effective prior to the Effective Time; (II) no obligation of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives under any
certificate, document or instrument executed pursuant to the foregoing shall
be effective until the Effective Time (other than authorization and
representation and warranty letters described in clauses (E) and (G) above);
(III) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives shall be required to (w) pay any commitment or other similar
fee in connection with the Financing, (x) have any liability or obligation
prior to the Effective Time under any agreement, certification or other
document related to the Financing, except in connection with the transactions
contemplated by Section 6.08(g), (y) incur any other expense (other than out-
of pocket and other immaterial expenses incurred in cooperating with Parent
and Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 6.08(f), it being understood that all
such expenses shall be subject to reimbursement by Parent in accordance with
this Section 6.08(f)) in connection with the Financing or (z) provide
indemnification under any agreement, except in connection with the
transactions contemplated by Section 6.08(g), in each case prior to the
Effective Time; (IV) no obligation set forth herein shall unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (V) no obligation set forth herein will require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that will conflict with or violate
any of their Contracts or Governing Documents or applicable Law; (VI) assets
excluded as collateral under the Company's Credit Agreement, including Real
Property and vehicles, shall not be available as collateral to secure the
Financing; and (VII) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives shall be required to furnish the Parent or any of
the Financing Sources with any of the following: (a) any description of all or
any component of the Financing, including any such description to be included
in liquidity and capital resources disclosure or any "description of notes,"
(b) risk factors relating to all or any component of the Financing, (c) in the
case of pro forma data, (x) any post-Closing or pro forma projections, cost
savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other post-Closing or pro
forma adjustments (and the assumptions relating thereto) desired by Parent to
be reflected in such pro forma data, and (y) any other information concerning
the assumptions underlying the post-Closing or pro forma adjustments to be
made in such pro forma and summary financial data, which information and
assumptions shall be the responsibility of Parent; and (d) any Subsidiary or
other financial statements or information required by Rules 3-09, 3-10 or 3-16
of Regulation S-X or Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by
Regulation S-K Item 402(b), except to the extent already contained in the
Company's reports filed with or furnished to the SEC. Nothing contained in
this Section 6.08(f) or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, prior to the Effective Time, to be an issuer or other obligor
with respect to the Financing or to be a registrant under a Securities Act
registration statement. The Company hereby consents to the use of the
Company's logos in connection with the marketing of the Financing; provided,
however, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to
or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) At the reasonable request of Parent, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent and
Merger Sub in obtaining any consents or waivers to, and giving notices of
redemption in respect of, its Scheduled Indebtedness, provided that none of
the foregoing shall be required to be effective prior to the Effective Time
and no irrevocable notice of redemption shall be given prior to the Effective
Time. At the reasonable request of Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to commence
consent solicitations or issuer tender or exchange offers with respect to any
applicable Scheduled Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
("Consent/Tender Offers"), in each case in consultation with Parent. All
Consent/Tender Offers shall be in accordance with applicable Law and the
documents governing the Scheduled Indebtedness and shall be on such terms and
conditions as reasonably specified by Parent in consultation with the Company;
provided, however, that all Consent/Tender Offers (and all obligations to make
any payments to holders of all or any portion of any Scheduled Indebtedness in
connection therewith or to modify the terms or provisions of any Scheduled
Indebtedness) shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, and
shall terminate immediately upon the termination of this Agreement prior to
the Effective Time. The Company shall retain the financial institution
reasonably requested by Parent to act as sole solicitation agent, sole dealer
manager or both in connection with the Consent/Tender Offers. In addition, at
the reasonable request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to assist Parent in arranging for the Company or Parent to repay any
outstanding Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement effective at the Effective
Time.

  

  

(h) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
negotiate with the Calculation Agent to minimize the costs to the Company (or
the Surviving Corporation) associated with the cancellation of the Company
Warrants that will be caused by the consummation of the Transactions. The
Company shall include Parent, and Parent shall be entitled to participate, in
any discussions or negotiations between the Company and the Calculation Agent
or any other Person in respect of the cancellation and settlement of the
Company Warrants and, without Parent's prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld), the Company shall not make any payment with respect
to, or settle or agree to any settlement in respect of, the Company Warrants.

  

  

(i) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Financing Sources or other Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.08 shall
be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

  

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
condition set forth in Section 7.02(b), as it applies to the Company's
obligations under Section 6.08(f), (g) and (h) shall be deemed satisfied
unless the Company's breaches of its obligations under Section 6.08(f), (g)
and (h) prevented Parent or Merger Sub from having funds available to fund the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the Proposed Refinancing and related fees,
expenses, accrued interest and premiums.

  

  

(k) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
cooperation described in Section 6.08(f) and Section 6.08(g) and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives for and against any and all losses, claims, costs
and expenses actually suffered or incurred by them, as incurred, in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing or any action taken by them at the
request of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to Section 6.08(f) and Section
6.08(g), except in the event it is determined by a competent court in a final
and non-appealable judgment that such losses result from the willful
misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives,
and pending any such judgment, Parent shall promptly pay (and advance all
expenses in connection with) all such indemnification claims.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(l) If the Term Facility, Bridge Facility and/or Debt Securities (each as
defined in the Financing Commitments) have all funded (or all conditions to
funding have been satisfied other than filing the appropriate merger
certificates with the Louisiana and Delaware secretaries of state and
consummation of the Merger) on or prior to the Closing Date and Parent has
insufficient cash on hand and/or availability under the Revolving Facility or
Replacement Revolving Facility (as defined in the Financing Commitments) to
finance the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, the Proposed
Refinancing and related fees, expenses, accrued interest and premiums, such
event shall constitute a "knowing and intentional breach" of this Agreement.

  

  

(m) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that neither the receipt of
the Financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Alternative
Financing), nor the completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by
the Financing, nor the availability of cash at the Company to be used to
consummate the Transactions, is a condition to the Closing.

  

  

SECTION 6.09 Further Action. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with the other parties
and use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their
respective reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or
advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as
practicable (and in any event no later than the Extended Outside Date) and to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notifications, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents, (ii) obtain promptly (and in any event no later than the
Extended Outside Date) all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and
other confirmations from any Governmental Authority necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Transactions, (iii) defend any Action by a
Governmental Authority or third party challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions and (iv) obtain all material consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties necessary to consummate the Merger;
provided that the Company shall not be required to make any payments or offer
or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) as a condition to the
procurement of any such third-party consent, approval or waiver.

  

  

(b) Each party hereto agrees to (1) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions within fourteen (14) Business Days of the date of this Agreement,
and (2) supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Subject to the limitation in Section 6.09(d), Parent agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required authorizations, as
applicable, under the HSR Act, including but not limited to: (i) selling or
otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise
dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating, entering into or
modifying existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any
joint venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to
enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file
appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in connection with
any of the foregoing) (each a "Divestiture Action") in an effort to ensure
that no Governmental Authority enters any order, decision, judgment, decree,
ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law, rule,
regulation or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining
or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger. Parent may condition the entry
of a Divestiture Action on consummation of the Merger. Subject to the
limitation in Section 6.09(d), in the event a Governmental Authority
institutes (or threatens to institute) any action challenging the Transactions
as violative of any Antitrust Law, Parent and the Company shall cooperate and
use reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such Action,
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the
Merger or any other Transactions, including by pursuing administrative or
judicial appeal, and Parent shall take all action necessary, including but not
limited to any Divestiture Action, in an effort to resolve such action so as
to permit such consummation be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in
any event no later than the Extended Outside Date). To assist Parent in
complying with its obligations set forth in this Section 6.09, at Parent's
request the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into one
or more agreements prior to the Closing with respect to any Divestiture
Action; provided, however, that the consummation of the transactions provided
for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action shall be conditioned upon
the Closing.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.09(b), in the event the
Company or Parent receives a Second Request in connection with the
Transactions, such party will comply with such Second Request as provided by
the HSR Act not more than ninety (90) days from the date of service of the
Second Request. For purposes of this provision, a party shall be deemed to
have complied with any such request by providing a response that the party in
good faith believes to be in substantial compliance notwithstanding any
Governmental Authority's ultimate refusal to certify substantial compliance
within the ninety (90) day period. In the event that a party receives a
subpoena or civil investigative demand requesting materials and information
similar to that usually demanded in a Second Request, such party shall comply
with such subpoena or civil investigative demand not more than ninety (90)
days from the date of service of the subpoena or civil investigative demand.
In the event the Governmental Authority disputes the adequacy of compliance by
a party with respect to a Second Request, subpoena, or civil investigative
demand, the party shall endeavor to satisfy the Governmental Authority so as
to minimize any delay in the conduct or resolution of the investigation. For
purposes of determining the Additional Per Share Consideration (if any), the
number of days included in the Ticking Fee Period shall be reduced by one day
for each day following the later of (i) the sixtieth (60th) day from the date
of service of the Second Request and (ii) the date on which Parent, but not
the Company, has certified substantial compliance with a Second Request until,
in each case, the day on which the Company certifies substantial compliance
with such Second Request.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to agree to any Divestiture
Action(s) where such Divestiture Action(s), collectively, would result in a
loss of EBITDA generated by Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, collectively, in excess of $60.0 million based on the EBITDA
calculations set forth in Schedule 6.09(d); provided, however, that any sale
or other disposal, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise
dispose, of assets required to comply with Wisconsin Statutes §§ 157.067(2)
and 445.12(6) shall be disregarded for purposes of determining any loss of
EBITDA pursuant to this Section 6.09(d); provided further that nothing herein
shall relieve Parent of its obligations under Section 8.03. Parent agrees to
sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate and agree to sell or otherwise
dispose of, such assets of Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, to ensure compliance with such Wisconsin Statutes so as to
enable the Closing to occur as promptly as reasonably practicable and in no
event later than the Extended Outside Date; provided, however, that the
consummation of any such sale or other disposal or hold separate shall be
conditioned upon the Closing. To assist Parent in complying with its
obligations set forth in this Section 6.09(d), at Parent's request the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more agreements
prior to the Closing with respect to any such sale or other disposal or hold
separate; provided, however, that the consummation of any such sale or other
disposal or hold separate shall be conditioned upon the Closing.

  

  

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, but Parent may, if in its good
faith judgment it determines (after consulting in advance with the Company and
in good faith taking the Company's views into account) that the taking of such
action would enhance the likelihood of obtaining any necessary antitrust,
competition, fair trade or similar clearance by the Outside Date or the
Extended Outside Date, as applicable, enter into an agreement with a
Governmental Authority not to consummate the Transactions or agree to withdraw
and refile under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law.

  

  

(f) Each of the Company and Parent shall, in connection with the Transactions,
with respect to actions taken on or after the date of this Agreement, without
limitation: (i) promptly notify the other of, and if in writing, furnish the
other with copies of any communications from or with any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions; (ii) permit the other to review
and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the view of the other in
connection with, any proposed written or oral communication with any
Governmental Authority; (iii) not participate in any substantive meeting or
have any substantive communication with any Governmental Authority unless it
has given the other party a reasonable opportunity to consult with it in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the
other the opportunity to attend and participate therein; (iv) furnish the
other party's outside legal counsel with copies of all filings and
communications between it and any such Governmental Authority with respect to
the Transactions; provided, however, that such material may be redacted as
necessary to (A) comply with contractual arrangements, (B) address legal
privilege or confidentiality concerns and (C) comply with applicable Law; and
(v) furnish the other party's outside legal counsel with such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other party's outside legal
counsel may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary
submissions of information to any such Governmental Authority.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

The Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this Section 6.09 as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material". Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust
counsel of the recipient and designated in house counsel of Parent approved by
the Company and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel or in-house
counsel to directors, officers, other employees, potential Financing Sources
or other Representatives of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent as
the case may be) or its outside legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 6.09, materials provided to the other party or its
outside legal counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries or as regards Parent's plans for
conducting its business or that of the Company and its Subsidiaries after
consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

(g) In the event of any Action by a Governmental Authority or other third
party challenging the Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to respond to and contest and resist any such Action and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Transactions prior to the Extended Outside Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.09, with respect to
Antitrust Laws, Parent shall be entitled to direct and control all
communications, strategy and defense of the Transactions in any Action by, or
negotiations with, any Governmental Authority or other Person relating to the
Transactions or regulatory filings. For avoidance of doubt, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make any offer, acceptance or
counter-offer or otherwise engage in negotiations or discussions with any
Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to any Divestiture Action
required to permit the consummation of the Transactions by the Extended
Outside Date or any sale or other disposal or hold separate required to comply
with Wisconsin Statutes §§ 157.067(2) and 445.12(6), except in either case as
required by the Governmental Authority or as specifically requested by or
agreed with Parent. Nothing herein shall relieve Parent of its obligations
under Section 6.09(f).

  

  

(h) Each of the Company and Parent shall not, and shall not permit their
respective Affiliates to, take any action or enter into any transaction, the
effect of which is to impair, delay or prevent any required approvals, or
expiration of the waiting period, under the Antitrust Laws.

  

  

SECTION 6.10 Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.11 Subsequent Financial Statements. The Company shall, if
practicable, provide Parent copies of its financial results for any period
after the date of this Agreement prior to making publicly available such
financial results and prior to filing any report or document with the SEC
after the date of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 6.12 Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any applicable
national securities exchange or any national securities quotation system, and
subject to the parties' obligations under Section 6.09, each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other, and
shall reasonably consider all additions, deletions or changes suggested by the
other party in connection therewith, before issuing any press release or
public statement with respect to this Agreement or any of the Transactions.
Nothing in this Section 6.12 shall affect the rights of the Company to make
disclosures and communications permitted by Section 6.04.

  

  

SECTION 6.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to approve in advance in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each
officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act (or who will become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as
a result of the Transactions) with respect to equity securities of the
Company.

  

  

SECTION 6.14 Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Company's operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

  

  

SECTION 6.15 Affiliate Transactions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to terminate, and shall cause to be
terminated, each Affiliate Transaction, except for (a) the Affiliate
Transactions listed in Section 6.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (b)
any Affiliate Transactions that will automatically terminate in accordance
with their terms upon consummation of the Merger, in each case without any
further liability or obligation of the Company or the Surviving Corporation
and, in connection therewith, the Company (or its applicable Subsidiary) shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the other party or parties
to each such Affiliate Transaction a release in favor of the Company and its
Affiliates from any and all liabilities or obligations arising out of such
Affiliate Transaction.

  

  

SECTION 6.16 Termination of Trading and Deregistration. Immediately prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws to cause the trading in Company Common Stock on the NASDAQ to
be terminated, and to enable the deregistration of the Company Common Stock
under the Exchange Act, in each case as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

  

  

SECTION 6.17 Shareholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent (subject to
a customary joint defense agreement) the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company or any
of its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
whether commenced prior to or after the date hereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall not (a)
settle or offer to settle any such litigation, (b) indemnify any Person
against any costs, expenses, judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any such litigation, or provide to any
Person advancement of expenses in connection with any such litigation, in each
case except as required by the Governing Documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, in any case, in effect as of the date hereof, or (c)
authorize, commit or agree to take any of the actions described in either of
the foregoing clauses (a) or (b).

  

  

SECTION 6.18 Takeover Laws. The Company, acting through the Company Board,
shall (a) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no Takeover Law (other
than LBCL Sections 92(G) and 130-130.2) is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement or the Transactions, including the receipt of the Merger
Consideration by the shareholders of the Company, and (b) if any Takeover Law
becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions, use reasonable best
efforts to take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement
and the Transactions.

  

  

ARTICLE VII

  

  

CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

  

  

SECTION 7.01 Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party. The obligations of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to the

SECTION 8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by
action taken or authorized by the board of directors of the terminating party,
notwithstanding any requisite approval of this Agreement and the Transactions
by the shareholders of the Company, as follows:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company; or

  

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company if:

  

  

 

     |  

(i)

  |  

the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before December 30, 2013 (the
"Outside Date"); provided, however, that if on the Outside Date all of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.01, Section 7.02 and Section 7.03 have been
satisfied (or, with respect to the conditions that by their terms must be
satisfied at the Closing would have been so satisfied if the Closing would
have occurred) other than the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b) (to the
extent such Restraint arises under any Antitrust Law and shall not have become
final and nonappealable) or Section 7.01(c), then either Parent or the Company
may extend the Outside Date for an additional sixty (60) days (as extended,
the "Extended Outside Date") by delivery of written notice of such extension
to the other party not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside
Date if the party delivering such notice reasonably believes that the
conditions in Sections 7.01(b) and 7.01(c) are reasonably likely to be
satisfied on or before the Extended Outside Date; provided, further, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be
available to any party whose knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement
has been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective
Time to occur on or before the Outside Date or the Extended Outside Date, as
applicable;

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(ii)

  |  

any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 7.01(b) hereof shall have
become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)(ii) shall have complied in
all material respects with its obligations under Section 6.09; or

   
---|---|---

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) by Parent:

  

  

 

     |  

(i)

  |  

upon a breach by the Company of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement such that a condition set forth in
Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b) would not be satisfied and such breach
cannot be cured or has not been cured within fifteen (15) days of the receipt
by the Company of written notice thereof from Parent (and in any event prior
to the Outside Date or the Extended Outside Date, as applicable); provided,
however, that, Parent or Merger Sub shall not then be in material breach of
this Agreement; or

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(ii)

  |  

in the event an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred; or

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(iii)

  |  

the Company shall have knowingly and intentionally breached in any material
respect its obligations under Section 6.01(b), Section 6.02 or Section 6.04;
or.

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

(d) by the Company:

  

  

 

     |  

(i)

  |  

upon a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement such that a condition set
forth in Section 7.03(a) or Section 7.03(b) would not be satisfied and such
breach cannot be cured or has not been cured within fifteen (15) days of the
receipt by Parent of written notice thereof from the Company (and in any event
prior to the Outside Date or the Extended Outside Date, as applicable);
provided, however, that, the Company shall not then be in material breach of
this Agreement;

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(ii)

  |  

at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Approval, in order to enter into
any Superior Proposal Agreement, if the Company has complied in all material
respects with its obligations under Section 6.04(d); provided, however, that
any such purported termination by the Company pursuant to this Section
8.01(d)(ii) shall be void and of no force or effect unless the Company prior
to or concurrently with such termination pays to Parent the Termination Fee in
accordance with Section 8.03(b)(iv); or

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(iii)

  |  

if (A) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) have
been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived in
accordance with this Agreement, (B) the Company has indicated by written
notice to Parent and Merger Sub that the Company is ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing and (C) Parent and Merger Sub shall have failed to
consummate the Closing by the day that is (1) ten (10) Business Days following

complied in all material respects with its obligations in Section 6.08, but
the Financing Sources fail to fund in accordance with the terms of the
Financing Commitments all or a portion of the funds necessary to consummate
the Merger, thirty (30) days following the delivery of such notice by the
Company.

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 8.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void, and there shall be no liability under this Agreement on the part of any
party hereto, except (a) as set forth in Section 6.03(b) and Parent's
obligations to pay Expenses and provide the indemnification set forth in
Section 6.08, (b) the provisions of Section 8.02 and Section 8.03 and of
Article IX shall survive any such termination of this Agreement and (c)
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for fraud or, except as
set forth in Section 8.03, knowing and intentional breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement prior to such termination. For avoidance of doubt, breach of the
Voting Agreement by one or more of the Shareholders named therein shall not
constitute a breach by the Company of this Agreement. A breach of the Voting
Agreement by one or more of the Shareholders named therein shall not permit
Parent to terminate this Agreement or excuse performance by Parent and Merger
Sub of their obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 8.03 Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.08 and
this Section 8.03, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether

in this Agreement, shall include all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including all fees and expenses of legal counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, Financing Sources, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its
Affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related
to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement, the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy
Statement, the solicitation of shareholder approvals, the filing of any
required notices under any Antitrust Law, the financing of all or a portion of
the Merger Consideration or the Proposed Refinancing and all other matters
related to the consummation of the Transactions.

  

  

(b) The Company agrees that, if:

  

  

 

     |  

(i)

  |  

(A) after the date of this Agreement, any bona fide Significant Competing
Transaction shall have been publicly announced and not withdrawn prior to the
Company Shareholders' Meeting and this Agreement is terminated by Parent or
the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section
8.01(c)(i) and (B) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months after such
termination, any definitive agreement providing for such Significant Competing
Transaction shall have been entered into by the Company or such Significant
Competing Transaction shall have been consummated, then the Company shall pay
to Parent a fee equal to $27.5 million (the "Termination Fee") (less any
amounts already paid by the Company pursuant to Section 8.03(b)(ii)), which
amount shall be payable in immediately available funds, upon the earlier of
consummation of the Significant Competing Transaction or the date on which the
Company enters into the agreement providing for such Significant Competing
Transaction, as applicable; provided, however, that nothing in this Section
8.03(b)(i) shall preclude Parent from recovering the Termination Fee pursuant
to Section 8.03(b)(iii) in the event it becomes due and payable as
contemplated therein;

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(ii)

  |  

if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii) and
neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in material breach of its material covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement or its representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, then the Company shall reimburse
Parent for documented Expenses up to a maximum of $10.0 million , in
immediately available funds, within one (1) Business Day after submission by
Parent of statements therefor, it being understood that such reimbursement
shall not preclude Parent from recovering the Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.03(b)(i) or Section 8.03(b)(iii) in the event it becomes due and
payable as contemplated therein, provided that any amount paid by the Company
pursuant to this Section 8.01(b)(ii) shall be offset against any Termination
Fee;

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(iii)

  |  

this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii) or
8.01(c)(iii), then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee in
immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days of the date of such
termination; or

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(iv)

  |  

this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii),
then the Company shall pay to Parent prior to or concurrently with such
termination the Termination Fee in immediately available funds.

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

Parent agrees that in no event shall Parent be entitled to receive more than
one Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 8.03(b) and in the event
that the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee, the Company shall have no
further liability to Parent or Merger Sub arising out of the termination of
this Agreement, except in the case of fraud.

  


 

  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub agree that in the event that

  

  

 

     |  

(i)

  |  

(A) this Agreement has been terminated by either the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) and (B) the condition set forth in Section
7.01(b) or Section 7.01(c) has not been satisfied as of the date of such
termination (other than as a result of any knowing and intentional breach of
this Agreement by the Company) but all other conditions to the Merger set
forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 shall otherwise have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but which conditions would have been satisfied if the Closing Date
were the date of such termination);

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(ii)

  |  

(A) this Agreement has been terminated by either the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii) and (B) the condition set forth in Section
7.01(b) or Section 7.01(c) has not been satisfied as of the date of such
termination (other than as a result of any knowing and intentional breach of
this Agreement by the Company) but all other conditions to the Merger set
forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 that are capable of being satisfied as
of such date shall otherwise have been satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but which conditions
would have been satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such
termination); or

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

     |  

(iii)

  |  

the Company has terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(iii);

   
---|---|--- 
 

 

  

  

then, in any such case, Parent shall pay to the Company a fee equal to up to
$75.0 million, of which $50.0 million shall be paid concurrently with such
termination (in the case of a termination by Parent) or within two (2)
Business Days following such termination (in the case of a termination by the
Company) and an additional $25.0 million shall be payable when and if required
by Section 8.03(d) (collectively, the "Parent Termination Fee"), which amounts
shall be payable in immediately available funds.

  

  

(d) In the event the Parent Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section
8.03(c), the Company shall, within sixty (60) days from the date this
Agreement is terminated, elect (by written notice to Parent) to either (i)
accept the remaining $25.0 million of the Parent Termination Fee in full
satisfaction of its rights under this Agreement, or (ii) pursue its other
rights or remedies under law or at equity, including specific performance and
damages arising out of knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement by
Parent and/or Merger Sub. In the event the Company elects to accept remaining
$25.0 million of the Parent Termination Fee (or fails to make a timely
election, in which case it will be deemed to have accepted the remaining $25.0
million of the Parent Termination Fee), Parent shall promptly pay to the
Company the remaining $25.0 million of the Parent Termination Fee against
receipt from the Company of an appropriate release of claims under this
Agreement, in which case Parent and Merger Sub shall have no further liability
to the Company arising out of this Agreement. In the event the Company elects
to pursue its other rights or remedies under law or at equity, Parent and the
Company shall enter into a customary escrow agreement with a nationally
recognized, mutually agreed upon escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") and Parent
shall deposit an amount equal to $25.0 million with the Escrow Agent, to be
held in trust, until the parties give joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent as to the disbursement of such amount or until receipt by the Escrow
Agent of a final and non-appealable judgment (including dismissal) from a
court of competent jurisdiction. If such judgment is (A) a dismissal, then the
Escrow Agent shall release to Parent the full amount in escrow and Parent and
Merger Sub shall have no further liability to the Company arising out of this
Agreement or (B) an award for damages to the Company, then the Escrow Agent
shall release to the Company (1) if the award is greater than or equal to the
Parent Termination Fee, the full amount in escrow or (2) if the award is less
than the Parent Termination Fee, an amount equal to such award (less the $50.0
million previously paid to the Company, it being understood that the Company
shall not be required to return to Parent any of the $50.0 million previously
paid by Parent), with the balance of the amount in escrow released to Parent.
To the extent the amount of the award for damages to the Company exceeds the
aggregate amount of the Parent Termination Fee, Parent shall pay to the
Company, in immediately available funds, the amount of such excess in
accordance with the terms of such judgment. The Company agrees that in no
event shall the Company be entitled to receive more than one Parent
Termination Fee. The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be borne
equally by Parent and the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.08
and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under Section 8.03(c) and
Section 8.03(d); provided that in no event shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in a
Closing and the Parent Termination Fee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.03 are an integral part of this Agreement and the Transactions. In
the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or any Parent
Expenses when due or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee or
any Company Expenses pursuant to Section 6.08 when due, the non-breaching
party shall be entitled to recover the costs and expenses actually incurred or
accrued by such non-breaching party (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel), as applicable, in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 8.03, together with interest on such unpaid fee
and Expenses at the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition, commencing on the date that such fee or such Expenses became due.

  

  

SECTION 8.04 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, Sections 8.02, 8.04, 8.05, 9.06,
9.07, 9.11 and 9.12 (in each case, together with any related definitions and
other provisions of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification,
termination or waiver thereof would serve to modify the substance or
provisions of such Sections) may not be amended, modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that is adverse to any Financing Source without the
prior written consent of each Financing Source; provided, further, that, after
the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions by the shareholders of the
Company, no amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement may (a) alter or change the amount or kind of shares,
securities, cash, property and/or rights to be received in exchange for or on
conversion of all or any of the Shares, (b) alter or change any term of the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation to be effected by the
Merger or (c) alter or change any of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement if such alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of the Company. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

  

  

SECTION 8.05 Waiver. Subject to the provisos in Section 8.04, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of any other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and/or (c) waive
compliance with any agreement of any other party or any condition to its own
obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby.

8.02, 8.04, 8.05, 9.06, 9.07, 9.11 and 9.12, which are intended to be for the
benefit of each Financing Source and may be enforced by such persons. By way
of amplification and not limitation, and notwithstanding Section 9.08(b), it
is agreed that neither this provision nor any other provision in this
Agreement shall provide any of the Company's shareholders (or any party acting
on their behalf) the ability to seek (whether in its capacity as a shareholder
or purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the
Company) prior to the Effective Time the enforcement of, or directly seek any
remedies pursuant to, this Agreement, or otherwise create prior to the
Effective Time any rights in the Company's shareholders under this Agreement
or otherwise, including against the Company or its directors, officers, agents
or advisors, under any theory of Law or equity, including under the applicable
Laws of agency or the Laws relating to the rights and obligations of third-
party beneficiaries. For avoidance of doubt as to the parties' intent, the
determination of whether and how to terminate, amend, make any waiver or
consent under, or enforce this Agreement prior to the Effective Time, and
whether and how (if applicable) to distribute any damages award to the Company
prior to the Effective Time, shall exclusively belong to the Company (acting
expressly through its board of directors) in its sole discretion.

SECTION 9.07 Governing Law; Exclusive Forum. This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State (other
than those provisions set forth herein that are required to be governed by the
LBCL). All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, in the event
(but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such Action, in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware. The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, in the event (but only in
the event) that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such
Action, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of
motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or
that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of
the above-named courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that (i) it will not
bring or support any Person in bringing, and will not permit any of its
Affiliates to bring or support any Person in bringing, any Action involving
any Financing Source or any of its Representatives arising out of or relating
to the Transactions, the Financing, this Agreement, the Financing Letter, the
accompanying fee letter or any definitive agreement in respect of the
Financing or the performance hereof and thereof in any forum other than the
Delaware Court of Chancery or, in the event (but only in the event) that such
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such Action, the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware and (ii) the provisions of
Section 9.11 relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such
Action.

  

  

SECTION 9.08 Specific Performance; Damages.

  

  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the
parties acknowledge and agree (and further agree not to take any contrary
position in any litigation concerning this Agreement) that (i) the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or
other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including the obligations of the
parties hereto to consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 1.02)
without proof of damages or otherwise, and that such relief may be sought in
addition to and shall not limit, diminish, or otherwise impair, any other
remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) except as
specifically set forth in Section 8.03, the provisions set forth in Section
8.03 shall not be construed to limit, diminish or otherwise impair in any
respect any party's right to specific enforcement and (iii) the right of
specific enforcement is the remedy preferred by the parties, is an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and without that
right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the
Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with enforcing Parent's obligation to consummate the
Merger shall be subject to the requirements that (A) all conditions in Section
7.01 and 7.02 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at Closing) at the time when the
Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 1.02, (B) the Financing has
been funded in accordance with the terms of the Financing Letter (or any
Alternative Financing) or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof
at the Closing, and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if the
Financing is funded, then it would take such actions that are within its
control to cause the Closing to occur. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that (1) the other parties hereto have an
adequate remedy at Law or (2) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.08 shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that in the event of any knowing and intentional breach of this
Agreement (i) by Parent or Merger Sub, the damages incurred by the Company for
purposes of determining any remedy at law or equity available to the Company
under this Agreement could include, to the extent proven, the damages incurred
by the Company's shareholders as a result of such shareholders' failure to
receive the benefit of the consideration negotiated by the Company on their
behalf as set forth in this Agreement or (ii) by the Company resulting in the
non-consummation of the Merger, the damages incurred by Parent for purposes of
determining any remedy at law or equity available to Parent under this
Agreement could include, to the extent proven, damages based on the synergies
and other benefits that would have accrued to Parent as a result of the
Merger. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final,
non-appealable judgment that a knowing and intentional breach of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub caused the failure of the Merger to be
consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the parties agree
that the minimum amount of damages incurred by the Company under this
Agreement shall be $100.0 million (which amount shall be reduced by any
amounts paid to the Company pursuant to Sections 8.03(c) and (d)).
