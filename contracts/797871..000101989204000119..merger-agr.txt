be issued pursuant to Section 2.4 and Section 2.9(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of FLBK Common Stock, and (ii) the cash in lieu of
fractional shares to be paid in accordance with Section 2.9(e) hereof.
Such cash and certificates for shares of TSFG Common Stock, together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred
to as the "Exchange Fund."   2.9 Exchange of Shares.   (a) As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event within five (5)
business days after the Effective Time, or otherwise as may be agreed upon by
the parties, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of FLBK
Stock Certificates at the Effective Time, a form letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the FLBK Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the FLBK Stock
Certificates, to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the FLBK Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. FLBK shall have the right to review both the letter
of transmittal and the instructions prior to the Effective Time and
provide reasonable comments thereon. Upon surrender of FLBK Stock
Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with a properly executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such FLBK Stock
Certificates shall   6   be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x)
a certificate representing that number of whole shares of TSFG Common Stock
which such holder of FLBK Common Stock became entitled to receive pursuant to
the provisions of Article II hereof and (y) a check representing the amount
of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, which such holder has the right
to receive in respect of the FLBK Stock Certificates, as provided in Section
2.9(e), and the FLBK Stock Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of
fractional shares or the unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable
to holders of FLBK Stock Certificates.   (b) No dividends or other
distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to TSFG Common
Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered FLBK Stock Certificate until the holder thereof
shall surrender such FLBK Stock Certificate in accordance with this Article
II. After the surrender of a FLBK Stock Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of TSFG Common Stock
represented by such FLBK Stock Certificate.   (c) If any certificate
representing shares of TSFG Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than
that in which the FLBK Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the FLBK
Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied
by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a certificate representing shares of TSFG Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the FLBK Stock Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or
is not payable.   (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of FLBK of the shares of FLBK Common Stock which
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, FLBK Stock Certificates representing such shares
are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for certificates representing shares of TSFG Common Stock, as
provided in this Article II.   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
TSFG Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of FLBK
Stock Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to TSFG Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of TSFG. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, TSFG shall pay to each former shareholder of FLBK who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of TSFG Common
Stock an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the Fair Market Value
by (ii) the fraction of a share of TSFG Common Stock which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof.   (f) Any
portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of
FLBK for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be paid to TSFG. Any
shareholders of FLBK who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to TSFG for payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration and/or the unpaid dividends and distributions on the
TSFG Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of FLBK Common Stock
such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each
case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
TSFG, FLBK, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of FLBK Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.   (g) In the event any FLBK Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such FLBK Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the
Exchange Agent may direct   7   as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such FLBK Stock Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed FLBK Stock
Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.   2.10 [Reserved].   2.11 Stock-Based
Plans.   (a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by FLBK under any
of the FLBK Stock-Based Plans, which is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior thereto, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of FLBK Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a fully-vested
option to purchase shares of TSFG Common Stock in an amount and at an
exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the
terms of the applicable FLBK Stock-Based Plan, the agreements evidencing
grants thereunder, and any other agreements between FLBK and an optionee
regarding FLBK options):   (1) the number of shares of TSFG Common Stock to
be subject to the new option shall be equal to the product of the number of
shares of FLBK Common Stock subject to the original option and the Exchange
Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of TSFG Common Stock resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest whole share (and .5
of a share shall be rounded up), and   (2) the exercise price per share of
TSFG Common Stock under the new option shall be equal to the exercise price
per share of FLBK Common Stock under the original option divided by the
Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded to the
nearest cent (and .5 of a cent shall be rounded up).   (b) At the Effective

respectively.   3.2 Standards. No representation or warranty of FLBK

FLBK provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with TSFG for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement
to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but
not for accrual of defined benefit pension benefits); provided however, that
such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition limitations.
Each TSFG Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same
extent waived under the applicable FLBK Plan. FLBK\'s employees shall be
given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the
same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the TSFG Plan.   (c) As of the Effective Time, TSFG
shall assume and honor and shall cause the appropriate Subsidiaries of TSFG
to assume and to honor in accordance with their terms all written agreements
listed in Section 4.13(a) of the FLBK Disclosure Schedule (the "Benefit
Agreements"). TSFG acknowledges and agrees that the Merger will constitute a
merger, sale or a change in control of FLBK for all purposes under such
agreements. The provisions of this Section 7.8(c) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director, officer or employee
that is a party to any Benefit Agreement.   (d) TSFG hereby acknowledges
that in connection with the Merger it will succeed to all the rights and
obligations of FLBK under the employment agreements set forth on Section 4.13
of the FLBK Disclosure Schedule.   7.9 Indemnification of FLBK Directors and
Officers. TSFG or a TSFG Subsidiary shall provide and keep in force for a
period of six years after the Effective Time directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance providing coverage to directors and officers of FLBK for
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time. Such insurance shall
provide at least the same coverage and amounts as contained in FLBK\'s policy
on the date hereof; provided, that in no event shall the annual premium on
such policy exceed 200% of the annual premium payments on FLBK\'s policy in
effect as of December 31, 2003 (the "Maximum Amount"). If the amount of the
premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, TSFG shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
most advantageous policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount and FLBK shall cooperate
with TSFG in such efforts in all reasonable respects. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, TSFG further agrees to indemnify all individuals who are or have
been officers, directors or employees of FLBK prior to the Effective Time
from any acts or omissions in such capacities prior to the Effective Time, to
the extent that such indemnification is provided pursuant to the Articles of
Incorporation or Bylaws of FLBK on the date hereof and is permitted under the
FBCA and SCBCA.   7.10 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of
each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by TSFG or FLBK.   24    7.11 Appointment of
Director. Effective as of the Effective Time, TSFG shall cause its Board of
Directors to be expanded by one member, and shall appoint a current director
of FLBK (selected by a majority of FLBK\'s directors) (the "FLBK Director")
to fill the vacancy created by such increase.   7.12 Bank Board. For at
least three years following Closing, TSFG shall cause each individual who is
currently serving as a director of FLBK (other than the FLBK Director), if
such persons are willing to so serve, to be elected or appointed as
Mercantile Bank Board members and/or advisory board members.   7.13
Accounting Matters. FLBK shall cooperate with TSFG concerning (i) accounting
and financial matters necessary or appropriate to facilitate the Merger
(taking into account TSFG\'s policies, practices and procedures), including,
without limitation, issues arising in connection with record keeping, loan
classification, valuation adjustments, levels of loan loss reserves and other
accounting practices, and (ii) FLBK\'s lending, investment or asset/liability
management policies; provided, that any action taken pursuant to this Section
7.13 shall not be deemed to constitute or result in the breach of any
representation or warranty of FLBK contained in this Agreement.   7.14 Tax
Opinion. TSFG and FLBK shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain the tax opinion contemplated by Section 8.1(f).   7.15 Exemption from
Section 16. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of TSFG, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
acquisition by any officer or director of FLBK who may become a covered
person of TSFG for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder ("Section 16") of TSFG Common Stock or options to
acquire TSFG Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be
an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.   7.16 Execution and
Authorization of Bank Merger Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof, (a) TSFG shall (i) cause the Board of Directors of
Mercantile Bank to approve a transaction (structured in the discretion of
TSFG) in which all or the substantial portion of Florida Bank\'s assets and
liabilities will be transferred to Mercantile Bank via merger, asset sale or
otherwise (the "Bank Merger Agreement"), (ii) cause Mercantile Bank
to execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement, and (iii) approve the Bank
Merger Agreement as the sole shareholder of Mercantile Bank, and (b) FLBK
shall (i) cause the Board of Directors of Florida Bank to approve the Bank
Merger Agreement, (ii) cause Florida Bank to execute and deliver the Bank
Merger Agreement, and (iii) approve the Bank Merger Agreement as the sole
shareholder of Florida Bank.   7.17 Employment Agreements. TSFG and FLBK
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to facilitate the
execution of employment agreements between TSFG and the individuals listed in
Section 7.17 of the TSFG Disclosure Schedule.    ARTICLE VIII  CONDITIONS

prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters

by mutual consent of FLBK and TSFG in a written instrument, if the Board of
Directors of each so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its
entire Board;   (b) by either TSFG or FLBK upon written notice to the other
party (i) 30 days after the date on which any request or application for a

request or recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such
Requisite Regulatory Approval, unless within the 30-day period following such
denial or withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended application has
been filed with the applicable Governmental Entity, provided, however, that
no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(b)(i) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein or (ii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger;   (c) by either TSFG or FLBK if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before December 31, 2004, unless the failure of the
Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;   (d) by either TSFG or FLBK if
the approval of the shareholders of FLBK required for the consummation of the
Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the
required vote at a duly held meeting of such shareholders or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof;   27    (e) by either TSFG or FLBK
(provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if
there shall have been a material breach of any of the representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other party, which
breach is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the party
committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior
to the Closing; provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e) unless the breach of
representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would
entitle the party receiving such representation not to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 8.2(a) (in the case of a
breach of representation or warranty by FLBK) or Section 8.3(a) (in the case
of a breach of representation or warranty by TSFG);   (f) by either TSFG or
FLBK (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein)
if there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other party, which
breach shall not have been cured within 30 days following receipt by the
breaching party of written notice of such breach from the other party hereto,
or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing;   (g)
by FLBK, in the event that the Board of Directors of FLBK determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that in light of a Superior
Proposal it is necessary to terminate this Agreement in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties to FLBK and to FLBK\'s shareholders under applicable
law; provided, however, that the Board of Directors of FLBK may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) solely in order
to concurrently enter into a letter of intent, agreement in principle or
an acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement") related to a Superior Proposal; provided further,
however, that this Agreement may be terminated pursuant to this Section
9.1(g) only after the fifth day following TSFG\'s receipt of written notice
advising TSFG that the Board of Directors of FLBK is prepared to accept a
Superior Proposal, and only if, during such five-day period, if TSFG so
elects, FLBK and its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith with TSFG
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would enable FLBK to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein on
such adjusted terms; or   (h) by FLBK at any time during the three-business
day period following the Determination Date, if both of the following
conditions are satisfied:   (1) the Fair Market Value shall be less than
the product of 0.85 and the Starting Price; and   (2) (i) the number
obtained by dividing the Fair Market Value by the Starting Price (such number
being referred to herein as the "TSFG Ratio") shall be less than (ii) the
number obtained by dividing the Index Price on the Determination Date by the
Index Price on the Starting Date and subtracting 0.10 from such quotient
(such number being referred to herein as the "Index Ratio");  subject to the
following. If FLBK elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt written notice to TSFG;
provided that such notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn at any
time within the aforementioned three-day period. During the three-day period
commencing with its receipt of such notice, TSFG shall have the option of
increasing the Exchange Ratio in a manner such that the conditions set forth
in either clauses (1) or (2) above shall be deemed not to exist. For purposes
hereof, the condition set forth in (1) above shall be deemed not to exist if
the Exchange Ratio is increased so that the Per Share Merger Consideration
(valued based on the Fair Market Value) after such increase is equal to or
greater than the product of .85 and the Starting Price. For purposes hereof,
the condition set forth in clause (2) above shall be deemed not to exist if
the Exchange Ratio is increased so that the number obtained by dividing
Per Share Merger Consideration (valued based on the Fair Market Value) by
the Starting Price is equal to or greater than the Index Ratio. If TSFG makes
this election, within such three-day period, it shall give prompt written
notice to FLBK of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 9.1(h) and this
Agreement shall   28   remain in effect in accordance with its terms
(except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified), and any
references in this Agreement to "Per Share Merger Consideration" shall
thereafter be deemed to refer to the shares of TSFG common stock issuable
pursuant to the revised Exchange Ratio after giving effect to any adjustment
made pursuant to this Section 9.1(h).  If TSFG declares or effects a stock
dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange
of shares or similar transaction between the Starting Date and the
Determination Date, the prices for the common stock of TSFG shall be
appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 9.1(h).  
9.2 Effect of Termination.   (a) In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either TSFG or FLBK as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect except (i) Sections 7.2(b),
9.2 and 10.3 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising
out of its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.   (b) If FLBK
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g), FLBK shall pay to TSFG
a termination fee equal to $5 million (the "Termination Fee Amount" by wire
transfer of same day funds on the date of termination.   (c) In the event
that an Acquisition Proposal with respect to FLBK shall have been made known
to FLBK and shall have been publicly announced or otherwise become public, or
shall have been made to the shareholders of FLBK, and thereafter (x) this
Agreement is terminated by either TSFG or FLBK pursuant to either (i) Section
9.1(c) hereof and prior to such termination the stockholders of FLBK shall
not have previously approved the Merger, or (ii) Section 9.1(d) hereof as a
result of the failure of the stockholders of FLBK to approve the Merger, and
(y) within twelve months of such termination (A) FLBK enters into any
Acquisition Agreement providing for any transaction described in clause
(i)(a) or clause (i)(b) of the definition of "Superior Proposal," other than
any such transaction involving a merger, consolidation or similar transaction
as to which the common stockholders of FLBK immediately prior thereto own in
the aggregate more than 50% of the common stock of the surviving or
transferee corporation or its publicly-held parent corporation
immediately following consummation thereof, or (B) any person shall acquire
beneficial ownership of or the right to acquire 50% or more of the
outstanding shares of FLBK Common Stock, then upon the first occurrence of
either of the events contemplated by clause (y) FLBK shall pay TSFG a
termination fee equal to the Termination Fee Amount by wire transfer of same
day funds.   (d) FLBK agrees that the agreements contained in Section 9.2(b)
and 9.2(c) are integral parts of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty.   9.3
Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of
FLBK; provided, however, that after any approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by FLBK\'s shareholders, there may not be,
without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this
Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration
to be delivered to FLBK shareholders hereunder other than as contemplated by
this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.   29    9.4
Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by its Board of Directors, may,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.   ARTICLE X  GENERAL PROVISIONS   10.1
Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing
of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on the first

any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive
the Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements contained
herein and therein which by their terms apply in whole or in part after the
Effective Time provided that no such representations, warranties or covenants
shall be deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive TSFG or
FLBK (or any director, officer or controlling person thereof) of any defense
at law or in equity which otherwise would be available against the claims of
any third party, including, without limitation, any shareholder or former
shareholder of either TSFG or FLBK.   10.3 Expenses. All costs and expenses

EXHIBIT A  _________________, 2004   The South Financial Group, Inc. 102
S. Main Street Greenville, South Carolina 29601  Gentlemen:   I have been
advised that I might be considered to be an "affiliate" of Florida Banks,
Inc., a Florida corporation (the "Company"), for purposes of paragraphs (c)
and (d) of Rule 145 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").   The
South Financial Group, Inc., a South Carolina corporation ("TSFG") and the
Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March
17, 2004 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, the
Company will merge with and into TSFG (the "Transaction"). Upon
consummation of the Transaction, I will receive shares of common stock, $1.00
par value per share, of TSFG ("TSFG Common Stock"). This agreement is
hereinafter referred to as the "Letter Agreement."   A. I represent and
warrant to, and agree with, TSFG as follows:   1. I have read this Letter
Agreement and the Merger Agreement and have discussed their requirements and
other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, pledge, transfer or
otherwise dispose of shares of TSFG Common Stock, to the extent I felt
necessary, with my counsel or counsel for the Company.   2. I shall not
make any offer, sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition in violation of
the Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder of the shares of
TSFG Common Stock I receive pursuant to the Transaction.   B. I understand
and agree that:   1. I have been advised that any issuance of shares of TSFG
Common Stock to me pursuant to the Transaction will be registered with the
SEC. I have also been advised, however, that, because I may be an "affiliate"
of the Company at the time the Transaction will be submitted for a vote of
the shareholders of the Company and my disposition of such shares has not
been registered under the Act, I must hold such shares indefinitely unless
(i) such disposition of such shares is subject to an effective registration
statement and to the availability of a prospectus under the Act, (ii) a sale
of such shares is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under
the Act or (iii) in an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to TSFG, some other exemption from registration is available
with respect to any such proposed disposition of such shares.   2. Stop
transfer instructions will be given to the transfer agent of TSFG with
respect to the shares of TSFG Common Stock I receive pursuant to the
Transaction in connection with the restrictions set forth herein, and
there will be placed on the certificate representing shares of TSFG Common
Stock I receive pursuant to the Transaction, or any certificates delivered
in substitution therefor, a legend stating in substance:   "The shares
represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to which Rule
145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), applies and may
only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with   33   the
requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under
the Act or an exemption from such registration."   3. Unless a transfer of
my shares of TSFG Common Stock is a sale made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145(d), or made pursuant to an effective registration
