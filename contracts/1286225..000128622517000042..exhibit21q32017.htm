obligations and liabilities of the Company and any of its Affiliates related
thereto, as specified in the Debt Payoff Letters and in accordance with this
Agreement;

(iii) the Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered on behalf of the
Company, the amount payable to each Person who is owed a portion of the

Payoff Instructions and in accordance with this Agreement;

(iv) the Sellers shall deliver to Buyer the Purchased Assets and retain the

(v) the Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the a duly
executed Employment Agreement from each of Monte Jones and Scott Jones and the

Schedule 2.2(b)(vi);

(vii) each of the Sellers shall deliver a separate certificate of non-foreign
status in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer, satisfying
the requirements of § 1.1445-2(b)(2) of the United States Treasury Regulations
promulgated under the Code; 

(viii) the Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Buyer the

(x) the parties shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, the Transfer

(xi) the Buyer will deliver, or cause to be delivered, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a segregated client bank account maintained by
the Sellers Representative, on the Closing Date, an amount equal to the
Expense Fund Contribution (the "Expense Fund"), for the Sellers Representative
to hold on behalf of the Sellers as a fund which will be used for the purposes
of paying directly, or reimbursing the Sellers Representative for, any third
party expenses pursuant to this Agreement. For applicable Tax purposes, the
Expense Fund Contribution shall be treated in accordance with Section 2.5(f).

(c) All payments hereunder, including payments made pursuant to Section 2.4 or
8.5, shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds in United
States dollars to such account(s) as may be designated to the payor by Buyer
or the Sellers Representative, as applicable, at least two Business Days prior
to the applicable payment date.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the
Buyer's obligations hereunder (including the Buyer's obligation to pay the
Purchase Price), the Buyer shall be entitled at the Closing to direct that any
of the Purchased Assets be transferred by the Sellers to one or more of the
Buyer's Affiliates in lieu of any such transfer to the Buyer itself.

(e) Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall, pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, enter into,
and cause their respective Subsidiaries, if applicable, to enter into, on the
Closing Date, separate bills of sale and assignment and assumption agreements,
including patent, trademark, copyright, domain name and contract assignments
(collectively, the "Transfer Documents") documenting the purchase and sale of
each portion of the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities to be
conveyed separately to Buyer. Such individual Transfer Documents will
memorialize the transfer of the Purchased Assets to Buyer, Buyer's assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities, and Sellers' retention of the Excluded Assets and
Excluded Liabilities. The Transfer Documents shall be in substantially the
applicable forms attached hereto as Exhibits C-1 through C-4, with such
modifications as are necessary and appropriate as a result of differences in
local laws or customs, in order to maintain substantially the same legal
meaning and effect as provided for in this Agreement. In the event of any
conflict or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and any Transfer Document, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall
prevail. During the period from the effective date of this Agreement through
the Closing Date, if Buyer reasonably determines in good faith that any
Excluded Contracts or other Contracts should be Assumed Contracts or that all
or any portion of the Excluded Assets should be a Purchased Asset, then, at no
additional expense to Buyer, the Parties will amend the Schedules hereto to
reflect such changes and transfer such Contracts or assets, as applicable, to
Buyer as if such Contracts or assets had been a "Purchased Asset" as of the
date of this Agreement; provided, however, in no event shall (i) either of the
items listed at Item 12 and Item 13 on Schedule 2.1(b)(vi) be an Assumed
Contract or a Purchased Asset, (ii) either of the items listed at Items 1 and
2 on Schedule 2.1(b)(xi) be a Purchased Asset or (iii) the item listed at Item
2 on Schedule 2.1(b)(vii) be a Purchased Asset.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Assumed Contract if an
attempted assignment thereof, without consent of a third party thereto, would
constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or in any way adversely
affect the rights of Buyer thereunder. Sellers will use reasonable best
efforts (including payment of any reasonable third party costs) and Buyer will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Sellers to obtain the
consent of the other parties to any such 

Assumed Contract for the assignment thereof to Buyer; provided, however, that
neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall be obligated to pay any consideration
therefor to any third party from whom any such consent is requested and any
costs related to obtaining such consent shall be the sole responsibility of
Sellers. Unless and until such consent is obtained, or if an attempted
assignment thereof would be ineffective or would materially adversely affect
the rights of Sellers thereunder so that Buyer would not in fact receive all
rights and benefits under such Assumed Contract, then (i) such Seller shall
continue to be bound by such Assumed Contract and (ii) unless not permitted by
the terms thereof or applicable Law, Buyer shall, as agent or subcontractor
for such Seller, pay, perform and discharge fully, or cause to be paid,
transferred or discharged all the obligations or other Liabilities of such
Seller under such Assumed Contract arising solely after the Closing Date
(except to the extent expressly otherwise provided herein or in the Ancillary
Agreements). Such Seller shall, without further consideration, pay and remit,
or cause to be paid or remitted, to Buyer promptly all money, rights and other
consideration received by such Seller in respect of such performance. If and
when any such consent shall be obtained or such Assumed Contract shall
otherwise become assignable, such Seller shall promptly assign all of such
Seller's rights, obligations and other Liabilities under such Assumed Contract
to Buyer without receipt of further consideration, and Buyer shall, without
the payment of any further consideration, assume the rights, obligations and
other Liabilities under such Assumed Contract arising solely from and after
the Closing Date (except to the extent expressly otherwise provided herein or
in the Ancillary Agreements).

Section 2.3 Closing Estimates and Adjustments.

(a) At least three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Sellers Representative shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to
the Buyer a written statement (the "Preliminary Closing Statement") that shall
include and set forth a good-faith estimate of Net Working Capital (the
"Estimated Net Working Capital") (determined as of 11:59 p.m. on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date and without giving effect to the
transactions contemplated herein). Estimated Net Working Capital shall be
calculated in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
preparation of the April 2017 Balance Sheet (provided, that in the event of a
conflict between GAAP and consistent application thereof, GAAP shall prevail),
subject to such differences in accounting principles, policies and procedures
as are set forth on Exhibit B (GAAP as so modified pursuant to Exhibit B, the
"Applicable Accounting Principles"). All such estimates shall be subject to
the Buyer's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall
control solely for purposes of determining the amounts payable at the Closing
pursuant to Section 2.2 and shall not limit or otherwise affect the Buyer's
remedies under this Agreement or otherwise, or constitute an acknowledgement
by the Buyer of the accuracy of the amounts reflected thereof.

(b) In addition, to the extent the gross revenue reflected in the June 2017
Audited Schedule of Revenues (to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.10(b)) for
the period beginning July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2017 (the "Revenue True-
Up Period") is less than revenue reflected in the Interim Financial Statements
for the Revenue True-Up Period, which is $45,765,226, by 3% or more, the
Estimated Purchase Price will be reduced by an amount (the "Revenue True-Up
Amount") equal to (i) the gross revenue reflected in the Interim Financial
Statements for the Revenue True-Up Period minus the gross revenue reflected in
the June 2017 Audited Schedule of Revenues for the Revenue True-Up Period
multiplied by (ii) five. For this purpose, DepositIQ revenue will be excluded
in each of the June 2017 Audited Schedule of Revenues and the Interim
Financial Statements for the Revenue True-Up Period.

Section 2.4 Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price; Revenue True-Up Amount.

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and deliver to the Sellers Representative a written statement
(the "Initial Closing Statement") that shall include and set forth a
calculation of the actual Net Working Capital (the "Closing Net Working
Capital") (determined as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date and without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
herein). Closing Net Working Capital shall be calculated in accordance with
the Applicable Accounting Principles. If Buyer does not deliver the Initial
Closing Statement to the Sellers Representative within 90 days after the
Closing Date, then no downward adjustment to the Estimated Purchase Price
shall be permitted, no amounts shall be due to the Buyer pursuant to this
Section 2.4, and the Preliminary Closing Statement shall become final and
binding upon the parties hereto. 

(b) The Initial Closing Statement shall become final and binding (the "Final
Closing Statement") on the 30th day following delivery thereof unless, prior
to the end of such period, the Sellers Representative delivers to the Buyer
written notice of its disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") specifying the
nature and amount of any dispute as to the Closing Net Working Capital, as set
forth in the Initial Closing Statement. The Sellers Representative shall be
deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts of Closing Net Working
Capital not specifically referenced in the Notice of Disagreement, and such
items and amounts shall not be subject to review in accordance with Section
2.4(c). Any Notice of Disagreement may reference only disagreements based on
mathematical errors or based on amounts of the Closing Net Working Capital as
reflected on the Initial Closing Statement not being calculated in accordance
with this Section 2.4. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers Representative
shall be permitted to deliver only one Notice of Disagreement pursuant to this
Section 2.4(b).

(c) During the 15‑Business Day period following delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement by the Sellers Representative to the Buyer, the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer in good faith shall seek to resolve in writing
any differences that they may have with respect to the computation of the
Closing Net Working Capital as specified therein. Any disputed items resolved
in writing between the Sellers Representative and the Buyer within such
15‑Business Day period shall become part of the Final Closing Statement and be
final and binding with respect to such items, and if the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer agree in writing on the resolution of each
disputed item specified by the Sellers Representative in the Notice of
Disagreement and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital the amounts so
determined shall become part of the Final Closing Statement and be final and
binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. If the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer have not resolved all such differences by the end
of such 15‑Business Day period, within five Business Days following the end of
such 15‑Business Day period, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall
engage, pursuant to a standard engagement letter, Deloitte and Touche LLP or, if
such firm is unable or unwilling to act or is, at such time, not independent
of each of the Buyer Parties, the Sellers and the Sellers Representative, such
other independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed in writing by the
Sellers Representative and the Buyer (the "Independent Accounting Firm"), and,
within 15 Business Days following engagement of the Independent Accounting
Firm, shall submit, in writing, to the Independent Accounting Firm their
briefs detailing their respective views as to the correct nature and amount of
each item remaining in dispute and the amounts of the Closing Net Working
Capital, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written
determination as to each such disputed item and the amount of the Closing Net
Working Capital, which determination, along with the other amounts previously
agreed to by the parties pursuant to this Section 2.4, shall comprise the
Final Closing Statement and be final and binding on the parties for all
purposes hereunder and shall not be subject to appeal or further review. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the
Sellers Representative's and the Buyer's respective calculations of the
Closing Net Working Capital that are identified as being items and amounts to
which the Sellers Representative and the Buyer have been unable to agree. In
resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party. The Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render a
written decision, which shall specify, with particularity, resolution of the
matters submitted to it as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 30
Business Days following the submission thereof.

(d) The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to Section 2.4(c), including
the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the Sellers, on
the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on
the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined
by the Independent Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm
is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted. The fees and disbursements
of the Representatives of each party incurred in connection with the
preparation or review of the Initial Closing Statement and preparation or
review of any Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, shall be borne by such
party.

(e) The Buyer will, and will cause the Company to afford the Sellers
Representative and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the personnel, properties,
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to any other
information reasonably requested 

for purposes of preparing and reviewing the calculations contemplated by this
Section 2.4. Each party shall authorize its accountants to disclose work
papers generated by such accountants in connection with preparing and
reviewing the calculations of the Net Working Capital as specified in this
Section 2.4; provided, that such accountants shall not be obligated to make
any work papers available except in accordance with such accountants'
disclosure procedures and then only after the non-client party has signed an
agreement relating to access to such work papers in form and substance
acceptable to such accountants and that no party shall be required to provide
any attorney-client privileged communications pursuant to this Section 2.4(e).

(f) In accordance with the Final Closing Statement, the Estimated Purchase
Price shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as follows:

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Net Adjustment Amount" means an
amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) the Closing Net
Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, minus (B)
the Estimated Net Working Capital.

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, (A) the Estimated Purchase
Price shall be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment
Amount and (B) the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company (for
the benefit of the Sellers) an amount in cash equal to the Net Adjustment
Amount (not to exceed the initial downward adjustment, if any, from the
Estimated Net Working Capital adjustment) within five (5) Business Days of the
final determination of Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to this Section
2.4.

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (iii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount), (A) the Estimated Purchase Price
shall be adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount
and (B) the Buyer shall be entitled to permanently retain from the Holdback
Amount an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. In the event that the
Holdback Amount is insufficient to cover the full amount of the Net Adjustment
Amount, then the Sellers shall pay to the Buyer an amount in cash equal to the
amount of such deficiency within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination of Closing Net Working Capital pursuant to this Section 2.4.

Section 2.5 Sellers Representative.

(a) Each Seller Party hereby consents to the terms of this Section and to the
appointment of Jonathan Harrington as such Person's representative and
attorney-in-fact (the "Sellers Representative"), with full power of
substitution to act on behalf of such Seller Party to the extent and in the
manner set forth in this Agreement and any agreements ancillary to the
foregoing. All decisions, actions, consents and instructions by the Sellers
Representative with respect to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including all decisions,
actions, consents and instructions relating to the defense or settlement of
any claims for indemnification, shall be binding upon all Seller Parties and
no Seller Party shall have the right to object to, protest or otherwise
contest any such decision, action, consent or instruction. The Buyer shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on any decision, action, consent or instruction
of the Sellers Representative in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as being the
decision, action, consent or instruction of the Seller Parties, and the Buyer
is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts done by them in
accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction. The provisions
of this Section, including the power of attorney granted hereby, are
independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and
shall not be terminated by any act of any one or more Seller Parties, or by
operation of Law, whether by death or other event.

(b) The Sellers Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed for
any reason or no reason by the written consent of the Sellers; provided,
however, in no event shall the Sellers Representative resign or be removed
without the Sellers having first appointed a new Sellers Representative who
shall assume such duties immediately upon the resignation or removal of the
Sellers Representative. In the event of the death, incapacity, resignation or
removal of the Sellers Representative, a new Sellers Representative shall be
appointed by the written consent of the Sellers. Notice of such vote or a copy
of the written consent appointing such new Sellers Representative 

shall be sent to the Buyer, such appointment to be effective upon the later of
the date indicated in such consent or the date such notice is received by the
Buyer; provided, that until such notice is received, the Buyer shall be
entitled to rely on the decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the
prior Sellers Representative as described in paragraph (a) above. The Sellers
Representative may charge a reasonable fee for its services; provided, that
all fees and expenses incurred by the Sellers Representative in performing its
duties hereunder and under any Ancillary Agreement (including legal fees and
expenses related thereto) and any indemnification in favor of the Sellers
Representative shall be borne solely by the Sellers.

(c) The Sellers Representative shall not be liable to the Seller Parties for
actions taken pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, except to
the extent such actions shall have been determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have involved fraud. Except in cases where a court of
competent jurisdiction has made such a finding, the Seller Parties shall
jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers Representative
from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, arising out
of and in connection with its activities as Sellers Representative under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The Seller Parties shall promptly
reimburse the Sellers Representative for any expenses or fees incurred in
connection with the Sellers Representative's obligations hereunder ("Sellers
Representative Expenses"), and shall advance such Sellers Representative
Expenses as reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative from time to
time. If not paid directly to the Sellers Representative by the Seller
Parties, any such Sellers Representative Expenses may be recovered, or
advances may be drawn, by the Sellers Representative from the funds in the
Expense Fund. The Seller Parties acknowledge that the Sellers Representative
shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges or administration of its duties.

(d) In the event any notice or acknowledgement is required or permitted to be
given by or to any Seller Party under this Agreement, including any notice
under Section 8.4, such notice shall be given by, or delivered to, the Sellers
Representative in lieu of such Seller Party.

(e) By his or her acceptance of the Purchase Price, each Seller Owner shall be
deemed to have approved of all arrangements relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to the provisions hereof binding upon the Seller
Parties, including the indemnification provisions hereof.

(f) The Seller Parties will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Expense Fund and the monies held in the Expense Fund will be invested in a
non-interest bearing account. The Sellers Representative is not acting as a
withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense
Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations hereunder.
The Sellers Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice, and will not be liable for any loss of principal of
the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence, willful
misconduct or bad faith. The Sellers Representative will hold these funds
separate from its personal or corporate (as applicable) funds, will not use
these funds for its operating expenses or any other personal or corporate (as
applicable) purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to
its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Contemporaneous with or as soon as
practicable following the final release or retention of the Holdback Amount,
the Sellers Representative will deliver the balance of the Expense Fund to the
Sellers. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Seller Parties at the time of
Closing in accordance with the amounts set forth in the Closing Payment
Schedule. Any Tax withholding with respect to such deemed contribution by any
Seller Party shall be satisfied from such Seller Party's share of the Purchase
Price payable to the Sellers on the Closing Date and shall not reduce the
Expense Fund Contribution.

Section 2.6 Purchase Price Allocation. Within 150 days after the Closing,
Buyer shall propose a purchase price allocation among the Purchased Assets and
the Significant Owner Agreements (the "Purchase Price Allocation") to Sellers
Representative for its review and approval, which shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Within thirty days following Buyer's delivery of the
Purchase Price Allocation, the Sellers Representative shall inform the Buyer
in writing whether it has approved the Purchase Price Allocation (and in the
event that the Sellers Representative fails to respond in writing within such
30-day period, the Sellers Representative shall be deemed to have approved the
Purchase Price Allocation). Provided that 

the Sellers Representative approves the Purchase Price Allocation, all Tax
Returns filed by the Sellers and the Buyer (such as IRS Form 8594 or any other
forms or reports required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code or
any comparable provisions of applicable law ("Section 1060 Forms")) shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, except to
the extent otherwise required by a determination (within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code); provided, however, that (i) Buyer's cost for the
Purchased Assets and the Significant Owner Agreements may differ from the
total amount allocated hereunder to reflect the inclusion in the total cost of
items (for example, capitalized acquisition costs) not included in the amount
so allocated, (ii) the amount realized by Sellers may differ from the total
amount allocated hereunder to reflect transaction costs that reduce the amount
realized for federal income Tax purposes, and (iii) neither Sellers or any of
their Affiliates nor Buyer or any of its Affiliates will be obligated to
litigate any challenge to the Purchase Price Allocation by a Governmental
Authority. In the event of an adjustment to the Purchase Price, Sellers
Representative and Buyer agree to adjust the Purchase Price Allocation in a
reasonable manner to reflect such adjustment. If any Governmental Authority
disputes the Purchase Price Allocation, the party receiving notice of the
dispute shall promptly notify the other party and each party shall keep the
other reasonable informed of material developments of any such dispute.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sellers Representative does not approve the
Purchase Price Allocation then none of the Buyer, any Seller, nor any of their
Affiliates shall be required, pursuant hereto, to file any Tax Returns or
otherwise take any positions, in each case that are consistent with the
Purchase Price Allocation or the allocation of the other party, but instead
each party may allocate the consideration among the Purchased Assets and the
Significant Owner Agreements in a manner it considers appropriate and file its
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with its allocation. In addition, the
parties hereto agree that to the extent there are any assets being transferred
by the Sellers under this Agreement that are not eligible for installment
reporting under Section 453 of the Code, such assets shall be treated as being
transferred for the cash payable at Closing; provided, however, that Seller
agrees that (1) Buyer has not made any representation or warranty to Seller as
to the Tax consequences of agreeing to treat such assets as being transferred
for the cash payable at Closing and (2) no Buyer Party shall have any
liability to any Seller Indemnified Party under this Agreement arising from
its agreement to treat such assets as being transferred for the cash payable
at Closing.

Section 2.7 Withholding Rights. Each of the Buyer and its Affiliates, as the
case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold under any provision of applicable Law with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that such amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the relevant Governmental Authority by the Buyer or
its Affiliates, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in
respect to which such deduction and withholding was made. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer and Seller agree that no withholding shall be made by Buyer
under any bulk sale laws with respect to any sales and use Taxes of the
Sellers.

and the Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, will not give rise to any right of any third party to
terminate or re-price or otherwise modify any of the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' rights or obligations under any agreement under which any right
or license of or under Intellectual Property is granted to or by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

Representatives to, afford the Buyer Parties and their Representatives
complete access (including for inspection and copying) at all reasonable times
during normal business hours, and with reasonable prior notice to the
Representatives, properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books and
records of the 

Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish the Buyer Parties with
such financial, operating and other data and information as the Buyer Parties
may reasonably request. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the
contrary, no such investigation or examination shall be permitted to the
extent that it would require the Seller Parties to disclose (i) due diligence
questions, lists or investigations conducted by others, names, bids, letters
of intent, expressions of interest, or other proposals received from others in
connection with the proposed sale of the Company and its Subsidiaries
solicited by VistaPoint Advisors, LLC or other information and analyses
relating to such communications or (ii) information (w) subject to attorney-
client privilege, (x) which would conflict with any confidentiality
obligations to which the Seller Parties are bound (y) in violation of
applicable Law, or (z) that forms a part of the analysis of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby by the Seller Parties.

(b) On the Closing Date, each Seller will deliver, or cause to be delivered,
to the Buyer all original (and any and all copies of) agreements, documents,
and books and records and all computer disks, records or tapes or any other
storage medium on which agreements, documents, books and records, files and
other information relating to the business and operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are stored, in each case, that are in the possession or under
the control of any Seller. Following the Closing Date, no Seller Party shall
retain in its possession or under its control, in any form, any agreements,
documents, or books and records, or any computer disks, records or tapes or
any other storage medium that contains copies of any agreements, documents,
books and records, files and other information relating to the business and
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any personal or
other information stored on any media by any employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries), including any of the foregoing that is stored on any
server or other storage media maintained by a third party on behalf of any
Seller Party (including any "cloud" storage platform). If, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Seller Party discovers following the Closing Date that he, she
or it is in possession of or has under his, her or its control any agreements,
documents, or books and records or any computer disks, records or tapes or any
other storage medium on which any agreements, documents, books and records,
files and other information relating to the Business and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries are stored, such Seller Parties shall (x) deliver
to the Buyer any such information which may not have been previously delivered
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.2(b) and (y) thereafter
permanently delete and erase all such information (including all copies
thereof) in its possession or under its control as soon as reasonably
practicable.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.2(b), the Seller Parties shall
not be required to deliver information to the Buyer to the extent disclosure
of such information would (i) jeopardize any attorney-client privilege,
protection under the work product doctrine or other legal privilege, (ii)
contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date hereof or (iii) relate to any consolidated, combined or
unitary Return filed by the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or
any of their respective predecessor entities.

Section 5.3 Exclusivity. Each Seller Party agrees that between the date of
this Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement, he, she or it shall not, and shall take all action necessary to
ensure that none of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall, directly or indirectly:

(a) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or accept any other proposals or
offers from any Person (i) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the capital stock or other equity or
ownership interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than inventory to be sold in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) to enter into
any merger, consolidation or other business combination relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) to enter into a recapitalization,
reorganization or any other extraordinary business transaction involving or
otherwise relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an
"Alternate Transaction"); or

(b) with the intention of doing so, participate in any discussions,
conversations, negotiations or other communications regarding, or furnish to
any other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in
any way, assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort or
attempt by any other Person to seek to do any of the foregoing. Each Seller
Party immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. 

The Sellers Representative shall notify the Parent promptly, but in any event
within 24 hours, orally and in writing if any such proposal or offer, or any
inquiry or other contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made. Any
such notice to the Parent shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of
the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and, to the
extent known, the terms and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact. No Seller Party shall, and each such Person shall cause the
Sellers not to, release any Person from, or waive any provision of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which any Seller Party is a party,
without the prior written consent of the Buyer.

Section 5.4 Notification of Certain Matters. The Sellers Representative shall
give prompt written notice to Parent of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence
of any change, condition or event, the occurrence or non‑occurrence of which
would render any representation or warranty of a Seller Party contained in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, if made on or immediately following
the date of such event, untrue or inaccurate, (b) the occurrence of any
change, condition or event that has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect, (c) any failure of a Seller Party or any of their
respective Affiliates to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or any event or condition that
would otherwise result in the nonfulfillment of any of the conditions to the
Buyer Parties' obligations hereunder, (d) any notice or other communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or (e) any Action pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened against a party or the parties relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements. No notice to Parent of the matters set forth in clauses (a)
through (e) of this Section 5.4 with respect to any material matter, condition
or occurrence hereunder arising, which, if existing or occurring on any date
prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in the Disclosure Schedule ("Updated Schedules"), shall be deemed
to cure any breach of or alter any representation or warranty made in this
Agreement so as to (i) permit the Closing to occur or (ii) affect any
Indemnified Party's right to indemnification pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, unless
the Sellers Representative can demonstrate any such Updated Schedule relates
solely to matters, conditions or occurrences that arose after the date of this
Agreement, in which case the Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification for Losses arising out of the disclosure on such Updated
Schedule in an aggregate amount of up to $150,000. In addition, if, following
delivery of the Updated Schedules, Parent reasonably determines that the
amount of potential Losses resulting from the updated matters set forth on the
Updated Schedules is reasonably likely to exceed $150,000, individually or in
the aggregate, Parent shall be entitled to immediately terminate this
Agreement upon written notice to Sellers Representative.

Section 5.5 Release of Indemnity Obligations. Effective as of the Closing,
each Seller Party does hereby, for itself and each of its Affiliates
(excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries other than On-Site Plant) and each
of its and their Related Parties (each, a "Seller Releasing Party"),
irrevocably release, waive and absolutely forever discharge the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries and all of their respective, past, present and future
officers, directors, agents, representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the "Released Persons"), from any and all actions, causes of
action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, bonds, bills, covenants,
contracts, controversies, agreements, promises, variances, trespasses,
damages, judgments, executions, claims and demands of every type and nature
whatsoever, known or unknown, at law or in equity (each a "Claim" and
collectively, the "Claims"), that any Seller Releasing Party has had, may now
have or may hereinafter have against any Released Person relating to, arising
out of or resulting from any matter, act or omission whatsoever during all
periods through the Closing and whether or not first asserted before or after
the Closing (together, the "Released Matters"). The Released Matters shall not
include (i) any agreement listed on Schedule 5.5 of the Disclosure Schedules
or (ii) this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. It is the intention of each
Seller Party in providing this release to the Released Persons, and in giving
and receiving the consideration called for in this Agreement, that this
release shall be effective as a full and final accord and satisfaction and
general release of and from all Released Matters and the final resolution by
the applicable Seller Releasing Party, the Company and its Subsidiaries of all
Released Matters.

Section 5.6 Confidentiality.

(a) Each of the parties shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives to
hold, in confidence all documents and information furnished to it by or on
behalf of the other party in connection with the transactions 

contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of the confidentiality agreement
dated December 16, 2013 between Parent and the Company. (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), which shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing
Date, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the
parties under this Section 5.6(a) shall terminate. If for any reason this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

(b) For a period of five years following the Closing Date, each Seller Party
shall not, and each Seller Party shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives not to, use for its or their own benefit or divulge
or convey to any third party, any Confidential Information; provided, however,
that any Seller Party or its Affiliates may furnish such portion (and only
such portion) of the Confidential Information as such Seller Party or such
Affiliate reasonably determines it is legally obligated to disclose if: (i) it
receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information
under the terms of a subpoena, civil investigative demand or order issued by a
Governmental Authority; (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with such request,
it notifies the Parent of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding
such request and consults with the Parent on the advisability of taking steps
available under applicable Law to resist or narrow such request; (iii) it
exercises its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an order or other
reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the
disclosed Confidential Information at Buyer's expense; and (iv) disclosure of
such Confidential Information is required to prevent such Seller Party or such
Affiliate from being held in contempt or becoming subject to any other penalty
under applicable Law. Furthermore, any Seller Party or its Affiliates may
furnish such portion (and only such portion) of the Confidential Information
as such Seller Party or such Affiliate reasonably determines it is reasonably
necessary or appropriate in order to narrow or oppose the efforts of a third
party with respect to any subpoena, civil investigative demand or order issued
by a Governmental Authority. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential
Information" consists of all information and data relating to the Company or
its Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated hereby (other than data or
information that (w) is known or available through other lawful sources not
known by the Seller Parties to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with,
or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the
Sellers; (x) is or becomes publicly known or generally known in the industry
through no fault of the Seller Parties or their Representatives; (y) relates
to the Tax aspects and consequences of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (z) is released as part of a public announcement of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, as permitted by this
Agreement). Furthermore, any Seller Party or its Affiliates may furnish
Confidential Information to its legal, financial and tax advisors as
reasonably necessary for such advisors to perform their duties to such Person,
and as reasonably necessary to enable any such Person enforce their
obligations under this Agreement.

permitted by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate. Subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Buyer and the Sellers Representative will consult 

and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or

filing or investigation; provided, however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer shall be entitled, after consultation with the Sellers
Representative, to make all strategic and tactical decisions as to the manner
in which to obtain any such consents, including any decision to make any
filing or to enter into any agreement with a Governmental Authority regarding
the timing of any investigation or waiting period relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

with respect to any HSR Act filing or other filing to Buyer's and the Sellers
Representative's respective outside counsel only.

(c) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 5.7, each Seller and the
Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements as promptly as practicable, including to (i) obtain from
Governmental Authorities and other Persons all consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders as are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, and (ii) promptly make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement
required under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, the Sellers shall permit the Buyer reasonably
to participate in the defense and settlement of any claim, suit or cause of
action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the Sellers shall not settle or compromise any such claim, suit or cause of
action without the Buyer's written consent.

parties and obtain such third-party consents and estoppel certificates as are
explicitly required by this Agreement. The Buyer shall cooperate with and
assist the Sellers in giving such notices and obtaining such consents and
estoppel certificates; provided, however, that the Buyer shall have no
obligation to give any guarantee or other consideration of any nature in
connection with any such notice, consent or estoppel certificate or consent to
any change in the terms of any agreement or arrangement that the Buyer in its
sole discretion may deem adverse to the interests of the Buyer or the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. The Sellers Representative shall provide the Buyer
with copies of any consents or estoppel certificates obtained pursuant to this
Section 5.7(d).

(e) The Buyer on the one hand and the Sellers on the other hand shall each be
responsible for paying any fees and other costs (including, but not limited
to, legal and consultant fees) incurred by that party relating to any third-
party consents, including but not limited to fees and other costs relating to
the preparation of any filings or submissions to any Governmental Authority
(other than filing fees incurred in connection with regulatory filings made
pursuant to this Section 5.7, which shall be paid one-half by the Buyer, on
the one hand, and one-half by the Sellers, on the other hand); provided,
however, that no party shall be required to pay any fees or other payments to
any Governmental Authority in order to obtain any such consent (other than
filing fees incurred in connection with regulatory filings made pursuant to
this Section 5.7, which shall be paid one-half by the Buyer, on the one hand,
and one-half by the Sellers, on the other hand). If any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Competition Law or if any suit or proceeding is instituted or threatened by
any Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violating any Competition Law, the Buyer
and each Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts to promptly resolve
such objections in order to enable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated as promptly as practicable, provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, that each party hereto shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to defend any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Competition Law, including but not limited to seeking to have any stay,
injunction, or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed.

(f) Each Seller and the Buyer agree that, in the event that any consent,
approval or authorization necessary or desirable to preserve for the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries any right or benefit under any lease, license,
commitment or other Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party
is not obtained prior to the 

Closing, each Seller will, subsequent to the Closing, cooperate with the
Buyer, the Company or any such Subsidiary in attempting to obtain such
consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable.

(g) From time to time after the Closing, and for no further consideration,
each of the Parties shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, execute,
acknowledge and deliver such assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions and
other documents and instruments and take such other actions as may be
necessary or desirable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(h) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer Parties shall
not be required by this Section 5.7 to take or agree to undertake any action,
including entering into any consent decree, hold separate order or other
arrangement, that would (i) require the divestiture of any assets of the Buyer
Parties or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) limit the Buyer Parties'
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and control,
the Business or the Purchased Assets or any of the Buyer's or its Affiliates'
other assets or businesses, or (iii) limit the Buyer Parties' ability to

other actions reasonably requested by the Buyer Parties to facilitate the
termination of all Contracts relating to Payoff Indebtedness, the termination
of the commitments provided thereunder, the repayment in full of all
obligations then outstanding thereunder (using funds provided by the Buyer)
and the release of all Encumbrances in connection therewith on the Closing
Date; provided, however, that in no event shall this Section 5.8 require any
of the Sellers to cause the termination of any Contracts relating to Payoff
Indebtedness other than as part of the Closing.

Section 5.9 Public Announcements. The Sellers Representative shall consult
with Parent before issuing, and provide Parent the opportunity to review,
comment upon and approve, any press release or other public statement with

or make any such public statement prior to receiving such approval from
Parent, except as may be required by applicable Law.

Section 5.10 Delivery of Additional Financial Statements.

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing, each Seller shall cause to be
delivered to the Buyer within 10 days after the end of each calendar month an
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
the related consolidated statements of income, retained earnings,
stockholders' equity and changes in financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, together with all related notes and schedules thereto, in each
case, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) (such sets of monthly financial statements, the "Pre-Closing Monthly

accountant shall be engaged to prepare such financial statements contemplated
pursuant to this Section 5.10(a), Buyer shall bear the costs thereof.

(b) Sellers shall, at the expense of Buyer, promptly engage an auditor
selected by Buyer to commence preparation of, and shall cooperate with the

to each other, as soon as reasonably practicable after written request
therefor and at the requesting party's sole expense, reasonable access
(including using commercially reasonable efforts to give access to Sellers'
auditors, accountants and other advisors reasonably requested by each party),
during normal business hours, to the other party's representatives and to any
books, records, files, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence,
writings, evidences of title and other papers relating to the Business and the
Purchased Assets (the "Books and Records") in the possession or under the
control of the other Party with respect to periods prior to the Closing that
the requesting Party reasonably needs (i) to comply with reporting,
disclosure, filing, auditing or other requirements imposed on the requesting
party (including under applicable securities laws) by a Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction over the requesting party in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein, (ii) for use in any other judicial,
regulatory, administrative or other proceeding or in order to satisfy audit,
accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation or other similar requirements
arising from the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, or (iii) to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that no
party shall be required under this provision to provide access to or disclose
information if the parties are in a dispute with each other regarding matters
related to such information request or where such access or disclosure would
violate any Law, protective order or confidentiality agreement, or waive any
attorney-client, attorney work product or other similar privilege, and each
party may redact information regarding itself or its affiliates or otherwise
not relating to the other party and its affiliates, to the extent such
redaction is not related to the Business, and, in the event such provision of
information could reasonably be expected to violate any Law, protective order
or confidentiality agreement or waive any attorney-client, attorney work
product or other similar privilege, the parties shall take commercially
reasonable measures to permit the compliance with such obligations in a manner
that avoids any such harm or consequence, to the extent practicable. Each
Party shall retain the Books and Records relating to the Business in such
party's respective possession or control for the greater of (i) seven years
following the Closing Date or (ii) such period of time as may be required by
applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party may destroy or
otherwise dispose of any Books and Records not in accordance with its
retention policy, provided that, prior to such destruction or disposal (i)
such party shall provide no less than 30 days' prior written notice to the
other party of any such proposed destruction or disposal (which notice shall
specify in detail which of the Books and Records is proposed to be so
destroyed or disposed of), and (ii) if a recipient of such notice shall
request in writing prior to the scheduled date for such destruction or
disposal that any of the information proposed to be destroyed or disposed of
be delivered to such recipient, such party proposing the destruction or
disposal shall, as promptly as practicable, arrange for the delivery of such
of the Books and Records as was requested by the recipient (it being
understood that all reasonable out-of-pocket costs associated with the
delivery of the requested Books and Records shall be paid by such recipient).

Section 5.14 Employment and Benefit Matters.

(a) Buyer shall in its sole discretion offer employment to certain Business
Employees as of the Closing Date, each such offer to be pursuant to an offer
letter on Parent's standard form (and conditioned upon execution by such
employee of Parent's standard employment documentation) for an indeterminate
period of time with Buyer, conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing;
provided, that such offers of employment shall be with respect to base salary
and cash bonus eligibility in such amounts as are determined by Buyer in its
sole discretion based upon Buyer's review of duties performed by each
employee, and the start date for each such Business Employee shall be on the
Closing Date (the "Offers"). Any such Business Employee who accepts Buyer's
offer of employment and commences employment with Buyer shall be referred to,
individually, as a "Transferred Employee" and, collectively, as the 

"Transferred Employees." Buyer's employment of each such Business Employee in
accordance with this Section 5.14(a) shall begin as of the commencement of the
applicable date of hire (the "Hire Date"), and the employment and other
relationships of such Business Employee with Sellers and their Affiliates
shall end immediately prior to such date. Sellers shall use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer in employing as new employees of Buyer
all such Transferred Employees. Buyer shall in no way be obligated to continue
to employ any Transferred Employee for any specific period of time, except to
the extent otherwise provided in any written agreement entered into by Buyer
and/or any Subsidiary thereof and any Transferred Employee after the Closing.

(b) Sellers shall be liable for, or for causing, the administration and
payment of all workers' compensation and health and welfare Liabilities and
benefits (including Liabilities arising out of the termination of employment
of any Business Employee) with respect to any Transferred Employees to the
extent resulting from claims arising prior to the Hire Date. For purposes of
the preceding sentence, claims shall be considered incurred on the date when
medical/dental services are rendered or medical/dental supplies provided, and
not when the condition arose or the course of treatment began. Sellers shall
be liable for the administration and provision of benefits under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") with respect
to Business Employees and/or any former employees of Sellers or other
qualified beneficiaries associated with any Business Employees or former
employees of Sellers with respect to qualifying events that occur before the
Hire Date or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. Sellers
further agree and acknowledge that in the event any Seller ceases to provide,
or ceases to cause the provision of, any group health plan to any employee
prior to the expiration of the COBRA continuation coverage period for all MandA
qualified beneficiaries (as defined by Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9,
QandA-4(a)) with respect to the transactions contemplated herein, then the
Sellers shall provide Buyer written notice of such cessation at least 10 days
in advance thereof and shall provide all information necessary for Buyer to
offer COBRA continuation coverage to such MandA qualified beneficiaries in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-8(c); provided,
that Buyer shall be obligated to offer such coverage only to the extent
required by applicable law. The Sellers shall be responsible for 100% of the
costs of any such COBRA benefits required to be paid by Buyer (including
administrative costs) as a result of the preceding sentence. Buyer will be
responsible for COBRA coverage for Transferred Employees (and each such
employee's qualified beneficiaries) whose qualifying event occurs on or after
the applicable Hire Date, to the extent required by law.

(c) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.14 with respect to
Transferred Employees, Buyer shall have no obligation or Liability with
respect to any Business Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof) up to and including the Closing Date and Sellers shall remain
responsible for any obligation or Liability, whether contractual or statutory,
arising out of Sellers' employment or termination of Business Employees.
Nothing in this Agreement confers upon any Business Employee or Transferred
Employee any rights or remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by

Section 5.15 Name Change. Within 10 days after the Closing Date, Sellers
shall, or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, file

Liabilities to Buyer.

Section 5.17 Post-Closing Collection; Mail Handling. Each Seller Party agrees
to hold any cash receipts or proceeds of Purchased Assets that come into its
possession or control following the Closing Date in trust for the sole benefit
of Buyer and will, as soon as administratively feasible, but in no event more

proceeds to Buyer. To the extent any Seller Party receives any payments or
refunds or any other proceeds in respect of the Purchased Assets or any
Assumed Contract or otherwise arising out of the Business, such Seller shall
cause such amounts to be remitted promptly to Buyer. To the extent any Seller

ARTICLE VI 
TAX MATTERS

Section 6.1 Apportionment. For the sole purpose of appropriately apportioning
any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that is
attributable to the part of such Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date
shall be (i) in the case of a Tax that is not transaction-based, the total
amount of such Tax for the full Tax period that includes the Closing Date
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from
the beginning of such Tax period up to and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such full Tax period, and
(ii) in the case of transaction-based Taxes, the Tax that would be due with
respect to such partial period based on an interim closing of the books as of
the end of the Closing Date.

Section 6.2 Tax Returns. 

(a) Seller Responsibility. The Company, at its own cost and expense, will
prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed
all Tax Returns (excluding Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes, which
shall be handled pursuant to Section 6.5) of (i) any Seller that are required
to be filed for any Tax period, including all Tax Returns required to be filed
with respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and (ii) On-Site Labs and DepositIQ with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (collectively, the Tax Returns described in (i) and (ii), the "Seller
Prepared Tax Returns"). Such Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of the relevant Seller unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. In the case of (x) Seller Prepared Tax Returns
that are relevant to the calculation of the Buyer State Income Tax Liability
(the "Seller State Income Tax Returns") and (y) any Seller Prepared Tax Return
with respect to On-Site Labs or DepositIQ (collectively, the Tax Returns
referred to in (x) and (y), the "Reviewable Seller Tax Returns"), no later
than thirty (30) days prior to filing, the Sellers Representative will deliver
to Buyer a draft of such Reviewable Seller Tax Returns (along with a statement
detailing the Sellers Representative's calculation of the Buyer State Income
Tax Liability, including the portion of such liability that is attributable to
each applicable state or local jurisdiction, and the amount, if any, of any
Tax reflected on such Reviewable Seller Tax Return for which the Sellers
Representative claims the Buyer is liable under the definition of Pre-Closing
Tax in Article I) for Buyer's review and comment, and Sellers Representative
shall consider in good faith any revisions to such Reviewable Seller Tax
Returns as are reasonably requested by Buyer. In the event that Buyer and
Sellers Representative have not resolved any dispute relating to (i) the
calculation of the Buyer State Income Tax Liability (or the apportionment of
the Buyer State Income Tax Liability among the applicable state and local
jurisdictions) or (ii) the amount of any Tax reflected on such Reviewable
Seller Tax Return for which the Buyer is liable under the definition of Pre-
Closing Tax in Article I, in each case at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
due date for filing the Seller State Income Tax Returns, any disputed issues
relating to the calculation of the Buyer State Income Tax Liability or the
amount of any Tax reflected on such Reviewable Seller Tax Return for which the
Buyer is liable under the definition of Pre-Closing Tax in Article I shall be
resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm (with the Buyer and the Company
sharing equally the costs of the Independent Accounting Firm). The Company
will be responsible for and shall timely pay (or cause to be timely paid) any
Taxes reported on any Seller Prepared Tax Returns to the extent such Taxes are
the responsibility of the Seller Parties under this Agreement; provided that,
Buyer shall make a payment to the Company in an amount equal to the amount of
any Taxes that Buyer is liable for under the definition of Pre-Closing Tax in
Article I (plus, in the case of a Seller State Income Tax Return, the portion
of the Buyer State Income Tax Liability) and that is reflected on a Seller
Prepared Tax Return within five (5) days after the Sellers Representative has
provided written evidence to the Buyer that such Seller Prepared Tax Return
has been filed and that the Taxes reflected on such Seller Prepared Tax Return
have been paid in full; provided, further, that notwithstanding anything else
to the contrary in this Agreement, (1) no Seller Party other than the Company
shall have any claim under this Agreement for any Losses with respect to the
Buyer State Income Tax Liability and (2) in the case of the Company, any claim
with respect to Buyer's payment of Taxes for a Seller State Income Tax Return
under this Section 6.2(a) shall be limited to the applicable portion of the
Buyer State Income Tax Liability and the amount of Taxes that Buyer is liable
for under the definition of Pre-Closing Tax in Article I and that have not
been paid by Buyer to the Company under this Section 6.2(a); and provided,
further, that no Buyer Party has assumed, and nothing in this Section 6.2, in
Section 8.3 or otherwise in this Agreement shall be construed as an agreement
by any Buyer Party to assume, any income, franchise or similar Tax liability
of the Company or any other Seller Party. For the avoidance of doubt, if any
adjustment is made to any Seller State Income Tax Return after it is initially
filed (whether as a result of an audit or other Tax proceeding or otherwise),
no additional amount shall be required to be paid between the parties with
respect to the Buyer State Income Tax Liability as a result of such
adjustment.

(b) Buyer Responsibility. Buyer, at its own cost and expense, will prepare or
cause to be prepared and timely file all Tax Returns of On-Site Labs and
DepositIQ for any Straddle Period ("Buyer Prepared Tax Returns"). To the
extent that a Buyer Prepared Tax Return relates solely to the business of On-
Site Labs and/or DepositIQ (i.e., does not include Tax information related to
the assets, operations or activities of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
other than On-Site Labs and DepositIQ) and reflects a liability for Taxes in
excess of $50,000 (such Buyer Prepared Tax Return, a "Reviewable Buyer Tax
Return"), such Reviewable Buyer Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner
consistent with the prior practice of On-Site Labs and DepositIQ (except to
the extent otherwise required by applicable Law). No later than twenty (20)
days prior to filing, the Buyer will deliver to Sellers Representative such
Reviewable Buyer Tax Return for Sellers Representative's review and comment,
and Buyer shall consider in good faith any revisions to such Reviewable Buyer
Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Sellers Representative. On-Site
Labs and DepositIQ 

will be responsible for paying any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. The
Seller Parties shall reimburse the Buyer for the Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities
reflected on any Buyer Prepared Tax Return within five (5) days after Buyer
has provided written evidence to the Sellers Representative that the Taxes
reflected on such Buyer Prepared Tax Return have been paid.

Section 6.3 Tax Refunds. Any Tax refunds received by the Buyer (or its
Affiliates) with respect to Pre-Closing Taxes that were actually paid or
otherwise borne by the Seller Parties shall be for the account of the Company
in an amount up to $2,000,000 and the Buyer shall pay over such amount to the
Sellers Representative within ten (10) Business Days of receipt; provided,
however, that the foregoing provision shall not apply to any portion of any
refund that (i) arises as a result of the carryback of Tax items accruing or
otherwise generated in a Tax period beginning after the Closing or by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates or (ii) was taken into account as a current asset in the
calculation of Net Working Capital. If requested by the Sellers
Representative, Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with the Sellers
Representative (at the Seller Parties' expense) in filing any Tax Return
necessary to claim such Tax refunds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
in the event that a Tax refund is subsequently determined by any Governmental
Authority to be less than the amount paid by Buyer to the Sellers
Representative, the Seller Parties shall promptly return any such disallowed
amounts (plus any interest charged by the Governmental Authority in respect of
such disallowed Tax refunds owed to the Governmental Authority) to Buyer. The
Buyer shall promptly pay any such disallowed amounts and interest to the
Governmental Authority and provide evidence of such payment to the Sellers
Representative. The Buyer may set off any amount owed by the Buyer under this
Section 6.3 against any amount owed to any Buyer Indemnified Party by any
Seller Party under this Agreement.

Section 6.4 Maintenance of Tax Books and Records. The Seller Parties and Buyer
agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as
promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the
Business, the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities (including access to
Books and Records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any
audit by any taxing authority, and the prosecution or defense of any action,
suit or proceeding, claim, arbitration, litigation or investigation relating
to any Tax. Any expenses incurred in furnishing such information or assistance
shall be borne by the party requesting it. Sellers shall preserve all Tax
information, records, and documents relating to Taxes for periods beginning
prior to the Closing Date until the expiration of any applicable statutes of
limitation or extensions thereof and as otherwise required by Law. Sellers
shall provide timely notice to Buyer in writing of any pending or threatened
Tax audits, actions, claims, assessments or information request related to (i)
the Purchase Price Allocation (ii) the Purchased Assets for periods beginning
prior to the Closing Date, or (iii) Transfer Taxes, and in each case furnish
the other with copies of all correspondence (or applicable portions thereof)
received from any taxing authority in connection with any such Tax audit,
action, claim, assessment or information request. For the avoidance of doubt,
to the extent of any conflict between the provisions of this Section 6.4 and
Section 5.13, the provisions of this Section 6.4 shall control.

Section 6.5 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
recording, property, registration, and other similar transfer Taxes, and all
conveyance fees, recording charges and other charges and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes" ) shall be paid
50% by Buyer and 50% by the Sellers when due. All necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and
filed by the party required by law to file such Tax Returns, with the
reasonable expenses of preparing and filing such Tax Returns shared equally by
Buyer and the Sellers. Each party shall provide the other party with copies of
all Tax Returns and other documentation for Transfer Taxes and evidence that
such Transfer Taxes have been paid. The parties hereto shall cooperate in
connection with the filing of any such Tax Returns for Transfer Taxes
including joining in the execution of such Tax Returns. To the extent
permitted by Law, Buyer and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with each other
in minimizing such Transfer Taxes, including without limitation, through the
electronic transfer of software and other assets where reasonably possible to
obtain an exemption from such Transfer Taxes.

Section 6.6 Tax Contests. Buyer shall have the right but not the obligation to
control the defense of any Third-Party Claim with respect to Taxes of On-Site
Labs or DepositIQ, and all reasonable fees and expenses of the Buyer's counsel
shall be borne by the Seller Parties. The Sellers Representative shall have
the right to employ 

counsel separate from counsel employed by Buyer in any such action and to
participate in (but not control) the defense of such action at its sole
expense. If the Buyer assumes the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, the
Buyer will select counsel to conduct the defense of such claim or proceeding,
will take all steps necessary in the defense or settlement thereof and will at
all times diligently and promptly pursue the resolution thereof. If the Buyer
assumed the defense of any claim or proceeding in accordance with this Section
6.6, the Buyer will be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry
of any judgment arising from, any such claim or proceeding, with the prior
written consent of the Sellers Representative (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld). To the extent of any conflict between the provisions of this
Section 6.6 and the provisions of Section 8.4(b), the provisions of this
Section 6.6 shall govern.

all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, interest, awards, judgments,
penalties, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and
other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending

Section 8.4 Procedures.

(a) A party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") in respect of,
arising out of or involving a Loss or a claim or demand made by any person
against the Indemnified Party (a "Third-Party Claim") shall deliver notice (a
"Claim Notice") in respect thereof to the party against whom indemnity is
sought (the "Indemnifying Party") with reasonable promptness after receipt by
such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim, and shall promptly
provide the Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to deliver a Claim
Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing or anything herein contained to the contrary, any
Claim Notices delivered shall specify, with reasonable detail and
particularity, the nature of the Claim, the section or sections of the
Agreement to which the Claim relates, and the amount of such Losses (if known)
or a good faith, reasonable estimate of such Losses (to the extent
ascertainable at such time) (the "Claimed Losses" ) and the basis upon which
such calculation or estimate has been determined (together with reasonable
supporting documentation therefor).

(b) Except with respect to any Special Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the right (by notifying the Indemnified Party in writing of its intent
within 20 days after receipt of the Third-Party Claim Notice) but not the
obligation to control the defense of any Third-Party Claim, and all reasonable
fees and expenses of the Indemnifying Party's counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Parties. If the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense of
a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
counsel separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party in any such
action and to participate in (but not control) the defense of such action at
its sole expense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will select counsel to conduct the
defense of such claim or proceeding, will take all steps necessary in the
defense or settlement thereof and will at all times diligently and promptly
pursue the resolution thereof. If the Third-Party Claim is a Special Claim, or
if the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim or proceeding resulting therefrom in accordance with the terms of this
Section 8.4, the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or
proceeding, and shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party for such
reasonable costs and expenses, in the manner the Indemnified Party may deem
appropriate, including settling such claim or proceeding on such terms as the
Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, with the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). All parties to this Agreement shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of such Third Party Claim and shall furnish such records,
information and testimony and shall attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings and trials as may be reasonably requested in connection with such
Third-Party Claim; provided, that no party shall be required to grant access
or furnish information to the extent that such information is subject to an
attorney/client or attorney work product privilege; and provided further, that
a party and/or its counsel shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
enter into such joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as
appropriate, so as to allow for such disclosure in a manner that does not
result in the loss of attorney/client or attorney work product privilege. Each
party shall act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner in
addressing any adverse consequences that may result in the basis for an
indemnifiable claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumed the defense of any
claim or proceeding in accordance with this Section 8.4, the Indemnifying
Party will be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such claim or proceeding, 

with the prior written consent of each relevant Indemnified Party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party
will pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or
judgment concurrent with the effectiveness thereof; provided further, that the
Indemnifying Party is not authorized to encumber any of the assets of any
Indemnified Party or to agree to any restriction that would apply to any
Indemnified Party or to its conduct of business; and provided further, that a
condition to any such settlement is a complete release of each relevant
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and
agents with respect to the claim made.

(c) An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification in respect of, arising out of
or involving a Loss or a claim or demand hereunder that does not involve a
Third‑Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party (a "Direct Claim") shall deliver a Claim Notice in respect
thereof to the Indemnifying Party with reasonable promptness after becoming
aware of facts supporting such Direct Claim, and shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to deliver a Claim
Notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to the
Indemnified Party or otherwise than pursuant to this Article VIII. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 20 days
following its receipt of a Claim Notice in respect of a Direct Claim that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability (in whole or in part) to the
Indemnified Party hereunder, which may consist of, for the avoidance of doubt,
an objection based on the inability to determine (i) the propriety of
indemnification of any or all claims contained in the Claim Notice, (ii) the
accuracy of any statement of fact or Losses set forth in the Claim Notice
and/or (iii) to the extent the Claim Notice seeks indemnification under
Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a), the fact that the facts alleged in the Claim
Notice do not constitute a breach of a representation or warranty for which
indemnification is available pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a), as
applicable (any such notice, an "Objection Notice"), such Direct Claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such Claim Notice shall be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on
demand. If the Indemnifying Party timely disputes (in whole or in part) its
liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder in accordance with the terms
hereof, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will, for a period of
30 days following delivery of the Objection Notice, negotiate in good faith to
resolve the items disputed in the Objection Notice. During such 30-day period
each of such parties shall promptly provide the other with such information
regarding the Direct Claim as such other party may reasonably request. If the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to fully resolve the
items disputed in the Objection Notice during such 30-day period, the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to initiate such
proceedings and seek such remedies as may be permitted under the terms of this
Agreement.

(d) Subject to Section 8.5, the indemnification required hereunder shall be
made by prompt payment by the Indemnifying Party of the amount of actual
Losses in connection therewith, promptly following agreement between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party of the amount of Losses incurred
or if no such agreement, upon receipt of a final, non-appealable court order
determining the amount of such Losses.

(e) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require that any action be
made or brought against any other Person before action is brought or claim is
made against it hereunder by the Indemnified Party.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Closing, the Buyer shall not
initiate any discussions, proceedings, audits, examinations or any other
contacts relating to sales and use Taxes of the Company with any Governmental
Authority for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, without the consent of Sellers
Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
Sellers Representative shall have the right to determine which Governmental
Authority to initiate discussions with regarding resolution, including
voluntary disclosure agreements, of outstanding sales and use Tax liability of
Seller for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. The rights of the parties to control and
participate in the process and defense of any such sales and use Tax matters
(including with respect to settlement) shall be governed in the same manner as
Third Party Claims under Section 8.4(b). For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Buyer
shall have the right to initiate any discussions, proceedings, audits,
examinations, voluntary disclosure agreements, or any other contacts relating
to sales and use Taxes of On-Site Labs and DepositIQ with any Governmental
Authority for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle 

Period, without the consent of Sellers Representative, (ii) the Sellers
Representative shall have the right to participate (at its own expense) in the
process and defense of any such sales and use Tax matters and Buyer shall not
consent to settlement of any such matter without the consent of the Sellers
Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), and (iii) nothing
in this Agreement shall be construed to limit Buyer's ability after the
Closing to file Tax Returns with any Governmental Authority with respect to
any sales or use Taxes of On-Site Labs, Deposit IQ, or Buyer (or any of its
Affiliates) for any Tax period that is a Straddle Period or that begins after
the Closing Date. No action by Buyer or any of its Affiliates that is
authorized in this Section 8.4(f) shall result in any limitation on any Seller
Party's obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to
Losses for any Sales Tax Claim pursuant to this Agreement.

(g) To the extent any provision of this Section 8.4 is in conflict with or
inconsistent with the provisions of Article VI, Article VI shall govern.

Section 8.5 Holdback.

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall retain an amount equal to the Holdback Amount,
which will constitute partial security for the satisfaction of the Seller
Parties' indemnity and other obligations under this Agreement. Buyer shall
retain and shall have the right to subtract from the Holdback Amount (x) the
amount, if any, to which Buyer is determined to be entitled pursuant to
Section 2.4(f) and (y) any and all Losses for which any Buyer Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII. To the extent
any portion of the Holdback Amount is available to satisfy indemnification
claims under this Article VIII, the Buyer shall use the Holdback Amount to
satisfy such claims prior to pursuing amounts directly from the Seller
Parties. Buyer shall pay the balance of the Holdback Amount to the Company
(for the benefit of the Sellers) on two release dates (each a "Release Date")
as follows:

(i) On the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "12-Month
Anniversary"), Buyer shall pay to the Company (for the benefit of the Sellers)
an aggregate amount equal to (A) $20,000,000, minus (B) the amount, if any,
subtracted by Buyer from the Holdback Amount pursuant to Section 2.4(f), minus
(C) the amount of all Losses that have been subtracted by Buyer from the
Holdback Amount pursuant to Article VIII as of such date (subject to the
provisions of Section 8.4), minus (D) any amounts described in Section
8.5(a)(iii) below.

(ii) On the 36-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "36-Month
Anniversary"), Buyer shall pay to the Company (for the benefit of the Sellers)
an aggregate amount equal to (A) the remaining balance, if any, of the
Holdback Amount, minus (B) the amount of all Losses that have been subtracted
by Buyer from the Holdback Amount pursuant to Article VIII as of such date
(subject to the provisions of Section 8.4) to the extent such Losses (i) were
not taken into account when calculating the distribution of Holdback Amount
pursuant to Section 8.5(a)(i) or (ii) were taken into account when calculating
the distribution of Holdback Amount pursuant to Section 8.5(a)(i) and would
have caused such distribution to be less than zero, minus (C) any amounts
described in Section 8.5(a)(iii) below.

(iii) To the extent that as of the 12-Month Anniversary or the 36-Month
Anniversary (1) there are claims properly and timely made by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for indemnification against the Seller Parties pursuant to
Article VIII pending, (2) any Seller Party's obligations under this Agreement
has been breached or has not been performed, or (3) Buyer has determined
(based on the operations of the Business prior to Closing, the Tax Returns
filed with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods (as well as
any other information provided by the Seller or otherwise available to the
Buyer)) (x) that sales and use Taxes that were required to have been paid by
the Company, On-Site Labs, or DepositIQ (or otherwise in connection with the
Business) in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or, solely with respect to
the Company, a Straddle Period and (y) that such sales and use Taxes have not
been paid in full, Buyer shall retain from the payment of the Holdback Amount
only that portion that constitutes the Claimed Losses (as any such estimated
Claimed Losses may be reasonably updated by the Buyer as of any Release Date;
provided, in the event of such an update, Buyer shall provide to the Sellers
Representative reasonable supporting documentation in the Buyer Parties'
possession or reasonably available to the Buyer Parties) and (in the case of
any unpaid sales or use Taxes described in (3) above) 

the estimated amount of future Claimed Losses that would arise if such Taxes
were imposed on the Buyer immediately prior to the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations, and shall release to the Company (for the
benefit of the Sellers) the balance of the applicable Holdback Amount, to
cover potential costs, expenses or damages to be incurred by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, as determined by Buyer in the reasonable exercise of its
discretion, until such time as such claims have been dismissed, adjudicated or
settled, or such breaches have been cured or compensated, or (in the case of
any unpaid sales or use Taxes described in (3) above) the applicable statute
of limitations with respect to such unpaid sales or use Taxes has expired, as
applicable.

Section 8.6 Limits on Indemnification.

(a) Subject to Section 8.6(f), the Seller Parties shall not be liable for any
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) unless and until the
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the
Seller Parties equals or exceeds $1,500,000 (the "Deductible"), in which case
the Seller Parties shall be liable for the amount of such Losses in excess of
the Deductible, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section.

(b) Subject to Section 8.6(f), the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable
Losses which may be recovered from the Seller Parties arising out of or
relating to the causes set forth in Section 8.2(a) shall be an amount equal to
the Holdback Amount (the "Cap"), which shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any such Losses except for (i) the rights of the
parties hereto pursuant to Section 10.11 and (ii) claims grounded in fraud.

(c) Other than claims grounded in fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the
amount in respect of which any Seller Owner shall be liable for
indemnification under Section 8.2 (other than Section 8.2(c)) shall not exceed
the gross proceeds attributable (based on the portion of the Purchase Price
allocable to such Seller Owner as a result of such Seller Owner's ownership of
the Company) to such Seller Owner and its Affiliates.

(d) Other than claims grounded in fraud o intentional misrepresentation, the
maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from
the Seller Owners arising out of or relating to the causes set forth in
Section 8.2(c) as a result of a breach by a Specified Seller Owner shall be an
amount equal to $50,000,000; provided, however, that this Section 8.6(b) shall
not operate to limit the indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from any
Specified Seller Owner as a result of a breach of its own Significant Owner
Agreement.

(e) The Seller Parties shall not be obligated to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or any other Person with respect to any Loss to the extent
that a specific accrual or reserve for the amount of such Loss was taken into
account in calculating the Net Adjustment Amount or if such Loss was taken
into account in calculating the Revenue True-Up Amount.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to Losses arising out of or relating to
the inaccuracy or breach of any Fundamental Representation, any representation
or warranty set forth in Section 3.16 relating to Taxes, or to any
representation or warranty in the event of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation. In addition, the Deductible shall not apply to Losses
arising out of or relating to the inaccuracy or breach of the representation
and warranty set forth in Section 3.7(e).

(g) No party hereto shall have any liability to any other party under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby for any consequential damages or punitive
damages (other than (i) natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable
consequential damages or (ii) consequential or punitive damages payable to a
third party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim).

(h) For purposes of calculating the amount of any Loss arising from a breach
of any representation or warranty subject to indemnification under Section
8.2(a), all "material," "materially," "in all material respects," "Material
Adverse Effect," and other like qualifications shall be disregarded. For
purposes of determining 

whether there has been a breach of any such representation or warranty, all
"material," "materially," "in all material respects," "Material Adverse
Effect," and other like qualifications shall be respected.

(i) The parties agree to treat any amounts payable pursuant to this Article
VIII as an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes to the extent
permitted by Law.

(j) Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
seek recovery under any insurance policy that would reasonably be expected to
be available to reimburse any Losses. The amount of any indemnifiable Losses
shall be net of any amounts actually received by the Indemnified Party under
insurance policies, indemnities, reimbursement arrangements, or contracts
(including with respect to any breaches thereof) pursuant to which or under
which such Person or such Person's Affiliates is a party or has rights with
respect to such Losses. If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an
Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses pursuant to this Agreement and
subsequently recovers all or a part of such Losses from a third party under
any insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement, or contract, such
payment from the third party shall be distributed: (i) first, to the
Indemnified Party in the amount of any deductible or similar amount required
to be paid by the Indemnified Party in connection with such insurance policy,
indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or contract, plus reasonable attorney's
fees and other expenses incurred in connection with such recovery, (ii)
second, to the Indemnifying Party the amount paid to the Indemnified Party by
the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Losses, and (iii) the balance, if
any, to the Indemnified Party. No payment shall be due under this Section to
the Indemnifying Party to the extent that the Losses with respect to which the
payment was received from the third party were determined net of insurance or
other recoveries pursuant to this Section.

(k) Exclusive Remedy. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, following
the Closing, the indemnification provisions of Article VIII shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies of the parties hereto with respect to or in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement or otherwise by any
party, or any failure by any party to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or complied with,
under this Agreement, regardless of the applicable Law or legal theory under
which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether
sounding in contract, tort or equity, except (i) the rights of the parties
hereto pursuant to Section 10.11, (ii) claims grounded in fraud, and (iii)
claims based on the purchase price adjustment provisions included in Article
II. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Indemnifying shall not be liable for any Losses to an Indemnified Party,
including by means of indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3,
to the extent such liability or obligation is directly attributable to any
willful misconduct of any Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section
8.6, together with the provisions of Section 8.1, were specifically bargained-
for between Buyer and the Sellers and were taken into account by the Sellers
in arriving at the Purchase Price and agreeing to enter into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Sellers have specifically relied upon the
provisions of Section 8.1 and Section 8.6, in agreeing to the Purchase Price
and in agreeing to provide the specific representations, warranties, covenants
and indemnities set forth herein.

(l) No Duplication. This Agreement shall not permit duplicative
indemnification in respect of the same Losses or any component thereof if more
than one provision of this Agreement gives rise to an indemnification
obligation with respect to the same Losses.

nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person other than the parties and their respective successors and

to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in
Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice
as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the
parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of
the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for
any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction

such courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that disputes
with respect to the matters referenced in Section 2.4 shall be resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm as provided therein.

Section 10.10 Assignment; Successors. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by either
party without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
provided, however, the Buyer may assign its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to any Affiliate of the Buyer without the prior consent
of the Sellers Representative; provided further, that no assignment shall
limit the assignor's obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.11 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, each of the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of
the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, provided, that if
jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, then in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at
law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in
any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(b) any requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief. 

Section 10.12 Currency. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is
the currency used for all purposes in this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement.

Section 10.13 Severability. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be
interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law. In case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision or provisions shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, and the remainder
of the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 10.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party.

Section 10.16 Facsimile or .pdf Signature. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile or .pdf signature and a facsimile or .pdf signature shall constitute
an original for all purposes.

Section 10.17 Time of Essence. Time is of the essence with regard to all dates
and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

Section 10.18 No Presumption Against Drafting Party. Each Buyer Party and each
Seller Party acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by legal counsel (or has had the opportunity to be represented by
legal counsel, and decided not to engage legal counsel) in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would require
interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the
drafting party has no application and is expressly waived.

Section 10.19 Attorney-Client Matters.

(a) Each Seller Party acknowledges and agrees that Procopio has represented
only the Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that Procopio has not represented the interests of any Seller
Owner.

(b) Parent, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties,
agrees that, following the Closing, Procopio may serve as counsel to any of
the Seller Parties, the Sellers Representative and/or their respective
Affiliates, in connection with any and all matters, to the extent related to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding the representation by
Procopio of the Sellers prior to the Closing Date. Parent (on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates) hereby (i) waives any claim it has or may have that
Procopio has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging
in any such representation and (ii) agrees that, in the event that a dispute
arises after the Closing between any Buyer Party, or any indemnitee under this
Agreement, or any Affiliate of Buyer, on the one hand, and any of the Seller
Parties, the Sellers Representative or any of their Affiliates, 

on the other hand, Procopio may represent any of the Seller Parties, the
Sellers Representative or any of their Affiliates in such dispute even though
the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to the Buyer Parties
or Buyer's Affiliates.

(c) Parent (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) also further agree that,
as to all confidential communications among Procopio and the Seller Parties
and the Sellers Representative, or such parties' Affiliates and
Representatives, that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including, without limitation, the negotiation, documentation
and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
pre-Closing dispute arising under this Agreement), the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Seller
Parties and the Sellers Representative, as applicable, and may be controlled
by the Seller Parties and the Sellers Representative, as applicable, and shall
not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer Parties or their Affiliates; provided,
however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Procopio shall not disclose any
such attorney-client communications to any third parties (other than
representatives, accountants and advisors of the Seller Parties or Sellers
Representative who agree to maintain the confidence of such attorney-client
communications).
