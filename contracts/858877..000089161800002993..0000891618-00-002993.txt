Dear ArrowPoint Stockholders:


     On behalf of the ArrowPoint board of directors, I am pleased to forward the
enclosed proxy statement/prospectus regarding an opportunity for ArrowPoint to
merge with Cisco Systems, Inc. We believe the merger will strengthen the
combined company's product offerings, competitive position, management depth and
research and development capabilities while offering significant value to our
stockholders.



     If the merger with Cisco is approved, each share of your ArrowPoint common
stock will be exchanged for 2.1218 shares of Cisco common stock. Cisco common
stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol "CSCO,"
and on May 19, 2000, Cisco common stock closed at $          per share.



     Before we can merge, those holding a majority of ArrowPoint's outstanding
common stock must vote to adopt the merger agreement. The merger proposal will
be voted on at a special meeting of ArrowPoint stockholders on Friday, June 23,
2000 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, at the offices of Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State
Street, 26th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts. Only those who hold shares of our
common stock at the close of business on Friday, May 19, 2000 will be entitled
to vote at the special meeting.


     The ArrowPoint board of directors has carefully considered the terms and
conditions of the merger and agrees that the terms are fair to, and in the best
interests of, our stockholders. The board of directors has approved the merger
agreement and merger and recommends that you vote FOR the adoption of the merger
agreement.

     This proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information
concerning Cisco and the merger. Please give all of the information in the proxy
statement/prospectus your careful attention. IN PARTICULAR, YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY
CONSIDER THE DISCUSSION IN THE SECTION ENTITLED "RISK FACTORS" BEGINNING ON PAGE
14.

     YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. To adopt the merger agreement, you MUST VOTE
FOR the proposal by following the instructions stated on the enclosed proxy
card. If you attend the special meeting, you may vote in person if you wish,
even though you have previously returned your proxy.

     Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, PLEASE COMPLETE,
SIGN, DATE AND PROMPTLY RETURN YOUR PROXY CARD IN THE ENCLOSED POSTAGE-PAID
ENVELOPE. If you do not vote at all, it will, in effect, count as a vote against
the proposal.

     On behalf of the ArrowPoint board of directors, I thank you for your
support and urge you to VOTE FOR ADOPTION of the merger agreement between
ArrowPoint Communications, Inc. and Cisco Systems, Inc.

                                          Sincerely,

                                          /s/ CHIN-CHENG WU

            QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ARROWPOINT/CISCO MERGER

Q: WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN THE MERGER?


A: If the merger is completed, you will receive 2.1218 shares of Cisco common
   stock for each share of ArrowPoint common stock you own. Cisco will not issue
   fractional shares of common stock. You will receive cash based on the market
   price of Cisco common stock instead of any fractional share. Cisco common
   stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the trading symbol
   "CSCO," and on May 19, 2000, Cisco common stock closed at $       per share.
   Because the exchange ratio is fixed at 2.1218 but the market price of Cisco
   common stock is subject to fluctuation, the market value of the shares of
   Cisco common stock that you will receive in the merger may increase or
   decrease prior to and following the merger. We urge you to obtain current
   market quotations for Cisco common stock and ArrowPoint common stock.


Q: WHEN WILL THE MERGER BE COMPLETED?

A: We hope to complete the merger by the end of June 2000. Because the merger is
   subject to governmental approvals, however, we cannot predict the exact
   timing.

Q: SHOULD I SEND IN MY STOCK CERTIFICATES NOW?

A: No. After we complete the merger, Cisco will send instructions to you
   explaining how to exchange your shares of ArrowPoint common stock for the
   appropriate number of shares of Cisco common stock.

Q: HOW DO I VOTE?

A: Mail your signed proxy card in the enclosed return envelope as soon as
   possible so that your shares may be represented at the special meeting. If
   your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, your broker will vote
   your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should
   follow the directions provided by your broker regarding how to instruct your
   broker to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be
   voted at the special meeting and it will have the same effect as voting
   against approval of the merger agreement.

Q: HOW CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE MAILED MY PROXY?

A: You may change your vote by delivering a signed notice of revocation or a
   subsequently dated, signed proxy card to ArrowPoint's corporate secretary
   before the stockholder meeting, or by attending the stockholder meeting and
   voting in person.

Q: WHOM CAN I CALL WITH QUESTIONS?

A: If you have any questions about the merger, please call ArrowPoint Investor
   Relations at (978) 206-3000.

content or transaction requested and the structure and changing conditions of
the customer's Web network.

     ArrowPoint's intelligent Web switches enable its customers to deploy a Web
network architecture that:

     - facilitates e-commerce transactions;

     - gives preferred or differing treatment to specific users or specific
       types of content requests;

     - directs Web requests to the network server best able to handle those
       requests based on information about the requesting party, the Web content
       or transaction requested and the customer's Web network;

     - identifies hot content, such as a breaking news story, and automatically
       triggers the copying of that content to dynamically add capacity to
       handle the requests for that content;

     - intelligently redirects requests for content or applications unavailable
       due to a Web site failure to another Web site or server which has the
       requested information;

     - protects against attempts by computer hackers to disable servers or keep
       servers busy performing useless tasks without significantly impairing
       performance;

     - addresses a range of customer needs, from those of smaller Web sites to
       the high-performance demands of large, complex Web hosting operations;
       and

     The company was founded in 1984 by a small group of computer scientists
from Stanford University seeking an easier way to connect different types of
computer systems. Cisco Systems shipped its first product in 1986. Since then,

in more than 200 offices in 60 countries.

STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF ARROWPOINT COMMON STOCK (SEE PAGE 37)

     ArrowPoint and Cisco have entered into a merger agreement that provides for
the merger of ArrowPoint and Archer Acquisition Corporation, a newly formed
wholly-owned subsidiary of Cisco. Following the merger, ArrowPoint will continue
its operations as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cisco and stockholders of
ArrowPoint will become stockholders of Cisco. Each share of ArrowPoint common
stock will be exchanged for 2.1218 shares of Cisco common stock. A corresponding
right to purchase shares of Cisco Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock,
no par value, pursuant to the Cisco Rights Agreement dated as of June 30, 1998
between Cisco and BankBoston, N.A. will accompany each share of Cisco common
stock. We urge you to read the merger agreement, which is attached as Appendix A
to this proxy statement/prospectus, carefully and in its entirety.

VOTE REQUIRED FOR STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL (SEE PAGE 23)

     The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ArrowPoint common
stock must adopt the merger agreement. Cisco stockholders are not required to
approve the merger agreement and will not vote on the merger.


     You are entitled to cast one vote per share of ArrowPoint common stock you
owned as of May 19, 2000, the record date.


RECOMMENDATION OF ARROWPOINT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (SEE PAGES 23 AND 28)

     After careful consideration, ArrowPoint's board of directors has approved
the merger agreement and determined that the merger is advisable and in the best
interest of ArrowPoint and its stockholders and recommends that ArrowPoint
stockholders vote FOR adoption of the merger agreement.

<PAGE>   9

OPINION OF ARROWPOINT'S FINANCIAL ADVISOR (SEE PAGE 29)

     Goldman, Sachs & Co., ArrowPoint's financial advisor, delivered an opinion
to the ArrowPoint board of directors that, as of the date of the opinion and
based on the procedures followed, factors considered and assumptions made by
Goldman, Sachs, and subject to the limitations set forth in the opinion, the
exchange ratio in the merger agreement was fair to the stockholders from a
financial point of view. The complete opinion of Goldman, Sachs is attached as
Appendix D to this proxy statement/prospectus. We urge you to read it in its
entirety.

CONDITIONS TO COMPLETION OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 44)

     Cisco's and ArrowPoint's respective obligations to complete the merger are
subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. If either
Cisco or ArrowPoint waives any conditions, ArrowPoint will consider the facts
and circumstances at that time and make a determination as to whether a
resolicitation of proxies from ArrowPoint stockholders is appropriate. The
following conditions, among others, must be satisfied or waived before
completion of the merger:

     - the merger agreement must be adopted by ArrowPoint stockholders;

     - no law, regulation or order which makes completion of the merger illegal
       may be enacted or issued;

     - all necessary governmental approvals must be obtained, including such
       waivers required under United States antitrust laws and federal and state
       securities laws;

     - no injunction or order preventing consummation of the merger or
       restricting Cisco's operation of ArrowPoint after the merger may be in
       effect;

     - Cisco's and ArrowPoint's respective representations and warranties in the
       merger agreement must be true and correct except where the failure to be
       so true and correct would not have a material adverse effect;

     - Cisco and ArrowPoint must comply with their respective agreements in the
       merger agreement;

     - Cisco and ArrowPoint must receive an opinion of tax counsel to the effect
       that the merger will qualify as a reorganization;

     - Cisco must be advised by its independent accountants that pooling of
       interests accounting is appropriate for the merger and ArrowPoint must be
       advised by its independent accountants that it qualifies as a combining
       company in a pooling of interests business combination;

     - ArrowPoint must obtain all necessary third-party consents required under
       its material contracts;

     - certain employees of ArrowPoint must have entered into employment and
       non-competition agreements with Cisco; and

     - the shares of Cisco common stock to be issued to ArrowPoint stockholders
       in the merger must be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq National
       Market.

TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT (SEE PAGE 45)

     The merger agreement may be terminated before the completion of the merger
by the mutual consent of both parties or by either Cisco or ArrowPoint if:

     - the conditions to completion of the merger would not be satisfied because
       of either a breach of an agreement in the merger agreement by the other
       or a breach of a representation, warranty or
                                        3
<PAGE>   10

       obligation of the other in the merger agreement, either of which is not
       cured within ten business days of receipt of written notice of such
       breach;

     - the merger is not completed, without the fault of the terminating party,
       by October 31, 2000 (or, under certain circumstances, December 31, 2000);

     - a final court order prohibiting the merger is issued and is not
       appealable; or

     - the ArrowPoint stockholders do not approve the merger agreement at the
       special meeting.

     In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated by Cisco if the
ArrowPoint board of directors takes any of the following actions:

     - withdraws or modifies its recommendation that ArrowPoint stockholders
       adopt the merger agreement in a manner adverse to Cisco, or resolves to
       do so;

     - fails to comply with the nonsolicitation provisions contained in the
       merger agreement, which provisions are summarized below and discussed in
       detail on page 43 of this proxy statement/ prospectus;

     - fails to call and hold the special meeting by September 30, 2000 (or
       December 15, 2000 under certain circumstances); or


     - with respect to an extraordinary transaction of the nature specified in
       the merger agreement, such as a merger or a sale of significant assets,
       involving ArrowPoint and a party other than Cisco, if the ArrowPoint
       board of directors does not reconfirm its approval and recommendation of
       the merger agreement and does not reject the other extraordinary
       transaction within ten business days.


PAYMENT OF TERMINATION FEE (SEE PAGE 46)

     ArrowPoint has agreed to pay Cisco a termination fee of $150 million or
reimburse Cisco for its out-of-pocket expenses if the merger agreement is
terminated under circumstances which are described on page 46 of this proxy
statement/prospectus under the heading "Payment of Fees and Expenses."

NO OTHER TAKEOVER NEGOTIATIONS INVOLVING ARROWPOINT (SEE PAGE 43)

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated, or
unless Cisco consents in writing, ArrowPoint has agreed not to directly or
indirectly take any of the following actions:

     - solicit, initiate, encourage or agree to any takeover proposal; or

     - engage in negotiations with, or disclose any nonpublic information
       relating to ArrowPoint or any of its subsidiaries to, or afford access to
       the properties, books or records of, ArrowPoint or any of its
       subsidiaries to, any person that has advised ArrowPoint that it may be
       considering making, or that has made, a takeover proposal.

     ArrowPoint's board of directors is not prohibited from taking and
disclosing to the ArrowPoint stockholders a position with respect to a tender
offer pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Additionally, the ArrowPoint board of directors is not
prohibited from providing a copy of the non-solicitation provision of the merger
agreement to any third party.

     ArrowPoint has agreed to provide Cisco with detailed information about any
takeover proposal it receives.
                                        4
<PAGE>   11


     ArrowPoint may engage in any of these otherwise prohibited acts, other than
solicitation, initiation or encouragement of any takeover proposal, if its board
of directors:



     - believes in good faith that a particular proposal will result in a
       transaction more favorable than the merger to the ArrowPoint stockholders
       from a financial point of view; and



     - determines in good faith after advice from outside legal counsel that
       engaging in the prohibited negotiations or discussions or providing
       non-public information is necessary in order to comply with the fiduciary
       duties of the board under applicable law.


     A takeover proposal is:

     - any offer or proposal for a merger or other business combination
       involving ArrowPoint or any of its subsidiaries;

     - the acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock
       of ArrowPoint or any of its subsidiaries; or

     - the sale or transfer of any significant portion of the assets of
       ArrowPoint or any of its subsidiaries, other than the merger.

ARROWPOINT HAS ENTERED INTO A STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT THAT MAY DISCOURAGE THIRD
PARTIES THAT MAY BE INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING A STAKE IN ARROWPOINT AND IF THE
MERGER IS NOT COMPLETED, MAY PREVENT ARROWPOINT FROM QUALIFYING AS A COMBINING
COMPANY IN A POOLING OF INTERESTS BUSINESS COMBINATION IN THE FUTURE (SEE PAGE
48)


     ArrowPoint entered into a stock option agreement with Cisco that granted
Cisco the option to buy up to 6,974,047 shares of ArrowPoint common stock, which
represented approximately 19.9% of the shares of ArrowPoint common stock
outstanding on May 4, 2000, or approximately 16.6% after issuance of the shares
of ArrowPoint common stock subject to the option. The exercise price of the
option is $135 per share.


     Cisco required ArrowPoint to grant the option as a prerequisite to entering
into the merger agreement. The option may discourage third parties who are
interested in acquiring a significant stake in ArrowPoint and is intended by
Cisco to increase the likelihood that the merger will be completed.

     The option is not currently exercisable and Cisco may only exercise the
option if the merger agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the
termination fee is payable or prior to an extraordinary transaction of the
nature specified in the merger agreement which obligates ArrowPoint to pay the
termination fee. Otherwise, the option will terminate and may not be exercised
by Cisco.

     We urge you to read the stock option agreement attached as Appendix B to
this proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety.

STOCKHOLDERS HOLDING APPROXIMATELY 38% OF ARROWPOINT'S COMMON STOCK HAVE ENTERED
INTO STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS REQUIRING THEM TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE MERGER (SEE
PAGE 47)

     In connection with the execution of the merger agreement various funds
associated with Matrix Partners and North Bridge Venture Partners have entered
into stockholder agreements with Cisco. The stockholder agreements require these
ArrowPoint stockholders to vote all shares of ArrowPoint common stock
beneficially owned by them in favor of approval of the merger agreement. The
stockholder agreements also required the stockholders to deliver an irrevocable
proxy to Cisco. The irrevocable proxy enables Cisco to vote the stockholders'
shares to approve the merger. These ArrowPoint stockholders were not paid
additional consideration in connection with the stockholder agreements.
                                        5
<PAGE>   12


     The shares of ArrowPoint Common Stock subject to the stockholder agreements
collectively represent approximately 38% of the outstanding ArrowPoint common
stock as of May 19, 2000 the record date.


     We urge you to read the form of stockholder agreement attached as Appendix
C to this proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety.

INTERESTS OF ARROWPOINT'S DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND AFFILIATES IN THE MERGER (SEE
PAGE 51)


     When considering the recommendation of the ArrowPoint board of directors,
you should be aware that certain ArrowPoint directors and officers have
interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, yours. As a
result, ArrowPoint's directors and officers may be more likely to vote to
approve the merger than ArrowPoint stockholders generally. These interests
include the following:


     - As of March 31, 2000, directors and executive officers of ArrowPoint and
       their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 52.0% of the
       outstanding shares of ArrowPoint common stock.

     - As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, non-employee directors
       of ArrowPoint beneficially owned stock options to purchase an aggregate
       of 60,000 shares of ArrowPoint common stock, all of which were unvested.
       If the merger is completed, 50% of the unvested options having an
       exercise price of $34.00 per share will accelerate and become fully
       vested and exercisable.

     - Stock options granted by ArrowPoint under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan
       provide for the acceleration of 50% of the unvested portion of each
       option if the merger is completed. As of the date of this proxy
       statement/prospectus approximately 394,967 unvested stock options granted
       to executive officers (including employee directors) of ArrowPoint will
       vest upon completion of the merger in accordance with these provisions.

     - Grants of restricted stock made by ArrowPoint under the 1997 Stock
       Incentive Plan and subject to stock restriction agreements provide for
       the acceleration of 50% of the unvested shares if the merger is
       completed. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus
       approximately 881,500 unvested shares granted to executive officers
       (including employee directors) will vest upon completion of the merger.

     - Several employees and executive officers, as a condition to closing of
       the merger, are required to enter into employment and non-competition
       agreements with Cisco that will become effective upon completion of the
       merger.


     - Cisco has agreed to indemnify each present and former ArrowPoint officer
       and director against liabilities arising out of the fact that such person
       is or was a director or officer of ArrowPoint.


U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 53)


     We have structured the merger so that, in general, ArrowPoint stockholders
will not recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in
the merger, except for taxes payable because of cash received by ArrowPoint
stockholders instead of fractional shares. It is a condition to the merger that
both Cisco and ArrowPoint receive legal opinions to the effect that the merger
constitutes a reorganization within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code.


ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 54)

     We intend to account for the merger as a pooling of interests business
combination. It is a condition to completion of the merger that Cisco be advised
in writing by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that the merger can properly be
accounted for as a pooling of interests business combination, although
                                        6
<PAGE>   13

this condition may be waived. It is also a condition to completion of the merger
that ArrowPoint shall be advised by Arthur Andersen LLP that it qualifies as a
combining company in a pooling of interests business combination.

ANTITRUST APPROVAL REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE MERGER (SEE PAGE 52)


     The merger is subject to United States antitrust laws. We have made the
required filings with the United States Department of Justice and the Federal
Trade Commission. However, we are not permitted to complete the merger until the
applicable waiting period has expired or terminated.


     In addition, Cisco and ArrowPoint may need to obtain approval for the
merger in foreign jurisdictions depending upon the extent that ArrowPoint
conducts business in these jurisdictions and the statutory requirements of each
of these jurisdictions.


RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY TO SELL CISCO STOCK (SEE PAGE 54)


     All shares of Cisco common stock received by you in connection with the
merger will be freely transferable unless you are considered an "affiliate" of
either ArrowPoint or Cisco for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933. Shares of
Cisco common stock held by these affiliates may only be sold pursuant to a
registration statement or exemption under the Securities Act.

YOU DO NOT HAVE DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS (SEE PAGE 54)

     Under Delaware law, you are not entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights
in the merger.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT-PROSPECTUS

     This proxy statement/prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference

30, 1995, July 28, 1996, July 26, 1997, July 25, 1998, and July 31, 1999 has
been derived from its consolidated financial statements and related notes
thereto incorporated herein by reference. Cisco's historical figures as of and

consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair
presentation of the results of operations for all periods presented.

     ArrowPoint's summary financial data as of and for the period since its

A. The ArrowPoint financial information presented has been derived from its
   financial statements; however, the periods shown above are presented to
   conform more closely with Cisco's fiscal year-end rather than the historical
   presentation of ArrowPoint's fiscal year-end at December 31.

 B. The pro forma combined per share information combines financial information
    of Cisco for the fiscal years ended July 26, 1997, July 25, 1998 and July
    31, 1999 and the six months ended January 23, 1999 and January 29, 2000 with
    the financial information of ArrowPoint for the period from inception (April
    14, 1997) to June 30, 1997 and the twelve months ended June 30, 1998 and
    1999 and the six months ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively. This
    information also
                                       10
<PAGE>   17

    assumes the merger occurred as of the beginning of the earliest period
    presented and was accounted for as a pooling of interests.

 C. The unaudited equivalent ArrowPoint pro forma per share amounts are
    calculated by multiplying the Cisco combined pro forma per share amounts by
    the exchange ratio.

D. Historical book value per share is computed by dividing stockholders' equity
   by the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the end of each
   period. Pro forma book value per share is computed by dividing pro forma
   stockholders' equity by the pro forma number of shares of common stock
   outstanding at the end of the period.

 E. All share and per share information assumes that ArrowPoint's preferred
    stock was converted into common stock at the beginning of the earliest
    period presented.

 F. The pro forma financial information includes adjustments to record the tax
    benefit from net operating loss carryforwards in the periods which they were
    generated. These amounts reflect the impact of the reversal of valuation
    allowances realized in the historical financial statements of ArrowPoint
    which would not have been present had the companies always been combined
    historically.

G. ArrowPoint was incorporated on April 14, 1997 (date of inception).

RECENT CLOSING PRICES


     As of May 4, 2000, the last trading day before announcement of the proposed
merger, the closing prices per share of Cisco common stock and ArrowPoint common
stock on the Nasdaq National Market were $63.625 and $134.8125, respectively. On
May 19, 2000, the latest practicable trading day before the printing of this
proxy statement/prospectus, the closing prices per share of Cisco common stock
and ArrowPoint common stock on the Nasdaq National Market were $     and $     ,
respectively. The equivalent per share prices for ArrowPoint common stock based
on the Cisco common stock prices multiplied by the exchange ratio of 2.1218 were
$134.999 as of May 4, 2000 and $     as of May 19, 2000.


     Because the exchange ratio is fixed at 2.1218 but the market price of Cisco
common stock is subject to fluctuation, the market value of the shares of Cisco
common stock that holders of ArrowPoint common stock will receive in the merger
may increase or decrease prior to and following the merger. WE URGE YOU TO
OBTAIN CURRENT MARKET QUOTATIONS FOR CISCO COMMON STOCK AND ARROWPOINT COMMON
STOCK. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN AS TO THE FUTURE PRICES OR MARKETS FOR CISCO
COMMON STOCK OR ARROWPOINT COMMON STOCK.

NUMBER OF ARROWPOINT STOCKHOLDERS


     As of May 19, 2000, there were approximately      stockholders of record
who held shares of ArrowPoint common stock, as shown on the records of
ArrowPoint's transfer agent for such shares.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     By voting in favor of the merger, you will be choosing to invest in Cisco
common stock. An investment in Cisco common stock involves a high degree of
risk. In addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, you should carefully consider
the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote for the merger.

                          RISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER

YOU WILL RECEIVE 2.1218 SHARES OF CISCO COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF
ARROWPOINT COMMON STOCK OWNED DESPITE CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE OF ARROWPOINT
COMMON STOCK OR CISCO COMMON STOCK.

     Upon completion of the merger, each share of ArrowPoint common stock will
be exchanged for 2.1218 shares of Cisco common stock. There will be no
adjustment for changes in the market price of either ArrowPoint common stock or
Cisco common stock. ArrowPoint and Cisco are not permitted to abandon the merger
nor is ArrowPoint permitted to resolicit the vote of its stockholders solely
because of changes in the market price of Cisco common stock. Accordingly, the
specific dollar value of Cisco common stock to be received by you upon
completion of the merger will depend on the market value of Cisco common stock
at the time of completion of the merger. The share price of Cisco common stock
is by nature subject to the general price fluctuations in the market for
publicly traded equity securities and has experienced significant volatility. No
prediction can be made as to the market price of Cisco common stock at the
completion of the merger or as to the market price of Cisco common stock after
the completion of the merger.

ALTHOUGH CISCO AND ARROWPOINT EXPECT THAT THE MERGER WILL RESULT IN BENEFITS,
THOSE BENEFITS MAY NOT BE REALIZED.

     Cisco and ArrowPoint entered into the merger agreement with the expectation
that the merger will result in benefits, including the ability to:

     - strengthen Cisco's abilities to offer its customers a broad portfolio of
       content networking solutions;

     - enhance Cisco's capabilities immediately in software and hardware-based
       content switching products that optimize the delivery of Web content; and

     - leverage ArrowPoint's sales and support organizations focused on
       delivering content switching solutions.

     Achieving the benefits of the merger will depend in part on the integration
of the technology, operations and personnel of the two companies in a timely and
efficient manner so as to minimize the risk that the merger will result in the
loss of customers or key employees or the continued diversion of the attention
of management.

     In addition, the combined entity may not fully increase efficiencies from
the transaction. ArrowPoint's product line consists of content smart Web
switches. Integrating ArrowPoint's product sales into Cisco's business model
will involve risks that may jeopardize the success of the merged company. The
ArrowPoint technology and products address a new market for Cisco, namely the
content smart switching market. For merger-related efficiencies to be realized,
Cisco will have to learn to satisfy the needs of ArrowPoint's customers in a
timely and efficient manner. ArrowPoint's content smart switching products are
new products for Cisco. In order for the merger to be successful, Cisco and
ArrowPoint may need to integrate ArrowPoint's products and technologies with
other Cisco products

                                       14
<PAGE>   21

and platforms. This integration will involve considerable technology and
execution risk and may or may not be successful. We cannot assure you that Cisco
and ArrowPoint will be successfully integrated or that any of the anticipated
benefits will be realized, and failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on Cisco's business, financial condition and operating results.

ARROWPOINT OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT MAY INFLUENCE
THEM TO SUPPORT OR APPROVE THE MERGER.

     The directors and officers of ArrowPoint participate in arrangements and
have continuing indemnification against liabilities that provide them with
interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, yours
including the following:

     - Stock options granted by ArrowPoint under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan
       provide for the acceleration of 50% of the unvested portion of each
       option if the merger is completed. As of the date of this proxy
       statement/prospectus approximately 394,967 unvested stock options granted
       to executive officers (including employee directors) of ArrowPoint will
       vest upon completion of the merger in accordance with these provisions.

     - Grants of restricted stock made by ArrowPoint under the 1997 Stock
       Incentive Plan and subject to stock restriction agreements provide for
       the acceleration of 50% of the unvested shares if the merger is
       completed. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus
       approximately 881,500 unvested shares granted to executive officers
       (including employee directors) will vest upon completion of the merger.

     - Stock options granted by ArrowPoint under the 2000 Non-Employee Director
       Stock Option Plan provide for the acceleration of 50% of the unvested
       portion of each option if the merger is completed. As of the date of this
       proxy statement/prospectus, 30,000 unvested options granted to
       non-employee directors will vest upon completion of the merger.

     Several employees and executive officers, as a condition to closing the
merger, are required to enter into employment and non-competition agreements
with Cisco that will become effective upon completion of the merger. Please see
summary of the terms of their employment agreements in the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "Employment and Non-Competition Agreements" under
"Related Agreements" on page 47 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

     Furthermore, Cisco has agreed to indemnify each present and former
ArrowPoint director and officer against liabilities arising out of the fact that
such person is or was a director or officer.

     As a result, these directors and officers could be more likely to vote to
approve the merger agreement than if they did not hold these interests.
ArrowPoint stockholders should consider whether these interests may have
influenced these directors and officers to support or recommend the merger.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MERGER COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ARROWPOINT'S STOCK PRICE
AND FUTURE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

     If the merger is not completed for any reason, ArrowPoint may be subject to
a number of material risks, including the following:

     - ArrowPoint may be required to pay Cisco a termination fee of $150 million
       or reimburse Cisco for expenses;

     - ArrowPoint stockholders may experience dilution to their stock ownership
       because the stock option granted to Cisco by ArrowPoint may become
       exercisable;

     - ArrowPoint may no longer qualify as an entity that may be a party to a
       business combination for which pooling of interests accounting would be
       available;

                                       15
<PAGE>   22

     - the price of ArrowPoint common stock may decline to the extent that the
       current market price of ArrowPoint common stock reflects a market
       assumption that the merger will be completed; and

     - costs related to the merger, such as legal, accounting and financial
       advisor fees, must be paid even if the merger is not completed.

     In addition, ArrowPoint customers may, in response to the announcement of
the merger, delay or defer purchasing decisions. Any delay or deferral in
purchasing decisions by ArrowPoint customers could have a material adverse
effect on ArrowPoint's business, regardless of whether or not the merger is
ultimately completed. Similarly, current and prospective ArrowPoint employees
may experience uncertainty about their future role with Cisco until Cisco's
strategies with regard to ArrowPoint are announced or executed. This may
adversely affect ArrowPoint's ability to attract and retain key management,
sales, marketing and technical personnel.

     Further, if the merger is terminated and ArrowPoint's board of directors
determines to seek another merger or business combination, there can be no
assurance that it will be able to find a partner willing to pay an equivalent or
more attractive price than that which would be paid in the merger. In addition,
while the merger agreement is in effect and subject to certain limited
exceptions described on page 43 of this proxy statement/prospectus, ArrowPoint
is prohibited from soliciting, initiating or encouraging or entering into
certain extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets or other
business combination, with any party other than Cisco.

UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER MAY CAUSE ARROWPOINT TO LOSE KEY
PERSONNEL.

     Current and prospective ArrowPoint employees may experience uncertainty
about their future as employees of Cisco. This uncertainty may adversely affect
ArrowPoint's ability to attract and retain key management, sales and marketing
and technical personnel.

                             RISKS RELATED TO CISCO

     In addition to the risks discussed above, Cisco is subject to its own
specific risks relating to its business model, strategies, markets and legal and
regulatory environment. For a detailed discussion of these risks, please see the
risk factors included in Cisco's reports filed with the Commission under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which reports are incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/ prospectus.

                          RISKS RELATED TO ARROWPOINT

ARROWPOINT'S LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO VALUE AND
EVALUATE ITS BUSINESS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS


     ArrowPoint commenced operations in April 1997 and commercially released its
first product in the fourth quarter of 1998. Your evaluation of the risks and
uncertainties of ArrowPoint's business will be difficult because of its limited
operating history. In addition, ArrowPoint's limited operating history means
that it has less insight into how technological and market trends may affect its
business. The revenue and income potential of ArrowPoint's business and market
are unproven. You must consider ArrowPoint's business and prospects in light of
the risks and difficulties typically encountered by companies in the early
stages of development, particularly those in new and rapidly evolving markets
such as the Internet infrastructure industry.


                                       16
<PAGE>   23

ARROWPOINT HAS INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES TO DATE AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE MARKET PRICE OF ITS
COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE


     Since ArrowPoint began operations, it has incurred losses in every fiscal
period. It incurred a net loss available to common stockholders of $14.0 million
in the first quarter of 2000 and its accumulated deficit through March 31, 2000
was $39.0 million. ArrowPoint cannot be certain if or when it will become
profitable. Its failure to become profitable within the timeframe expected by
investors may adversely affect the market price of its common stock. ArrowPoint
expects to continue to increase its expenses in an effort to develop its
business and, as a result, will need to generate significant revenue to achieve
profitability. Even if ArrowPoint does achieve profitability, it cannot assure
you that it can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis
in the future.


ARROWPOINT'S OPERATING RESULTS ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST AND MAY FLUCTUATE FROM
QUARTER TO QUARTER, WHICH MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF ITS
COMMON STOCK

     ArrowPoint's operating results are difficult to forecast and may fluctuate
from quarter to quarter. As a result of ArrowPoint's limited operating history,
it does not have historical financial data for a significant number of periods
upon which to forecast quarterly financial performance. If ArrowPoint's
quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors
or securities analysts, the price of its common stock could fall substantially.

     Among the factors that could cause ArrowPoint's quarterly operating results
to fluctuate are:

     - ArrowPoint depends on a relatively small number of customers for a large
       percentage of its revenue in any particular quarter. As a result, a delay
       in a particular quarter in receiving orders from one or a small number of
       customers may have a significant negative impact on its operating results
       for that quarter.

     - ArrowPoint's sales cycle makes it difficult to predict accurately when it
       will complete sales and recognize revenue.

     - ArrowPoint has historically derived a significant portion of its revenue
       from sales that occur near the end of a fiscal quarter. As a result, a
       delay in anticipated sales is more likely to result in a deferral of the
       associated revenue beyond the end of a particular quarter, which would
       have a significant impact on ArrowPoint's operating results for that
       quarter.

     Most of ArrowPoint's operating expenses do not vary directly with revenue
and are difficult to adjust in the short term. As a result, if revenue for a
particular quarter is below ArrowPoint's expectations, it could not
proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter, and therefore this
revenue shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on ArrowPoint's expected
operating results for that quarter.

THERE IS INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS
AND IF ARROWPOINT FAILS TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, ITS REVENUE COULD DECLINE AND
IT COULD EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL LOSSES

     The market for Internet infrastructure solutions is new, rapidly evolving
and very competitive. ArrowPoint expects competition in this market to increase
as a result of factors such as:

     - the entrance of new competitors;

     - innovations that improve competitive products or that enable products or
       services that are not currently competitive with ArrowPoint's solutions
       to compete with ArrowPoint;

                                       17
<PAGE>   24

     - acquisitions of competitive products or technologies, particularly by a
       large competitor with an established market presence and distribution
       capabilities; and

     - strategic alliances, in which competitors succeed in bundling their
       products with other software products, hardware products or services.

     This competition could, among other things:

     - divert sales from ArrowPoint;

     - force ArrowPoint to charge lower prices; and

     - adversely affect ArrowPoint's strategic relationships with manufacturers,
       resellers and others.

     If any of these risks occurred, ArrowPoint's revenues could decline, its
gross margins could decrease, its expenses could increase and it could
experience additional losses.

ARROWPOINT IS GROWING RAPIDLY AND MAY BE UNABLE TO MANAGE ITS GROWTH
EFFECTIVELY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOST SALES OR DISRUPTIONS TO ITS BUSINESS

     ArrowPoint's failure to effectively manage its recent and anticipated
growth could have a material adverse effect on the quality of its products, its
ability to retain key personnel and financial performance. From January 1, 1999
to March 31, 2000, the number of ArrowPoint's employees increased from 60 to
over 330 and it established a sales presence in over 12 U.S. cities and 18
countries. This growth has strained, and may further strain, ArrowPoint's
management, operational systems and other resources. To manage its growth
effectively, ArrowPoint must be able to enhance its financial and accounting
systems and controls, integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations.
There can be no assurance ArrowPoint will be able to do so.

ARROWPOINT PURCHASES SEVERAL OF ITS KEY COMPONENTS FROM SINGLE SOURCES, AND IT
COULD LOSE REVENUE AND MARKET SHARE IF IT WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A SUFFICIENT
SUPPLY OF THOSE COMPONENTS

     Several key components of ArrowPoint's products are currently available
from single vendors. If ArrowPoint is unable to obtain sufficient quantities of
these components, it would be unable to manufacture and ship its products on a
timely basis. This could result in lost or delayed revenue, damage to
ArrowPoint's reputation and increased manufacturing costs.

     Examples of the components which ArrowPoint purchases from single sources
are:

     - critical network processors for the CS-50, CS-150 and the CS-800 from MMC
       Networks;

     - the power supply device for the CS-50 and CS-150 from Cherokee
       International; and

     - the power supply device for the CS-800 from Tectrol.

     ArrowPoint does not have guaranteed supply agreements with any of the
vendors of these products. Moreover, even if supply is available, ArrowPoint's
inability to accurately forecast the demand for its products may result in an
inadequate supply of these components. ArrowPoint's products are designed based
on the MMC network processor, and if it were unable to obtain a sufficient
supply of these network processors from MMC, ArrowPoint would be forced to
significantly modify the design of its products to use different network
processors. If ArrowPoint were unable to obtain a sufficient supply of power
supplies from its current vendors, it would be forced either to develop
alternative sources of supply or to modify the design of its products to use
more readily available components. Redesigning ArrowPoint's products,
particularly a redesign involving new network processors, or identifying new
sources of supply may take a long time and may involve significant additional
expenses. Moreover, its

                                       18
<PAGE>   25

vendors may increase their prices for these components. Accordingly, the lack of
alternative sources for these components may force ArrowPoint to pay higher
prices for these components, which would cause its gross margins to decrease and
could cause it to incur additional losses.

IF ARROWPOINT IS NOT ABLE TO HIRE AND RETAIN THE SKILLED PERSONNEL IT NEEDS TO
SUCCEED, IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GROW ITS BUSINESS AS IT ANTICIPATES

     The growth of ArrowPoint's business and revenue depends in large part upon
its ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled
employees, particularly qualified sales and engineering personnel. ArrowPoint
plans to increase its employee count from 337 at March 31, 2000 to approximately
400 by December 31, 2000. ArrowPoint may not be successful in hiring and
retaining the skilled personnel that it needs. Qualified personnel are in great
demand throughout the computer networking industry.

IF INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS DO NOT ACHIEVE WIDESPREAD COMMERCIAL
ACCEPTANCE, ARROWPOINT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL ITS PRODUCTS AND ITS ABILITY TO
INCREASE REVENUE WOULD BE HARMED


     Widespread commercial acceptance of ArrowPoint's products is critical to
its future success. The market for Internet infrastructure solutions is
relatively new and rapidly evolving. Rather than utilizing Internet
infrastructure solutions, many Web data center administrators manage Internet
traffic by adding servers and interconnecting a variety of single-function
traffic management tools. ArrowPoint's ability to increase revenue in the future
depends on the extent to which its potential customers recognize the value of
its solutions.


     The acceptance of ArrowPoint's products may be hindered by:

     - the failure of prospective customers to recognize the value of Internet
       infrastructure solutions;

     - the reluctance of ArrowPoint's prospective customers to replace or expand
       their current networking solutions, which may be supplied by more
       established vendors, with its products; and

     - the emergence of new technologies or industry standards that could cause
       ArrowPoint's products to be less competitive or obsolete.

     In addition, because the market for Internet infrastructure solutions is in
an early stage of development, ArrowPoint cannot assess the size of the market
accurately, and it has limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect
its business. For example, ArrowPoint may have difficulty in predicting customer
needs, developing products that could address those needs and establishing a
distribution strategy for those products. ArrowPoint may also have difficulties
in predicting the competitive environment that will develop.

IF ARROWPOINT IS UNABLE TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND FEATURES ON A TIMELY BASIS
OR IF ITS NEW PRODUCTS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL, ITS SALES AND COMPETITIVE POSITION WILL
SUFFER


     The market for Internet infrastructure solutions is characterized by
rapidly changing technologies, frequent new product introductions and evolving
customer requirements and industry standards. The rapid growth in the use of the
Web and intense competition in ArrowPoint's industry exacerbate these market
characteristics. In order to remain competitive in its markets, ArrowPoint will
need to introduce on a timely basis new products that offer significantly
improved performance and features, at lower prices, and it may not be successful
in doing so. Some prior versions of ArrowPoint's products were released behind
schedule, and this may happen again in the future. Delays in introducing new
products and features, or the introduction of new products which do not meet the
evolving demands of ArrowPoint's customers, could damage its corporate
reputation and cause a loss of or delay in revenue.


                                       19
<PAGE>   26


In addition, some of the benefits offered by ArrowPoint's products are based on
their ability to route Web requests based on information about, among other
things, the person making the request. To the extent that privacy concerns or
technological developments limit the amount of information available about the
person making the Web request, the benefits of ArrowPoint's products would be
diminished.


BECAUSE ARROWPOINT DERIVES A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS REVENUE FROM A SMALL
NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, ANY LOSS OF OR DELAY IN RECEIVING REVENUE FROM THOSE
CUSTOMERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGE ITS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

     ArrowPoint has historically derived a significant portion of its revenue
from a relatively small number of customers. If any of these customers stop or
delay purchasing products or services from ArrowPoint, its financial performance
would be negatively impacted. NaviSite accounted for 14% of ArrowPoint's revenue
in 1999. None of its reseller or end-user customers are contractually obligated
to purchase future products or services from ArrowPoint, and they may
discontinue doing so at any time. In addition, although ArrowPoint's largest
customers will probably vary from period to period, ArrowPoint anticipates that
a small number of customers will continue to represent a large percentage of its
revenue in any given fiscal period. Accordingly, the failure to obtain a
significant order from a customer within the fiscal period expected by us could
have a significant adverse effect on its financial performance for that fiscal
period.

FACTORS ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE USE OF THE INTERNET COULD REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR
ARROWPOINT'S PRODUCTS


     ArrowPoint's products are designed to enable its customers to provide
faster and more reliable connections to users accessing their Web sites. Any
factors that adversely affect Internet usage could result in less demand for
ArrowPoint's products. Among the factors that could disrupt Internet usage are:


     - security concerns;

     - user dissatisfaction due to network problems or service disruptions that
       prevent users from accessing an Internet server; and

     - delays in, or disputes concerning, the development and adoption of
       industry-wide Internet standards and protocols.

ARROWPOINT IS INVOLVED IN LITIGATION WITH ARROW ELECTRONICS OVER ITS USE OF THE
NAME ARROWPOINT, AND AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN THIS LITIGATION COULD CAUSE
ARROWPOINT TO CHANGE ITS NAME, INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND DAMAGE ITS
COMPETITIVE POSITION

     ArrowPoint was sued by Arrow Electronics in July 1999 over its use of the
trademark ArrowPoint and the Internet domain name arrowpoint.com. Arrow
Electronics is seeking an injunction precluding ArrowPoint from using the name
ArrowPoint and requiring it to relinquish the domain name arrowpoint.com. This
lawsuit is still in the early stages of discovery, and ArrowPoint is not yet
able to assess its potential liability. If ArrowPoint fails to prevail in this
litigation, it may be forced to change its corporate name and its domain name,
which could damage its sales and marketing efforts and competitive position. In
addition, regardless of its outcome, this litigation may force ArrowPoint to
incur significant expenses in defending the lawsuit and may divert the attention
and efforts of its management team from normal business operations.

PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS

     This proxy statement/prospectus is furnished in connection with the
solicitation of proxies from the holders of ArrowPoint common stock by the
ArrowPoint board of directors for use at a special meeting of ArrowPoint
stockholders.


     This proxy statement/prospectus is first being furnished to stockholders of
ArrowPoint on or about Wednesday, May 24, 2000.


DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF THE SPECIAL MEETING


     The special meeting will be held on Friday, June 23, 2000 at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern Time, at the offices of Hale and Dorr, LLP, 60 State Street, 26th Floor,
Boston, Massachusetts.


MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING

     At the special meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the special
meeting, stockholders of ArrowPoint will be asked to consider and vote upon
proposals:

     - to approve the merger agreement; and


     - to grant the proxy authority to transact such business as may properly
       come before the special meeting.


RECORD DATE AND SHARES ENTITLED TO VOTE


     ArrowPoint's board of directors has fixed the close of business on Friday,
May 19, 2000, as the record date for determination of ArrowPoint stockholders
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. As of the close of
business on May 19, 2000, there were approximately              shares of
ArrowPoint common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, held by approximately
       shareholders of record of ArrowPoint. Each ArrowPoint stockholder is
entitled to one vote for each share of ArrowPoint common stock held as of the
record date.


VOTING OF PROXIES

     You are requested to complete, date and sign the accompanying proxy and
promptly return it in the accompanying envelope or otherwise mail it to
ArrowPoint. If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, your broker
will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. Your
broker will provide you directions regarding how to instruct your broker to vote
your shares. All properly executed proxies received by ArrowPoint prior to the
vote at the special meeting, and that are not revoked, will be voted in
accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies. If no direction is
made, your proxy will be voted to approve the merger agreement. ArrowPoint's
board of directors does not presently intend to bring any other business before
the special meeting and, so far as is known to ArrowPoint's board of directors,
no other matters are to be brought before the special meeting. As to any
business that may properly come before the special meeting, however, it is
intended that proxies, in the form enclosed, will be voted in respect thereof in
accordance with the judgment of the persons voting the proxies. You may revoke
your proxy at any time prior to its use by delivering to the Secretary of
ArrowPoint a signed notice of revocation or a subsequently dated, signed proxy,
or by attending the special meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the
special meeting does not in itself constitute the revocation of a proxy.

VOTE REQUIRED

     Delaware General Corporation Law requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of ArrowPoint common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote at the special meeting to approve the merger. Selected
stockholders of ArrowPoint have entered into a stockholder agreement and have
delivered irrevocable proxies obligating them to vote in favor of the merger
agreement and the merger. As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus,
these stockholders, constituting various funds affiliated with Matrix Partners
and North Bridge Venture Partners, as a group beneficially owned 13,269,996
shares (exclusive of any shares issuable upon the exercise of options or
warrants) of ArrowPoint common stock (constituting approximately 38% of the
shares of ArrowPoint common stock outstanding as of the record date). As of the
record date and the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, Cisco owns no
shares of ArrowPoint common stock.

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES

     The required quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting
is a majority of the shares of ArrowPoint common stock issued and outstanding on
the record date. If a quorum is not present in person or represented by proxy,
it is expected that the special meeting will be adjourned or postponed to
solicit additional proxies. Because adoption of the merger agreement and the
consummation of the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares of ArrowPoint common stock entitled to vote, abstentions and
broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against the merger
agreement. In addition, the failure of an ArrowPoint stockholder to return a
proxy will have the effect of a vote against the adoption of the merger
agreement. The actions proposed in this proxy statement/prospectus are not
matters that can be voted on by brokers holding shares for beneficial owners
without the owners' specific instructions. Accordingly, you are urged to return
the enclosed proxy card marked to indicate your vote. Abstentions and broker
non-votes each will be included in determining the number of shares present and
voting at the meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

     In addition to solicitation by mail, the directors, officers and employees
of ArrowPoint may solicit proxies from stockholders by telephone, facsimile or
in person. Following the original mailing of the proxies and other soliciting
materials, ArrowPoint will request brokers, custodians, nominees and other
record holders to forward copies of the proxy and other soliciting materials to
persons for whom they hold shares of ArrowPoint common stock and to request
authority for the exercise of proxies. In these cases, ArrowPoint, upon the
request of the record holders, will reimburse the record holders for their
reasonable expenses.

NO APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     You are not entitled to exercise dissenter's or appraisal rights as a
result of the merger or to demand payment for your shares under Delaware law.

     THE ARROWPOINT BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND
RECOMMENDS THAT ARROWPOINT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" ADOPTION OF THE MERGER
AGREEMENT. IN CONSIDERING SUCH RECOMMENDATION, ARROWPOINT STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD BE

                      THE MERGER AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

     This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes material aspects
of the proposed merger, including the merger agreement and the stock option
agreement. While we believe that the description covers the material terms of
the merger and the related transactions, this summary may not contain all of the
information that is important to you. You should read this entire document and
the other documents we refer to carefully for a more complete understanding of
the merger.

     The following discussion of the background of the merger and the parties'
reasons for the merger and the potential benefits that could result from the
merger contains forward-looking statements which involve risks and
uncertainties. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements. The actual results of Cisco could differ materially
from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of
certain factors, including those set forth under "Risk Factors" on page 14 of
this proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference
in this proxy statement/prospectus.

BACKGROUND OF THE MERGER

     On March 26, 2000, Chin-Cheng Wu and Louis Volpe, the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and President and Chief Operating Officer of ArrowPoint,
respectively, met with Ammar Hanafi, Vijay Parikh and Graeme Fraser of Cisco. At
the meeting, the representatives of ArrowPoint provided an overview of
ArrowPoint and its products. There was no discussion of a merger nor was any
agreement reached to pursue any relationship at this meeting. No subsequent
meetings were scheduled to further explore any relationship.

     On April 10, 2000, Cisco contacted ArrowPoint requesting to hold
discussions relating to a potential strategic relationship between the two
companies.

     On April 12, 2000, ArrowPoint retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. as financial
advisor relating to a potential transaction with Cisco.

     On April 13, 2000, Cisco, represented by Vijay Parikh, Gary Epps, David
Getchell, Janey Hoe, Jack Jenney and Ammar Hanafi met with Chin-Cheng Wu, Louis
Volpe, Peter Piscia, Douglas Potter and Walter Kelt. At the meeting, ArrowPoint
and Cisco executed a non-disclosure agreement. ArrowPoint representatives then
presented to Cisco an overview of ArrowPoint's products, technology and business
strategy. The representatives of Cisco and ArrowPoint then discussed a range of
partnership opportunities including a possible strategic combination of
ArrowPoint with Cisco.

     At the April 18, 2000 meeting of the ArrowPoint board of directors,
ArrowPoint management reported to the ArrowPoint board members on their
discussions with Cisco. At this meeting, ArrowPoint's board authorized
management to continue its discussions with Cisco regarding a strategic
combination.

     On April 20, 2000 Ammar Hanafi and Janey Hoe of Cisco telephoned Chin-Cheng
Wu of ArrowPoint to set up further meetings and to continue discussions.

     Between April 21 and May 4, 2000, representatives and employees of Cisco,
representatives and employees of ArrowPoint and representatives of Goldman,
Sachs held a series of meetings to discuss further ArrowPoint's and Cisco's
products, technologies, markets and business strategies and to discuss further a
strategic combination between the two companies.

     Between April 24, 2000 and May 4, 2000, management of Cisco and ArrowPoint,
together with their respective legal counsel and Goldman, Sachs, held extensive
negotiations regarding the terms and conditions of the agreements relating to a
transaction.

                                       25
<PAGE>   32

     On April 25, 2000, ArrowPoint and Cisco entered into an exclusivity
agreement to permit due diligence and negotiation of a definitive agreement.
Pursuant to this agreement, ArrowPoint agreed not to solicit or negotiate an
alternative acquisition proposal by a party other than Cisco prior to May 5,
2000.

     On May 1, 2000, ArrowPoint's board of directors met by teleconference
during which ArrowPoint's management updated the board as to the status of the
negotiations. The ArrowPoint board authorized and instructed senior management
to continue negotiation of a definitive merger agreement with Cisco.

     On May 1, 2000, Cisco's board of directors held a meeting and unanimously
voted to approve the merger agreement and related transaction documents.

     On May 3, 2000, ArrowPoint's board of directors held a meeting where
ArrowPoint's legal advisors made a presentation on the terms of the proposed
transaction and the board of directors' duties with respect to consideration of
the transaction. Goldman, Sachs, ArrowPoint's financial advisor, made a
presentation on the financial terms of the proposed transaction. ArrowPoint's
legal and financial advisors answered questions posed by the ArrowPoint board of
directors.

     On May 4, 2000, ArrowPoint's board of directors again met with its legal
and financial advisors and discussed the final terms of the proposed merger.
Goldman Sachs reviewed its financial analysis of the proposed transaction,
answered questions posed by the ArrowPoint board of directors and delivered an
oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of such date and based
upon the procedures followed, factors considered and assumptions made by
Goldman, Sachs and subject to the limitations set forth in its opinion, the
exchange ratio in the transaction was fair to ArrowPoint stockholders from a
financial point of view. At the conclusion of these discussions and
presentation, the ArrowPoint board of directors voted to approve the merger
agreement and related transaction documents.

     On the evening of May 4, 2000, ArrowPoint and Cisco entered into the merger
agreement and certain related agreements were executed and delivered by Cisco
and the parties thereto. At approximately 8:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on May 5,
2000, Cisco, in collaboration with ArrowPoint, issued a press release announcing
the proposed business combination.

REASONS FOR THE MERGER

  Cisco's Reasons for the Merger

     Cisco's board of directors has identified several potential benefits of the
merger that it believes will contribute to the success of the combined company.
These potential benefits include the ability to:

     - strengthen Cisco's abilities to offer its customers a broad portfolio of
       content networking solutions;

     - enhance Cisco's capabilities immediately in software and hardware-based
       content switching products that optimize the delivery of Web content; and

     - leverage ArrowPoint's sales and support organizations focused on
       delivering content switching solutions.

     For the strategic reasons set forth above, the Cisco board of directors
determined that the merger agreement and the merger were in the best interests
of Cisco and its stockholders and that Cisco should proceed with the merger
agreement and the merger.

                                       26

  ArrowPoint's Reasons for the Merger

     The ArrowPoint board of directors has approved the merger agreement and
recommends that the holders of shares of ArrowPoint common stock vote FOR the
adoption of the merger agreement.


     The ArrowPoint board of directors' decision to approve the merger agreement
was based primarily on factors resulting from the highly competitive nature of
the market for Internet infrastructure solutions. The ArrowPoint board of
directors believes that increasing competition in the intelligent Web switch
market would make it more difficult for ArrowPoint to succeed as a relatively
small independent company. Despite ArrowPoint's success to date, its board of
directors believes that it would be increasingly important for ArrowPoint to
grow and gain critical mass in order to compete against larger companies with
substantially greater resources and broader, more integrated product offerings.
In order to enhance its competitive position, ArrowPoint's management considered
a number of alternatives, including growth through the acquisition of strategic
technologies that could extend ArrowPoint's product offerings and expansion of
its distribution network, or merger with a larger company.


     The ArrowPoint board of directors identified a number of benefits for
ArrowPoint's stockholders, employees and customers that could result from the
merger. These potential benefits include:

     - operational efficiencies and compatibility of ArrowPoint and Cisco, based
       on their complementary technologies, business philosophies and
       strategies, which the ArrowPoint board of directors believes is important
       for the successful integration of the companies;

     - the ability to dedicate greater resources to both current and emerging
       product development efforts and to fund the future growth of ArrowPoint's
       business;

     - the ability of ArrowPoint to leverage Cisco's extensive distribution
       network and expertise, particularly internationally, and to use Cisco's
       presence in major markets to increase the sales of its products and to
       further expand ArrowPoint's own distribution base;

     - the exchange ratio of ArrowPoint common stock for Cisco common stock
       represented a premium of approximately:

          54% over the closing price as of one week prior to the date of the
          merger agreement; and

          39% over the average closing price during the one month period prior
          to the date of the merger agreement;

     - the opportunity for ArrowPoint stockholders to receive stock with more
       liquidity and less volatility than ArrowPoint common stock;

     - the opportunity for ArrowPoint stockholders to participate in the
       potential for growth of the combined company after the merger;

     - the treatment of the merger as a reorganization for tax purposes;


     - opportunities for ArrowPoint, as part of the combined company, to compete
       more effectively in the intelligent Web switch industry;


     - the exchange ratio of ArrowPoint common stock for Cisco common stock
       under the terms of the merger agreement was fair to the stockholders from
       a financial point of view based upon the opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co.
       dated as of May 4, 2000;

     - greater liquidity to ArrowPoint stockholders offered by Cisco's common
       stock relative to ArrowPoint's common stock;

                                       27
<PAGE>   34

     - current financial market conditions and historical market prices,
       volatility and trading information with respect to ArrowPoint and Cisco
       common stock; and

     - the economic effects on the employees, customers, suppliers and other
       constituents of ArrowPoint and its subsidiaries and on the communities in
       which ArrowPoint and its subsidiaries operate or are located.

     In addition, the ArrowPoint board of directors noted that the merger is
expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests and that no goodwill is
expected to be created on the books of the combined company as a result of the
merger.

     The ArrowPoint board of directors also identified and considered a number
of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger,
including:

     - the possibility that the merger would not be consummated and the effect
       of the public announcement of the merger on ArrowPoint's sales and
       operating results and ArrowPoint's ability to attract and retain key
       management, sales, marketing and technical personnel;

     - the risk that, despite the efforts of ArrowPoint and Cisco, key
       technical, marketing and management personnel might choose not to remain
       employed by Cisco after the merger;

     - the risk that the potential benefits sought in the merger might not be
       realized fully or within the time frame contemplated, if at all;

     - the substantial charges to be incurred, primarily in the quarter in which
       the merger is consummated, including costs of integrating the business
       and transaction expenses arising from the merger; and

     - the other risks associated with Cisco's business and the merger described
       under "Risk Factors" on page 14 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

     The ArrowPoint board of directors believes that the potential benefits of
the merger outweigh these risks.

     The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the
ArrowPoint board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive but is believed
to include all material factors considered by the ArrowPoint board of directors.
In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation
of the merger, the ArrowPoint board of directors did not find it practicable to
and did not quantify or otherwise assign relative weight to the specific factors
considered in reaching its determination. In addition, individual members of the
ArrowPoint board of directors may have given different weight to different
factors.

     In light of the size and diversity of the marketplace and the competitive
positions of both Cisco and ArrowPoint, the ArrowPoint board of directors has
concluded that the merger represents the best current and long-term strategy for
ArrowPoint.

RECOMMENDATION OF ARROWPOINT'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE ARROWPOINT BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS
APPROVED THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND RECOMMENDS THAT ARROWPOINT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE
FOR ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

     In considering the recommendation of the ArrowPoint board of directors with
respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some of the directors
and officers of ArrowPoint have interests in the merger that are different from,
or are in addition to, the interests of ArrowPoint stockholders

                                       28
<PAGE>   35

generally. Please see the section entitled "Interests of ArrowPoint Directors,
Officers and Affiliates in the Merger" on page 51 of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

OPINION OF GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO., FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO ARROWPOINT

     On May 4, 2000, Goldman, Sachs & Co. rendered its written opinion to the
board of directors of ArrowPoint that, as of that date, and based upon and
subject to the various qualifications and assumptions described in its opinion,
the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial
point of view to the holders of ArrowPoint common stock.

     THE FULL TEXT OF THE FAIRNESS OPINION OF GOLDMAN SACHS, DATED MAY 4, 2000,
WHICH SETS FORTH THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE, PROCEDURES FOLLOWED, MATTERS CONSIDERED,
AND LIMITATIONS ON THE REVIEW UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINION, IS
ATTACHED TO THIS PROXY STATEMENT/ PROSPECTUS AS APPENDIX D AND IS INCORPORATED
HEREIN BY REFERENCE. ARROWPOINT STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD READ THE OPINION IN ITS
ENTIRETY.

     In connection with its opinion, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

     - the merger agreement;

     - the registration statement of ArrowPoint on Form S-1, dated March 30,
       2000, relating to the initial public offering of ArrowPoint common stock,
       including the prospectus therein;

     - a draft of the registration statement of ArrowPoint on Form S-4, dated
       May 4, 2000, including a draft of the proxy statement/prospectus relating
       to the special meeting of stockholders of ArrowPoint to be held in
       connection with the merger agreement;

     - annual reports to shareholders and annual reports on Form 10-K of Cisco
       for the five fiscal years ended July 31, 1999;

     - certain interim reports to stockholders and quarterly reports on Form
       10-Q of ArrowPoint and Cisco;

     - certain other communications from ArrowPoint and Cisco to their
       respective stockholders; and

     - certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for ArrowPoint prepared
       by its management.

     In addition, Goldman Sachs:

     - held discussions with members of the senior management of ArrowPoint and
       Cisco regarding the strategic rationale for, and the potential benefits
       of, the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement and the past and
       current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of
       their respective companies;

     - reviewed the reported price and trading activity for ArrowPoint common
       stock and Cisco common stock which, like many Internet related stocks,
       have been and are likely to continue to be subject to significant short
       term volatility;

     - compared certain financial and stock market information for ArrowPoint
       and Cisco with similar information for certain other companies the
       securities of which are publicly traded and reviewed the financial terms
       of certain recent business combinations in the communications technology
       industry specifically and in other industries generally; and

     - performed such other studies and analyses as Goldman Sachs considered
       appropriate.

     Goldman Sachs has relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information discussed with or reviewed by it and has assumed
such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion. As
ArrowPoint was aware, Cisco did not make available to Goldman Sachs Cisco's
forecasts of future financial performance. Accordingly, Goldman Sachs' review of
such

                                       29
<PAGE>   36

matters was limited to discussions with the senior management of Cisco of
certain publicly available estimates of research analysts covering Cisco, which
according to Cisco, do not materially differ from the view of management of
Cisco as to the future performance of Cisco.

     In addition, Goldman Sachs has not made an independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets and liabilities of ArrowPoint or Cisco or any of their
subsidiaries and Goldman Sachs has not been furnished with any such evaluation
or appraisal. In rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs did not address the
underlying business decision of ArrowPoint to effect the transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs' advisory services and its
opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the board of
directors of ArrowPoint in connection with its consideration of the transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement and such opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of ArrowPoint common stock should vote with
respect to such transaction.

     The following is a summary of the material financial analyses considered by
Goldman Sachs in connection with providing its opinion to the board of directors
of ArrowPoint on May 4, 2000. It does not purport to be a complete description
of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs. The order of analyses described, and
the results of those analyses, do not represent the relative importance or
weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Except as otherwise noted, the
following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market
data, is based on market data as it existed on or before May 4, 2000, and is not
necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

     THE SUMMARY INCLUDES INFORMATION PRESENTED IN TABULAR FORMAT. THESE TABLES
SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE TEXT OF EACH SUMMARY.

TRADING PRICE HISTORY

     Goldman Sachs reviewed the closing price of ArrowPoint common stock since
it began trading on March 31, 2000 following its initial public offering and of
Cisco common stock during the one year period ended May 4, 2000. In the period
from March 31, 2000 through May 4, 2000, the closing price of ArrowPoint common
stock ranged between $59.50 and $140.75 and the average closing price of
ArrowPoint common stock during this period was $103.93. The average price of
ArrowPoint common stock based on one-minute trading intervals during the period
from March 31, 2000 through May 4, 2000 was $100.54. The average closing price
of Cisco common stock was $67.69, $66.88, $67.54, $67.91 and $45.26 for the five
day, ten day, one month, three month and one year periods ended May 4, 2000,
respectively. On May 4, 2000, the closing price of Cisco common stock was
$63.63.

TRANSACTION PREMIUM ANALYSIS

     Noting the very significant increase in the price of ArrowPoint common
stock during the two days preceding the announcement of the merger on May 5,
2000, and a substantial decline in the price of Cisco common stock during the
same period, Goldman Sachs conducted premium analyses based on both the May 2
and May 4, 2000 closing prices. At the exchange ratio of 2.1218 shares of Cisco
common stock for each share of ArrowPoint common stock, Goldman Sachs noted
that, based on the closing prices of Cisco common stock of $68.00 and ArrowPoint
common stock of $103.00 on May 2, 2000, the implied price per share being paid
in the merger was $144.28, which represented a premium of 40.1%, and based on
the closing prices of Cisco common stock of $63.63 and ArrowPoint common stock
of $134.81 on May 4, 2000, the implied price per share being paid in the merger
was $135.00, representing a premium of 0.1%. Goldman Sachs then calculated what
the implied premium would be using the exchange ratio of 2.1218 shares of Cisco
common stock for each share of ArrowPoint common stock, the closing prices of
Cisco common stock on May 2, 2000 of $68.00 and on May 4, 2000 of $63.63 and
various additional prices of ArrowPoint common stock. The following additional

                                       30
<PAGE>   37

prices of ArrowPoint common stock were used: the all-time high trading price,
the all-time low trading price, the highest closing price, the lowest closing
price, the average closing price for the ten trading day periods ending through
May 2 and May 4, 2000 and the average closing prices since ArrowPoint's IPO
through May 2 and through May 4, 2000. The results of this analysis are as
follows:

REVENUES AND EARNINGS MULTIPLES ANALYSIS

     Using the implied price per share based on the exchange ratio of 2.1218
shares of Cisco common stock for each share of ArrowPoint common stock and the
closing price of Cisco common stock of $63.63 on May 4, 2000, Goldman Sachs
calculated the levered market capitalization of ArrowPoint as a multiple of
ArrowPoint's estimated revenues, estimated earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization, or EBITA, and estimated earnings per share before amortization of
deferred compensation, or cash EPS, for fiscal years 2000 and 2001. The analysis
assumes that there were 41.7 million shares of ArrowPoint common stock
outstanding on a fully diluted basis, taking into account 7.1 million
outstanding options based on the treasury method. ArrowPoint's levered market
capitalization was calculated using the implied price per share based on the
exchange ratio adjusted for the amount of ArrowPoint's net debt (cash) after
giving pro forma effect to ArrowPoint's IPO. Estimates of ArrowPoint's revenues,
EBITA and cash EPS were based on projections of ArrowPoint management and
ArrowPoint's SEC filings, which in the case of ArrowPoint's cash EPS, excluded
stock compensation charges and assumed that no additional options were granted.
Street estimates of ArrowPoint's revenues were based on the average of publicly
available estimates of four research analysts who initiated coverage of
ArrowPoint following its IPO. Street estimates of ArrowPoint's EBITA were based
on the average of publicly available estimates of three of these analysts who
specify stock-based compensation charges. Street estimates of

ArrowPoint's cash EPS were based on the mean of publicly available estimates of
three of these analysts who specify cash or pro forma EPS. The results of these

COMPARISON OF SELECTED COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

     Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared financial information of ArrowPoint,
Cisco and three groups of other companies whose securities are publicly traded.
These three groups were as follows:

     Layer 3+ switching/load balancing vendors:

     - Alteon Websystems;

     - Extreme Networks;

     - F5 Networks;

     - Foundry Networks;

     - Packeteer; and

     - Radware

     Other Internet infrastructure leaders:

     - Brocade Communications;

     - Clarent;

     - Cobalt Networks;

     - Inktomi;

     - Juniper Networks;

     - Redback Networks; and

     - Sycamore Networks

     Systems companies:

     - Lucent Technologies;

     - Nortel Networks; and

     - Cisco

     Goldman Sachs calculated the implied value of ArrowPoint common stock based
on the exchange ratio, the closing price of Cisco common stock on May 4, 2000
and the range of closing prices and the median closing prices on May 4, 2000 of
the common stock of the companies comprising each of the three groups of other
companies examined, in each case as a percentage of the respective 52 week
closing high. Goldman Sachs also calculated various financial multiples and
ratios for ArrowPoint, Cisco

                                       32
<PAGE>   39

and the three groups of other companies examined using (i) the closing prices of
the common stock of these companies on May 4, 2000, (ii) the equity market
capitalization of these companies on a fully diluted basis, (iii) the levered
value of these companies and (iv) estimates of revenues and earnings for these
companies. Levered value means equity market capitalization on a fully diluted
basis plus net debt (cash). In the case of ArrowPoint, the financial multiples
and ratios were also calculated using the implied value of ArrowPoint common
stock based on the exchange ratio and the closing price of Cisco common stock on
May 4, 2000 of $63.63. In addition, in the case of ArrowPoint, estimates of
revenues and earnings were based on projections of ArrowPoint management, which
excluded stock compensation charges and assumed no additional options were
granted. ArrowPoint street estimates of revenues were based on the mean of
publicly available estimates of four research analysts who initiated coverage of
ArrowPoint following its IPO and street estimates of EPS were based on the mean
of publicly available cash EPS estimates of three of these analysts who
specified cash or pro forma EPS. In the case of Cisco, estimated revenues were
from IBES calendarized estimates and estimated earnings were from publicly
available estimates of research analysts covering Cisco. In the case of the
companies (excluding Cisco) comprising the three groups of other companies
examined, estimates of revenues and earnings were obtained from the following
sources:

     - for estimated revenues, publicly available estimates of research analysts
       covering these companies; and

     - for estimated earnings, IBES estimates.

     The analysis assumes that there were 41.7 million shares of ArrowPoint
common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis, taking into account 7.1
million outstanding options based on the treasury method. The following table
presents the results of the analyses:

COMPARABLE TRANSACTION MULTIPLES AND PREMIUMS ANALYSIS

     Goldman Sachs reviewed a number of communications technology industry
transactions between April 1996 and March 2000 and compared them to the merger.
Using the implied price per share based

                                       33
<PAGE>   40

on the exchange ratio of 2.1218 shares of Cisco common stock for each share of
ArrowPoint common stock and closing prices for Cisco common stock and ArrowPoint
common stock on May 4, 2000, of $63.63 and $134.81, respectively, Goldman Sachs
calculated (i) the levered value of ArrowPoint, (ii) the levered value of
ArrowPoint as a multiple of ArrowPoint's last 12 months, or LTM, sales, (iii)
the equity market capitalization of ArrowPoint as a multiple of ArrowPoint's LTM
net income and next twelve months, or forward, net income, (iv) the multiple of
Cisco's levered market capitalization to its LTM revenues to the multiple paid
in the merger and (v) the implied premium per share being paid by Cisco in the
merger based on the ArrowPoint closing price on April 27, 2000, the fifth
trading day prior to May 4, 2000. Levered value means equity market
capitalization on a fully diluted basis plus net debt (cash). Estimates of
ArrowPoint's net income were based on projections of ArrowPoint management.
Goldman Sachs then compared these amounts and ratios with publicly available
information for the other communications technology industry transactions that
it reviewed. The results of the analyses are as follows:

PRO FORMA TRANSACTION ANALYSIS

     Goldman Sachs analyzed the pro forma financial impact for Cisco's fiscal
year ending July 31, 2001 of the merger on net income, earnings per share, or
EPS, on a fully diluted basis, cash EPS on a fully diluted basis, revenues and
revenues per share. Goldman Sachs compared the estimated net income, EPS, cash
earnings, cash EPS, revenues and revenues per share for 2001 for each of Cisco
and ArrowPoint, on a stand-alone basis, to the estimated net income, EPS, cash
earnings, cash EPS, revenues and revenues per share of the combined company on a
pro forma basis and the accretion/(dilution) to Cisco of the merger for EPS,
cash EPS and revenues per share. Goldman Sachs performed this analysis based on
the exchange ratio of 2.1218 shares of Cisco common stock for each share of
ArrowPoint common stock on a fully diluted basis using a closing price on May 4,
2000 of $63.63 for Cisco common stock and $134.81 for ArrowPoint common stock.

     The analyses were prepared using the following estimates:

     - estimates of earnings, EPS, cash earnings, cash EPS, revenues and
       revenues per share for ArrowPoint were based on projections of ArrowPoint
       management adjusted to Cisco's fiscal year end;

                                       34
<PAGE>   41

     - estimates of weighted average number of shares outstanding for ArrowPoint
       were based on estimates contained in publicly available Goldman Sachs
       equity research reports regarding ArrowPoint; and

     - estimates of earnings, EPS, cash earnings, cash EPS, revenues, revenues
       per share and weighted average number of shares outstanding for Cisco
       were based on estimates contained in publicly available Goldman Sachs
       equity research reports regarding Cisco.

     The analysis was based on the following assumptions:

     - all outstanding ArrowPoint options would be rolled over tax free and no
       additional options would be issued;

     - the combined company would be subject to a tax rate of 30.0%;

     - a pretax margin for Cisco of 30.8% in fiscal year 2001; and

     - the merger would be treated as a pooling-of-interests for accounting
       purposes.

EXCHANGE RATIO ANALYSIS

     Goldman Sachs calculated the exchange ratio between ArrowPoint common stock
and Cisco common stock on a daily basis from ArrowPoint's IPO on March 31, 2000
through May 4, 2000 based on closing prices of these stocks. The median exchange
ratio during this period was 1.4861.


     The exchange ratio of 2.1218 shares of Cisco common stock for each share of
ArrowPoint common stock being offered in the merger represents a 0.1% premium to
the exchange ratio of 2.1189 based on the closing prices of those stocks on May
4, 2000 and an 8.3% premium to the all-time high exchange ratio prior to May 4,
2000 of 1.9600 on April 6, 2000. The all-time low exchange ratio, on April 14,
2000, was 1.0439.


CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

     Goldman Sachs calculated the respective percentage contribution of Cisco
and ArrowPoint to the estimated market capitalization, estimated net income and
estimated revenues of the combined company for fiscal years 2000 and 2001.
Estimates for ArrowPoint were based on projections of ArrowPoint management,
adjusted to Cisco's fiscal year by averaging quarterly projections. Estimates
for Cisco were based on estimates contained in publicly available Goldman Sachs
equity research reports regarding Cisco. Equity market capitalization assumes
that there were 41.7 million shares of ArrowPoint common stock outstanding on a
fully diluted basis, taking into account 7.1 million outstanding options based
on the treasury method.

LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS


     Goldman Sachs performed a common stock liquidity analysis of ArrowPoint and
Cisco based on information contained in the SEC filings of ArrowPoint and Cisco
and from Bloomberg, L.P. The number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted
basis was calculated using information provided by ArrowPoint management to
determine the number of outstanding ArrowPoint options as of May 2, 2000 and
information contained in Cisco's SEC filings to determine the number of
outstanding Cisco options. Both the outstanding ArrowPoint options and the
outstanding Cisco options were accounted for using the treasury method. The
analysis assumes that no more than 10% of Cisco's average daily volume is traded
by holders of ArrowPoint common stock per day. The following table presents for
ArrowPoint and Cisco the number of shares outstanding, the number of shares
outstanding on a fully diluted basis, the number of shares held by
non-affiliates, or the "public float," the number of shares in the public float
as a percentage of shares outstanding, the average daily volume of shares
traded, the average closing price per share traded, and the average dollar
volume of shares traded:

     The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not
necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering
the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying the opinion of Goldman Sachs. In arriving at its opinion, Goldman
Sachs considered the results of all such analyses and did not attribute any
particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it; rather, Goldman
Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and
professional judgment after considering the results of all such analyses. No
company used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to
ArrowPoint or Cisco.

     Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses solely for purposes of providing an
opinion to the board as to the fairness of the exchange ratio to the holders of
shares of ArrowPoint common stock from a financial point of view, and they do
not purport to be appraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at
which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon
forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by
these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty

                                       36
<PAGE>   43

and are based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties
or their respective advisors, none of ArrowPoint, Cisco or Goldman Sachs assumes
responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted.
As described above, the opinion of Goldman Sachs to the ArrowPoint board was one
of many factors taken into consideration by the ArrowPoint board in making its
determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not
purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs.

     Goldman Sachs, as part of its investment banking business, is continually
engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive biddings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements
and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. Goldman Sachs is
familiar with ArrowPoint, having acted as its financial advisor in connection
with, and having participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the
merger agreement. Goldman Sachs has also provided certain investment banking
services to Cisco from time to time, including having acted as financial advisor
in various strategic advisory assignments including, but not limited to, the
acquisition of the optical systems business of Pirelli SpA in December 1999.
Goldman Sachs may provide investment banking services to Cisco in the future. In
addition, Goldman Sachs is a full service securities firm and in the ordinary
course of its trading activities it may from time to time effect transactions,
for its own account or the account of customers, and hold positions in
securities or options on securities of ArrowPoint and Cisco.

     Pursuant to a letter agreement dated April 12, 2000 between ArrowPoint and
Goldman Sachs, ArrowPoint engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its exclusive
financial advisor in connection with the possible sale of all or a majority of
ArrowPoint. Pursuant to the terms of this letter, if the merger is consummated,
ArrowPoint will pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee equal to 0.41% of the
aggregate consideration paid by Cisco for the ArrowPoint common stock (including
amounts paid to holders of options, warrants and convertible securities)
pursuant to the merger agreement, plus the principal amount of all indebtedness
for borrowed money as set forth on the most recent consolidated balance sheet of
ArrowPoint prior to the consummation of the merger.

     In addition, ArrowPoint has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs periodically,
upon request, and upon consummation of the merger or upon termination of its
services pursuant to the letter agreement, for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including the fees and disbursements of Goldman Sachs' attorneys, plus
any sales, use or similar taxes (including additions to such taxes, if any)
arising in connection with any matter referred to in the letter. ArrowPoint has
also agreed to indemnify Goldman Sachs and certain related persons against
certain liabilities in connection with its engagement, including liabilities
under the federal securities laws.

COMPLETION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MERGER

     The merger will be completed when all of the conditions to completion of
the merger are satisfied or waived, including adoption of the merger agreement
by the ArrowPoint stockholders. The merger will become effective upon the filing
of a certificate of merger with the State of Delaware.


     We are working towards completing the merger as quickly as possible. We
hope to complete the merger by the end of June 2000. Because the merger is
subject to government approvals, we cannot predict the exact timing.


STRUCTURE OF THE MERGER AND CONVERSION OF ARROWPOINT COMMON STOCK

     In accordance with the merger agreement and Delaware law, Archer
Acquisition Corporation, a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Cisco, will
be merged with and into ArrowPoint. As a result

                                       37
<PAGE>   44

of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Archer Acquisition
Corporation will cease and ArrowPoint will survive the merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cisco.

     Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of ArrowPoint common
stock, other than shares held by Cisco and its subsidiaries, will be canceled
and converted into the right to receive 2.1218 shares of Cisco common stock. A
corresponding right to purchase shares of Cisco Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, no par value, pursuant to the Cisco Rights Agreement dated as
of June 10, 1998 between Cisco and BankBoston, N.A. will accompany each share of
Cisco common stock. The number of shares of Cisco common stock issuable in the
merger will be proportionately adjusted for any additional future stock split,
stock dividend or similar event with respect to ArrowPoint common stock or Cisco
common stock effected between the date of the merger agreement and the
completion of the merger.

     No fractional shares of Cisco common stock will be issued in connection
with the merger. In lieu of a fraction of a share of Cisco common stock, you
will receive an amount of cash equal to the product of the fraction multiplied
by the average closing price for a share of Cisco common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market for the last ten trading days ending on the last full trading
day prior to the merger.

EXCHANGE OF ARROWPOINT STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR CISCO STOCK CERTIFICATES

     When the merger is completed, the exchange agent will mail to you a letter
of transmittal and instructions for use in surrendering your ArrowPoint stock
certificates in exchange for Cisco stock certificates. When you deliver your
ArrowPoint stock certificates to the exchange agent along with a properly
executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents, your ArrowPoint
stock certificates will be canceled and you will receive Cisco stock
certificates representing the number of full shares of Cisco common stock to
which you are entitled under the merger agreement (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares).

               YOU SHOULD NOT SUBMIT YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES FOR
         EXCHANGE UNTIL YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL AND
                        INSTRUCTIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE.

     You are not entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions on
Cisco common stock with a record date after the merger is completed until you
have surrendered your ArrowPoint stock certificates in exchange for Cisco stock
certificates.

     If there is any dividend or other distribution on Cisco common stock with a
record date after the merger and a payment date prior to the date you surrender
your ArrowPoint stock certificates in exchange for Cisco stock certificates, you
will receive it with respect to the whole shares of Cisco common stock issued to
you promptly after your ArrowPoint stock certificates are surrendered. If there
is any dividend or other distribution on Cisco common stock with a record date
after the merger and a payment date after the date you surrender your ArrowPoint
stock certificates in exchange for Cisco stock certificates, you will receive it
with respect to the whole shares of Cisco common stock issued to you promptly
after the payment date.

     Cisco will only issue a Cisco stock certificate or a check in lieu of a
fractional share in a name other than the name in which a surrendered ArrowPoint
stock certificate is registered if you present the exchange agent with all
documents required to show and effect the unrecorded transfer of ownership and
show that you paid any applicable stock transfer taxes.

TREATMENT OF ARROWPOINT STOCK OPTION AND STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

     At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of ArrowPoint common stock issued under ArrowPoint's 1997 Stock Incentive
Plan and 2000 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan will be assumed by Cisco
regardless of whether the options are vested or unvested. Each ArrowPoint stock
option, which will be assumed by Cisco, will continue to have the same terms,
and be subject to the same conditions, that were applicable to the option
immediately prior to the effective time, except that:

     - 50% of the unvested portion of each option shall become vested
       immediately prior to the closing of the merger;

     - each ArrowPoint stock option will be exercisable for shares of Cisco
       common stock;

     - the number of shares of Cisco common stock issuable upon exercise of any
       given ArrowPoint option will be determined by multiplying 2.1218 by the
       number of shares of ArrowPoint common stock underlying the option,
       rounded down to the nearest whole number; and

     - the per share exercise price of any given option will be determined by
       dividing the exercise price of the option immediately prior to the
       effective time by 2.1218, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.


     Cisco has agreed to file a registration statement on Form S-8 covering
shares of Cisco common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding
ArrowPoint options granted to individuals for which a registration statement on
Form S-8 is available. Cisco also has agreed to file a registration statement on
Form S-3 covering shares of Cisco common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding
options granted to entities or individuals (including entities controlled by
ArrowPoint directors which are not eligible for registration on Form S-8) and to
keep this registration statement on Form S-3 available for one year.


TREATMENT OF ARROWPOINT RESTRICTED STOCK

     At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of ArrowPoint
restricted stock granted under ArrowPoint's 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and
subject to a stock restriction agreement will be assumed by Cisco. Each
ArrowPoint share, subject to a stock restriction agreement will continue to have
the same terms and conditions that were applicable to such shares immediately
prior to the effective time except that:


     - 50% of the unvested shares shall become vested immediately prior to the
       closing of the merger;



     - each ArrowPoint share will be exchanged for 2.1218 shares of Cisco common
       stock; and



     - each ArrowPoint share will be subject to repurchase by Cisco.


TREATMENT OF STOCK PURCHASED UNDER THE 2000 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN


     At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase shares under
ArrowPoint's 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be assumed by Cisco. The
first offering period under the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which began
on May 1, 2000 and ends October 31, 2000, will be subject to the same terms and
conditions except that when each outstanding purchase right under ArrowPoint's
2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is exercised on October 31, 2000, each
participant shall be issued 2.1218 shares of Cisco common stock for each share
of ArrowPoint common stock which the participant would have been entitled to
purchase.

     Until the merger is completed or the merger agreement is terminated,
ArrowPoint has agreed not to directly or indirectly take any of the following
actions:

     - solicit, initiate, encourage or agree to any takeover proposal; or

     - engage in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose any nonpublic
       information relating to ArrowPoint or any of its subsidiaries to, or

       be considering making, or that has made, a takeover proposal.

     The ArrowPoint board of directors is not prohibited from taking and
disclosing to ArrowPoint's stockholders a position with respect to a tender
offer pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Additionally, the ArrowPoint board of directors is not prohibited from providing
a copy of the non-solicitation provision of the merger agreement to any third
party.


     ArrowPoint has agreed to provide Cisco with detailed information about any
takeover proposal it receives. However, ArrowPoint may engage in any of these
otherwise prohibited acts, other than solicitation, initiation or encouragement
of any takeover proposal, if, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by
the ArrowPoint stockholders the ArrowPoint board of directors:



     - believes in good faith that a particular proposal concerning an
       extraordinary transaction of the nature specified in the merger
       agreement, such as a merger or a sale of significant assets, will result
       in a transaction more favorable than the merger to the ArrowPoint
       stockholders from a financial point of view; and



     - determines in good faith after advice from outside legal counsel that
       engaging in the prohibited negotiations or discussions or providing
       non-public information is necessary in order to comply with the fiduciary
       duties of the board of directors under applicable law.


     A takeover proposal is (other than the merger):

     - any offer or proposal for or indication of interest in a merger or other
       business combination involving ArrowPoint or any of its subsidiaries;

     - the acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock
       of ArrowPoint or any of its subsidiaries; or

     - the acquisition of a significant portion of the assets of ArrowPoint or
       any of its subsidiaries.

        occurred on or before October 31, 2000 (the final date may be extended
        to December 31, 2000 only if the closing is delayed due to the failure
        of the registration statement relating to the issuance of Cisco shares
        in the merger to be declared effective or the failure to obtain required
        governmental approvals in time to permit this closing to occur by
        October 31, 2000, the original termination date);

      - any permanent injunction or other order of a court or other competent

        and the breach shall not have been cured within 10 business days of
        receipt by ArrowPoint of written notice of the breach;

      - the ArrowPoint board of directors shall have withdrawn or modified its
        recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger in a manner adverse

        any person that has advised ArrowPoint that it may be considering
        making, or that has made, a takeover proposal except as permitted in the
        merger agreement;

      - the ArrowPoint board of directors shall have recommended, endorsed,
        accepted or agreed to a takeover proposal or has resolved to do so;

      - for any reason ArrowPoint fails to call and hold the special meeting by
        September 30, 2000 or December 15, 2000 if this proxy
        statement/prospectus shall not be declared effective by September 30,
        2000 under circumstances in which it can be reasonably expected that the

        shall not be declared effective or the applicable waiting period under
        the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act shall not be terminated or expired; or

      - if a trigger event (as defined in the merger agreement) or takeover
        proposal (as defined in the merger agreement) shall have occurred and
        the board of directors of ArrowPoint in connection therewith, does not
        within 10 business days of such occurrence:

        - reconfirm its approval and recommendation of the merger agreement and
          the transactions contemplated thereby; and


        - reject such takeover proposal or trigger event;

connection with the proxy statement/prospectus and the listing of additional

       ArrowPoint that it may be considering making, or that it has made, a
       takeover proposal in violation of the non-solicitation provisions
       contained in the merger agreement;

                                       46
<PAGE>   53

     - the ArrowPoint board of directors shall have recommended, endorsed,

       and at the time of the action there shall not exist circumstances giving
       rise to a material adverse effect on Cisco;

     - the ArrowPoint board of directors shall have withdrawn or modified its
       recommendation of the merger agreement or the merger in a manner adverse
       to Cisco or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing and prior to

       vote held at a duly held meeting of stockholders and prior to the meeting
       there was a takeover proposal which was not rejected by ArrowPoint and

       material adverse effect on Cisco;

     - ArrowPoint has breached its representations, warranties or obligations
       under the reorganization agreement, ArrowPoint has failed to timely call
       and hold its stockholders' meeting or the merger shall not have been
       timely consummated and prior to such event a trigger event or takeover
       proposal that has not been rejected by ArrowPoint or withdrawn shall have
       occurred;


then ArrowPoint will pay Cisco the termination fee of $150 million. In addition,
ArrowPoint has agreed that under certain circumstances it shall pay Cisco's
out-of-pocket costs and expenses upon termination of the merger agreement and in
the event any takeover proposal or trigger event is consummated within six or
twelve months (depending on the persons making such takeover proposal or trigger
event) of the later of the termination of the merger agreement or payment of
Cisco's fees and expenses, ArrowPoint will pay the additional sum of $150
million less any expenses previously paid by ArrowPoint to Cisco.


  Extension, Waiver and Amendment of the Merger Agreement

     The board of directors of either party may amend the merger agreement at
any time before completion of the merger. However, after the ArrowPoint or
Archer Acquisition Corporation stockholders adopt the merger agreement, no
change will be made:

     - to the number of shares of ArrowPoint common stock for which ArrowPoint
       common stock will be converted;

     - to any term of the certificate of incorporation of ArrowPoint to be
       effected by the merger; or

     - to any of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement if the change
       would harm the holders of ArrowPoint common stock or Archer Acquisition
       Corporation common stock.

     Either party may extend the other's time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts under the merger agreement, waive any inaccuracies in
the other's representations and warranties and waive compliance by the other
with any of the agreements or conditions contained in the merger agreement.

RELATED AGREEMENTS

  Stockholder Agreements

     In connection with the merger, various funds associated with Matrix
Partners and North Bridge Venture Partners have entered into stockholder
agreements with Cisco. The terms of the stockholder

                                       47
<PAGE>   54

agreement provide that the stockholders will vote all shares of ArrowPoint
common stock beneficially owned by them in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement.

     The stockholder agreements also required the stockholders to deliver an
irrevocable proxy to Cisco. The irrevocable proxy enables Cisco to vote the
stockholders' shares to approve the merger. As of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus, the ArrowPoint stockholders who entered into the
stockholder agreements collectively held 13,269,996 shares of ArrowPoint common
stock which represented approximately 38% of the outstanding ArrowPoint common
stock. None of the stockholders who are parties to the stockholder agreement was
paid additional consideration in connection with the stockholder agreements.

  Employment and Non-Competition Agreements


     Several employees and executive officers, as a condition to closing of the
merger, are required to enter into employment and non-competition agreements
with Cisco that will become effective upon completion of the merger. The
agreements require the employees to remain with Cisco for a period of two years
from the closing of the merger unless Cisco terminates them earlier. If the
employee's employment is terminated without cause prior to the two year period,
Cisco will continue to pay the employee's base salary as a severance payment for
the earlier of one year from the date of termination or the date the employee
begins employment with another employer. If the employment is terminated for
cause prior to the two year period, the employee will be paid all salary and
benefits through the date of termination of employment, but nothing else.



     For purposes of these severance benefits, "without cause" shall mean the
individual's termination for any reason other than failure to perform the duties
of his or her position after receipt of a written warning describing the failure
and 30 days in which to cure, gross misconduct, conviction of a crime other than
a traffic offense, any act of fraud against, or the serious misappropriation of
property belonging to Cisco, or material breach of the employment agreement or
any confidentiality or proprietary information agreement with Cisco.


     The employment and non-competition agreements require that the employee
will not participate or engage in the design, development, manufacture,
production, marketing, sale or servicing of any product, or the provision of any
service, that directly relates to the business of Cisco or permit the employee's
name to be used in connection with a business which is competitive or
substantially similar to the business of Cisco, in each case for a certain
period after the merger.

     Cisco has also agreed that, after the merger, Cisco will indemnify each
officer and director of ArrowPoint serving as such on the date of the merger
agreement as provided in the Delaware General Corporation Law, the ArrowPoint
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the ArrowPoint amended and
restated bylaws. Please also see the section entitled "Indemnification and
Insurance" on page 50 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

  Stock Option Agreement

     Cisco required ArrowPoint to enter into a stock option agreement as a
prerequisite to entering into the merger agreement. The stock option agreement
grants Cisco the option to buy up to 6,974,047 shares of ArrowPoint common
stock, constituting approximately 19.9% of the outstanding shares of ArrowPoint
common stock as of May 4, 2000, at an exercise price, payable in cash, of $135
per share.

     The option is intended to increase the likelihood that the merger will be
completed. Consequently, aspects of the stock option agreement may have the
effect of discouraging persons who might now or at

                                       48
<PAGE>   55

any time be interested in acquiring all or a significant interest in ArrowPoint
or its assets before completion of the merger.

     The stock option agreement is exercisable by Cisco, in whole or in part, at
any time or from time to time after the occurrence of an event which would
require payment to Cisco of the $150 million termination fee. The Cisco option
will terminate upon the earlier of:

     - the effective time of the merger;

     - the termination of the merger agreement pursuant to its terms, other than
       a termination in connection with which Cisco is entitled to the payment
       of the termination fee or expense reimbursement;

     - 180 or, in some circumstances, 270 days, following any termination of the
       merger agreement in connection with which Cisco is entitled to the
       payment of the $150 million termination fee; or

     - if at the expiration of such period, the Cisco option cannot be exercised
       by reason of any applicable judgment, decree, order, law or regulation,
       ten business days after such impediment to exercise shall have been
       removed or shall have become final and not subject to appeal. The Cisco
       option may not, however, be exercised if Cisco is in material breach of
       any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
       in the stock option agreement or in the merger agreement.

     Under the terms of the stock option agreement, at any time during which the
Cisco option is exercisable, or the repurchase period, Cisco has the right to
require ArrowPoint, or any successor entity thereof, to repurchase from Cisco
all or any part of the Cisco option, to the extent not previously exercised (the
Cisco Put) and ArrowPoint has the right to require Cisco, or any successor
entity thereof, to sell to ArrowPoint all or any part of the Cisco option, to
the extent not previously exercised (the ArrowPoint Call), at the price set
forth in subparagraph (a) below. Furthermore at any time during which the Cisco
option is exercisable, Cisco has the right to require ArrowPoint, or any
successor entity thereof, to repurchase from Cisco (the Cisco Put) and
ArrowPoint has the right to require Cisco, or any successor entity thereof, to
sell to ArrowPoint, (the ArrowPoint Call), all or any part of the ArrowPoint
shares purchased by Cisco pursuant to the Cisco option at the price set forth in
subparagraph (b) below:

          (a) The difference between (i) the "market/tender offer price" for
     shares of ArrowPoint common stock as of the date either party gives notice
     of its intent to exercise its rights, which is defined as the higher of:

     - the price per share offered as of the notice date pursuant to any tender
       or exchange offer or other takeover proposal, as defined in the merger
       agreement, which was made prior to the notice date and not terminated or
       withdrawn as of the notice date of the exercise of the Cisco Put or the
       ArrowPoint Call, as the case may be; or

     - the average of the closing prices of shares of ArrowPoint common stock on
       the Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading days immediately preceding
       the notice date of the exercise of the Cisco Put or the ArrowPoint Call,
       as the case may be,


    and (ii) $135, multiplied by the number of ArrowPoint shares purchasable
    pursuant to the stock option agreement, or portion thereof with respect to
    which either party can exercise this right under the stock option agreement,
    but only if the market/tender offer price exceeds $135.


          (b) The exercise price paid by Cisco for the ArrowPoint shares
     acquired pursuant to the stock option agreement plus the difference between
     the market/tender offer price and $135, but only if

                                       49
<PAGE>   56

     the market/tender offer price exceeds $135, multiplied by the number of
     ArrowPoint shares purchased by Cisco pursuant to the stock option
     agreement.

     Notwithstanding (a) and (b) above, in no event shall the proceeds payable
to Cisco as a result of the Cisco Put or the ArrowPoint Call exceed the sum of
(x) $150 million, plus (y) $135 multiplied by the number of ArrowPoint shares
purchased by Cisco pursuant to the stock option agreement minus (z) any amount
paid to Cisco by ArrowPoint as a termination fee pursuant to the merger
agreement.

     Subsequent to the termination of the merger agreement, Cisco may, by
written notice, request that ArrowPoint register under the Securities Act all or
any part of the shares of ArrowPoint common stock acquired pursuant to the stock
option agreement. ArrowPoint shall use its reasonable best efforts to register
the unpurchased registrable shares; provided, however, Cisco shall not be
entitled to more than an aggregate of two effective registration statements and
ArrowPoint will not be required to file any registration statement for a certain
period of time when:

     - ArrowPoint is in possession of material non-public information which it
       reasonably believes would be detrimental to be disclosed at that time
       and, after consultation with legal counsel to ArrowPoint, ArrowPoint
       determined that the information would have to be disclosed if a
       registration statement were filed at that time;

     - ArrowPoint is required under the Securities Act to include audited
       financial statements for any period in the registration statement and
       such financial statements are not then available for inclusion in the
       registration statement; or

     - ArrowPoint determines, in its reasonable judgment, that the registration
       would interfere with any financing, acquisition or other material
       transaction involving ArrowPoint or any of its affiliates.

OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THE MERGER

     Following the merger, ArrowPoint will continue its operations as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Cisco. Upon consummation of the merger, the members
of ArrowPoint's board of directors will be Michelangelo Volpi, Daniel Scheinman
and Larry Carter. The membership of the Cisco board of directors will remain
unchanged as a result of the merger. The stockholders of ArrowPoint will become
stockholders of Cisco, and their rights as stockholders will be governed by
Cisco's articles of incorporation and bylaws and the laws of the State of
California.

INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE

     The merger agreement provides that Cisco will, after the completion of the
merger, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of ArrowPoint in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to
the completion of the merger, in each case to the fullest extent the corporation
is permitted under Delaware law, the ArrowPoint amended restated certificate of
incorporation or the ArrowPoint amended and restated bylaws, in each case as in
effect on May 4, 2000.

     The merger agreement also provides that, for five years after the
completion of the merger, Cisco will either:

     - at all times maintain at least $50 million in cash, marketable securities
       and unrestricted lines of credit to be available to indemnify the present
       and former officers, directors, employees and agents of ArrowPoint
       against specified liabilities; or

     - have ArrowPoint maintain for the benefit of ArrowPoint's current
       directors and officers and other persons covered by ArrowPoint's current
       directors' and officers' liability insurance with respect to all matters
       occurring on or prior to the completion of the merger, directors and
       officers

                                       50
<PAGE>   57

       liability insurance on terms substantially equivalent to the ArrowPoint
       directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in effect on the date
       of the merger agreement.

INTERESTS OF ARROWPOINT DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND AFFILIATES IN THE MERGER

     In considering the recommendation of the ArrowPoint board of directors, you
should be aware that certain directors and officers of ArrowPoint have interests
in the merger which are different from, or in addition to, yours. The ArrowPoint
board of directors was aware of these potential conflicts and considered them.
These interests include the following:


     - As of March 31, 2000, directors and executive officers of ArrowPoint and
       their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 52.0% of the
       outstanding shares of ArrowPoint common stock. Please see "Principal
       Stockholders of ArrowPoint" on page 74 of this proxy statement/
       prospectus for more information.


     - As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, non-employee directors
       of ArrowPoint beneficially owned stock options to purchase an aggregate
       of 60,000 shares of ArrowPoint common stock, all of which were unvested.
       Upon completion of the merger, 50% of the unvested stock options held by
       the following non-employee directors will accelerate and become fully
       vested and exercisable as shown below:

       As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, executive officers
       (including employee directors) beneficially owned 3,940,000 shares of
       restricted stock, subject to stock restriction agreements and a
       repurchase option by ArrowPoint. Upon completion of the merger, 50% of
       the unvested shares held by the following executive officers will
       accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable as shown below:

       The acceleration of the vesting of options upon the merger, together with
       any other payment contingent upon or made in connection with the merger
       may result in "excess parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G of
       the Internal Revenue Code. Excess parachute payments are not deductible
       in accordance with Section 280G. As a result, Cisco will not be entitled
       to a tax deduction for the amounts determined to be excess parachute
       payments. The amount of the lost deduction will depend on the value of
       the shares at the time of the merger, the number of option shares being
       accelerated, plus the amount of any payments deemed to be made in
       connection with the merger.

     - Several employees and executive officers, as a condition to closing of
       the merger, are required to enter into employment and non-competition
       agreements with Cisco that will become effective upon completion of the
       merger. Please see summary of the terms of their employment agreements in
       the section entitled "Employment and Non-Competition Agreements" under
       "The Merger and Related Transactions -- Related Agreements" on page 47 of
       the proxy statement/prospectus.

     - The merger agreement provides that Cisco will indemnify, from and after
       the effective time, and will cause ArrowPoint to indemnify the present
       and former officers, directors and employees and agents of ArrowPoint in
       respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the effective time,
       in each case to the fullest extent the corporation is permitted under
       Delaware law, the ArrowPoint amended and restated certificate of
       incorporation or the ArrowPoint amended and restated bylaws, in each case
       as in effect on the date of the merger agreement. Please see the section
       above entitled "Indemnification and Insurance" on page 50 of this proxy
       statement/prospectus.

ANTITRUST APPROVAL


     The merger is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 which prevents some transactions from being
completed until required information and materials are furnished to the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
and certain waiting periods end or expire.


     However, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal
Trade Commission may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds either before or
after expiration of the waiting period. Accordingly, at any time before or after
the completion of the merger, either the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or the Federal Trade Commission could take action under the antitrust
laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, or other persons
could take action under the

                                       52
<PAGE>   59

antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the merger. Additionally, at any
time before or after the completion of the merger, notwithstanding that the
applicable waiting period expired or ended, any state could take action under
the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest.
There can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger will not be made or
that, if a challenge is made, we will prevail.

     In addition, Cisco and ArrowPoint may need to obtain approval for the
merger in foreign jurisdictions depending upon the extent that ArrowPoint
conducts business in these jurisdictions and the statutory requirements of each
of these jurisdictions.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

     The following discussion describes the material United States federal
income tax considerations relevant to the exchange of shares of ArrowPoint
common stock for Cisco common stock pursuant to the merger that are generally
applicable to holders of ArrowPoint common stock. This discussion is based on
currently existing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, existing and
proposed treasury regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and
court decisions, all of which are subject to change. Any change, which may or
may not be retroactive, could alter the tax consequences to ArrowPoint
stockholders as described herein.

     ArrowPoint stockholders should be aware that this discussion does not deal
with all federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to particular
ArrowPoint stockholders in light of their particular circumstances, such as
stockholders who are dealers in securities, who are subject to the alternative
minimum tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, who are foreign persons,
who do not hold their ArrowPoint common stock as capital assets or who acquired
their shares in connection with stock option or stock purchase plans or in other
compensatory transactions. In addition, the following discussion does not
address the tax consequences of the merger under foreign, state or local tax
laws, the tax consequences of transactions effectuated prior or subsequent to,
or concurrently with, the merger (whether or not any such transactions are
undertaken in connection with the merger), including without limitation any
transaction in which shares of ArrowPoint common stock are acquired or shares of
Cisco common stock are disposed of, the tax consequences of the assumption by
Cisco of the outstanding ArrowPoint stock options or the tax consequences of the
receipt of rights to acquire Cisco common stock. Accordingly, ARROWPOINT
STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX
CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE,
LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES.

     The merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
the Internal Revenue Code. If the merger does qualify as a reorganization, then,
subject to the limitations and qualifications referred to herein, the merger
will generally result in the following federal income tax consequences to the
ArrowPoint stockholders:

     - No gain or loss will be recognized by holders of ArrowPoint common stock
       solely upon their receipt of Cisco common stock in exchange for
       ArrowPoint common stock in the merger (except to the extent of cash
       received in lieu of a fractional share of Cisco common stock).

     - The aggregate tax basis of the Cisco common stock received by ArrowPoint
       stockholders in the merger (including any tax basis attributable to
       fractional shares deemed to be disposed of) will be the same as the
       aggregate tax basis of the ArrowPoint common stock surrendered in
       exchange therefor.

                                       53
<PAGE>   60

     - The holding period of the Cisco common stock received by each ArrowPoint
       stockholder in the merger will include the period for which the
       ArrowPoint common stock surrendered in exchange therefor was considered
       to be held, provided that the ArrowPoint common stock so surrendered is
       held as a capital asset at the time of the merger.

     - Cash payments received by holders of ArrowPoint common stock in lieu of a
       fractional share will be treated as if the fractional share of Cisco
       common stock had been issued in the merger and then redeemed by Cisco. An
       ArrowPoint stockholder receiving cash payments will recognize gain or
       loss, upon payment, measured by the difference, if any, between the
       amount of cash received and the basis in the fractional share.

     The parties are not requesting and will not request a ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service as to the tax consequences of the merger. The
consummation of the merger is conditioned on the receipt by Cisco of an opinion
from Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP or Hale and Dorr LLP and the receipt by
ArrowPoint of an opinion from Hale and Dorr LLP or Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison
LLP to the effect that the merger will constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of the Internal Revenue Code.

     ArrowPoint stockholders should be aware that the tax opinions do not bind
the Internal Revenue Service and the Internal Revenue Service is therefore not
precluded from successfully asserting a contrary opinion. The tax opinions will
be subject to certain assumptions and qualifications, including the truth and
accuracy of certain representations made by Cisco, ArrowPoint and Archer
Acquisition Corporation.

     A successful Internal Revenue Service challenge to the reorganization
status of the merger would result in ArrowPoint stockholders recognizing taxable
gain or loss with respect to each share of common stock of ArrowPoint
surrendered equal to the difference between the stockholder's basis in the share
and the fair market value, as of the merger, of the Cisco common stock received
in exchange therefor. In this event, a stockholder's aggregate basis in the
Cisco common stock so received would equal its fair market value, and the
stockholder's capital gains holding period for such stock would begin the day
after the merger.

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

     We intend to account for the merger as a pooling of interests business
combination. It is a condition to completion of the merger that Cisco be advised
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement can properly be accounted for as a pooling of interests business
combination, although this condition may be waived. It is also a condition to
completion of the merger that ArrowPoint shall be advised by Arthur Andersen LLP
that it qualifies as a combining company in a pooling of interests business
combination, although this condition may be waived by Cisco.

NO DISSENTERS' OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     You are not entitled to exercise dissenter's or appraisal rights as a
result of the merger or to demand payment for your shares under Delaware law.

RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OF SHARES BY AFFILIATES OF ARROWPOINT AND CISCO

     The shares of Cisco common stock to be issued in connection with the merger
will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and will be freely
transferable under the Securities Act, except for shares of Cisco common stock
issued to any person who is deemed to be an affiliate of either Cisco or
ArrowPoint at the time of the special meeting. Persons who may be deemed to be
affiliates include

                                       54
<PAGE>   61

individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control of either Cisco or ArrowPoint and may include some of our officers and
directors, as well as our principal stockholders. Affiliates may not sell their
shares of Cisco common stock acquired in connection with the merger except
pursuant to:

     - an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
       resale of those shares;

     - an exemption under paragraph (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act; or

     - another applicable exemption under the Securities Act.

     Cisco's registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, does not cover the resale of shares of Cisco
common stock to be received by affiliates in the merger.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
          FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF ARROWPOINT

     The following discussion and analysis of ArrowPoint's financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with ArrowPoint's
financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in
this proxy statement/prospectus.

OVERVIEW


     ArrowPoint provides intelligent Web switches that enable its customers to
deploy a global Web network architecture to optimize e-commerce transactions and
the delivery of Web content. Using patented technology, ArrowPoint's switches
intelligently route requests for Web content or transactions to the network
server that is best able to handle the request at that moment. ArrowPoint
derived its revenue through March 31, 2000 from both the sale of its CS-100 and
CS-800 Web switches and the sale of technical support contracts. ArrowPoint's
customers consist of end-users, distributors, resellers, and original equipment
manufacturers, known as OEMs. ArrowPoint expanded its international activities
in Europe, Latin America and the Asia/Pacific market significantly in 1999 and
in the quarter ended March 31, 2000, and plans to continue to do so in 2000.



     ArrowPoint has incurred significant net losses since inception and, as of
March 31, 2000, had an accumulated deficit of $39.0 million. ArrowPoint has not
achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, and anticipates that it
will continue to incur net losses through 2000. ArrowPoint expects to increase
its sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative
expenses and, as a result, will need to generate significant revenue to achieve
and maintain profitability. Although ArrowPoint has achieved rapid growth in
revenue in recent periods, it may not be able to sustain these growth rates in
the future.


     ArrowPoint recorded a total of $26.4 million of deferred compensation costs
since its inception through March 31, 2000. These amounts represent the
difference between the exercise price or purchase price of stock options granted
or stock sold to ArrowPoint employees and the deemed fair value of ArrowPoint
common stock at the time of grant or sale. ArrowPoint is amortizing these
amounts over the vesting period of the options and restricted stock awards,
which is generally five years. ArrowPoint recorded stock-based compensation
expense of $2.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2000 and $104,000 for
the quarter ended March 31, 1999.

     ArrowPoint recorded a charge to accumulated deficit of approximately $6.5
million in the quarter ended March 31, 2000. This amount represents the value of
the beneficial conversion feature of the Series E convertible preferred stock.
This amount has been accounted for like a dividend to preferred stockholders
and, as a result, increased the ArrowPoint's net loss available to common
stockholders and the related net loss per share for the quarter ended March 31,
2000.


     In light of the rapidly evolving nature of ArrowPoint's business and its
limited operating history, it believes that period-to-period comparisons of
revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be
relied upon as indications of future performance. This is particularly true of
companies such as ArrowPoint that operate in new and rapidly evolving markets.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 1999 AND 2000

  Revenue

     ArrowPoint has derived revenue from the sale of its CS-100 and CS-800
products and related technical support contracts and services. Revenue increased
by $8.8 million from $737,000 in the first

                                       57
<PAGE>   64

quarter of 1999 to $9.5 million in the first quarter of 2000. This increase was
due primarily to an increase in the quantity of ArrowPoint products sold.
Substantially all of the increase in revenue was comprised of product revenue
with the majority of the increase attributable to new customers. Revenue derived
from customers located outside of the United States was 48% in the first quarter
of 2000, as compared to 61% in the first quarter of 1999.

  Cost of Revenue

     Cost of revenue consists of material, assembly, test and overhead costs
incurred to produce ArrowPoint's products. Cost of revenue increased by $3.1
million from $501,000 in the first quarter of 1999 to $3.6 million in the first
quarter of 2000. Gross margin increased from 32% in the first quarter of 1999 to
63% in the first quarter of 2000 due to higher production volumes that resulted
in cost efficiencies for both material and overhead costs.

  Sales and Marketing

     ArrowPoint's sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
compensation, travel, recruiting, advertising, and field sales office expenses.
ArrowPoint's sales and marketing expenses increased by $6.4 million from $1.3
million in the first quarter of 1999 to $7.7 million in the first quarter of
2000. This increase was due primarily to investing in its sales and marketing
infrastructure, both domestically and internationally. These investments
included an increase in ArrowPoint's sales, marketing and customer support
resulting in an increase in compensation expenses, an increase in recruiting
expenses, an increase in travel expenses, increased field sales office expenses,
and marketing activities, including advertising, trade shows and other
promotional expenses from the first quarter of 1999 to the first quarter of
2000. Sales and marketing expenses decreased from 176% of revenue in the first
quarter of 1999 to 81% of revenue in the first quarter of 2000. ArrowPoint
expects sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis in
future periods.

  Research and Development

     ArrowPoint's research and development expenses consist primarily of
compensation, depreciation and office expenses. ArrowPoint's research and
development expenses increased by $1.0 million from $1.3 million in the first
quarter of 1999 to $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2000. This increase was
due primarily to an increase in ArrowPoint's software engineers and other
technical staff resulting in an increase in compensation expenses, and
depreciation expense. Research and development expenses decreased from 182% of
revenue in the first quarter of 1999 to 24% of revenue in the first quarter of
2000. ArrowPoint believes continued investment in research and development is
essential to attaining its strategic objectives, and as a result, ArrowPoint
expects research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar
basis in future periods.

  General and Administrative

     General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for
general and administrative personnel, depreciation, and professional fees.
ArrowPoint's general and administrative expenses increased by $584,000 from
$350,000 in the first quarter of 1999 to $934,000 in the first quarter of 2000.
This increase was due primarily to an increase in general and administrative
personnel resulting in increased compensation expense. General and
administrative costs decreased from 47% of revenue in the first quarter of 1999
to 10% of revenue in the first quarter of 2000. ArrowPoint expects general and
administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis in future
periods.

                                       58
<PAGE>   65

  Interest Income, Net

     Net interest income increased by $138,000 from $100,000 in the first
quarter of 1999 to $238,000 in the first quarter of 2000. This increase was due
primarily to increased cash and cash equivalents balances as a result of
ArrowPoint's Series E preferred stock financing in January 2000.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1999

  Revenue

     ArrowPoint first shipped its CS-100 product in the fourth quarter of 1998.
Revenue increased by $12.2 million from $201,000 in 1998 to $12.4 million in
1999. This increase was due to growth in sales of the CS-100 since its
commercial introduction in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the CS-800 since its
commercial introduction in the first quarter of 1999 as well as further
development of ArrowPoint's sales channels. Approximately 92.0% of the increase
in revenue was attributable to revenue from new customers. Substantially all of
the revenue increase was comprised of product revenue, as service revenue
represented only approximately 1.0% of total revenue in 1999. Sales of the
CS-100 represented 42.0% of revenue and sales of the CS-800 represented 57.0% of
revenue in 1999.

  Cost of Revenue

     Cost of revenue increased by $5.0 million from $150,000 in 1998 to $5.1
million in 1999 as a result of the increased volume of sales. Gross margin
increased from 25% to 59% due to higher production volumes that resulted in cost
efficiencies for both material and overhead costs.

  Sales and Marketing

     ArrowPoint's sales and marketing expenses increased from $3.1 million in
1998 to $9.9 million in 1999. This increase was due primarily to investing in
ArrowPoint's sales and marketing infrastructure, both domestically and
internationally. These investments included an increase in ArrowPoint's sales,
marketing and customer support personnel from 18 at December 31, 1998 to 73 at
December 31, 1999 resulting in an increase in compensation expenses of $4.2
million, an increase in travel expenses of $839,000, and an increase in other
sales and marketing activities resulting in increased expenses of $1.8 million.
Sales and marketing expenses were 80% of revenue in 1999. ArrowPoint expects
sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis in future
periods.

  Research and Development

     ArrowPoint's research and development expenses increased from $5.9 million
in 1998 to $6.4 million in 1999. This increase was due primarily to an increase
in ArrowPoint's software engineers and other technical staff from 30 at December
31, 1998 to 50 at December 31, 1999 resulting in an increase in compensation
expenses of $1.4 million and an increase in depreciation expense of $303,000,
partially offset by a reduction in spending for prototype materials of $1.1
million from 1998 to 1999. Research and development expenses were 52% of revenue
in 1999. ArrowPoint believes continued investment in research and development is
essential to attaining ArrowPoint's strategic objectives, and as a result,
ArrowPoint expects research and development expenses to increase on an absolute
dollar basis in future periods.

  General and Administrative

     ArrowPoint's general and administrative expenses increased from $924,000 in
1998 to $1.7 million in 1999. This increase was due primarily to an increase in
general and administrative personnel from 6 at December 31, 1998 to 16 at
December 31, 1999 resulting in increased compensation expenses of

                                       59
<PAGE>   66

$325,000, increased depreciation expense of $143,000 and increased professional
and other expenses of $298,000. General and administrative costs were 14% of
revenue in 1999. ArrowPoint expects general and administrative expenses to
increase on an absolute dollar basis in future periods.

  Interest income, net

     Net interest income was $517,000 in 1999 compared to net interest income of
$402,000 in 1998. This increase was due primarily to increased cash and cash
equivalents balances as a result of ArrowPoint's Series D preferred stock
financing in February 1999.

PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (APRIL 14, 1997) TO DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1998

  Revenue

     ArrowPoint derived $201,000 of revenue in 1998 from the initial sales of
ArrowPoint's CS-100 product in the fourth quarter of 1998. ArrowPoint recorded
no revenue for the period from inception (April 14, 1997) to December 31, 1997.

  Cost of Revenue

     ArrowPoint recorded no cost of revenue for the period from inception to
December 31, 1997. Cost of revenue was $150,000 in 1998 reflecting costs of the
initial sales of ArrowPoint's CS-100 product. Gross margin of 25% reflects the
start-up costs of manufacturing and lower production levels during this period.

  Sales and Marketing

     ArrowPoint's sales and marketing expenses increased from $137,000 for the
period from inception to December 31, 1997, to $3.1 million in 1998. This
increase was due primarily to investing in ArrowPoint's sales and marketing
infrastructure. These investments included an increase in ArrowPoint's sales,
marketing and customer support personnel with an increase in compensation and
recruiting expenses of $1.4 million, an increase in travel expenses of $284,000,
and increased other sales and marketing activities, including advertising, trade
shows and other promotional expenses, resulting in increased expenses of $1.2
million.

  Research and Development

     ArrowPoint's research and development expenses increased from $2.5 million
for the period from inception to December 31, 1997, to $5.9 million in 1998.
This increase was due primarily to an increase in ArrowPoint's personnel
resulting in an increase in compensation expenses of $1.4 million, an increase
in prototyping materials expenses of $1.0 million and an increase in other
related expenses of $1.0 million.

  General and Administrative

     ArrowPoint's general and administrative expenses increased from $366,000
for the period of inception to December 31, 1997 to $924,000 in 1998. This
increase was due primarily to an increase in general and administrative
personnel resulting in an increase in compensation expenses of $331,000 and an
increase in professional and other expenses of $227,000.

                                       60
<PAGE>   67

  Interest Income, Net

     Net interest income was $140,000 in the period from inception to December
31, 1997 compared to net interest income of $402,000 in 1998. This increase was
due primarily to increased cash and cash equivalents received from the sale of
ArrowPoint's Series B preferred stock in February 1998.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     From ArrowPoint's inception through March 31, 2000, ArrowPoint financed its
operations and capital expenditures primarily through the sale of approximately
$48.4 million in equity securities and borrowings of $1.7 million. On April 5,
2000 ArrowPoint received cash proceeds, net of underwriters' discount and
offering expenses, totaling approximately $180.4 million upon the closing of its
initial public offering.

     ArrowPoint has a $2 million equipment line of credit and a $5 million
accounts receivable line of credit with Fleet National Bank with interest rates
of approximately 9.5% as of March 31, 2000. In March 2000 equipment line
borrowings of $1.7 million were repaid and at March 31, 2000, ArrowPoint had no
borrowings under the equipment or accounts receivable lines of credit.

     Cash used in ArrowPoint's operating activities was $2.9 million for the
quarter ended March 31, 1999, and $6.9 million for the quarter ended March 31,
2000. These net cash outflows resulted from operating losses as well as
increases in accounts receivable and inventory due to increased sales. They were
partially offset by an increase in the amortization of deferred compensation of
$2.8 million along with increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and
deferred revenues.

     Cash used in investing activities was $366,000 for the quarter ended March
31, 1999, and $2.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2000, substantially
all of which was used for the purchase of property and equipment, primarily
computers and test equipment for our development and manufacturing activities.
ArrowPoint expects capital expenditures to continue to increase through the year
2000, due to the costs of expansion and expenditures for computers and test
equipment.

     Cash used in our operating activities was $2.4 million for 1997, $10.0
million for 1998 and $9.4 million for 1999. These net cash outflows resulted
primarily from operating losses because:

     - in 1997 our operating expenses of $3.0 million exceeded our revenue of
       zero;

     - in 1998 our operating expenses of $9.9 million exceeded our revenue of
       $200,000; and

     - in 1999 our operating expenses of $20.4 million, which included
       incremental spending increases of $6.8 million on sales and marketing,
       $535,000 on research and development and $766,000 on general and
       administrative, exceeded our revenue of $12.4 million.

     The net cash outflow in 1999 also resulted from accounts receivable and
inventory increasing by $4.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively, from 1998
to 1999. Accounts receivable at December 31, 1999 were approximately 79.0% of
revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 1999 due primarily to the large
portion of sales occurring during the second half of the quarter and the level
of international sales, which generally have longer standard payment terms than
domestic sales. The increases in accounts receivable and inventory were
partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $2.7 million, accrued
liabilities of $1.3 million and deferred revenue of $2.5 million, from 1998 to
1999.

     Cash used in investing activities was $608,000 for 1997, $1.5 million for
1998 and $3.6 million for 1999, substantially all of which was used for the
purchase of property and equipment, primarily computers and test equipment for
our development and manufacturing activities and leasehold improvements.

                                       61
<PAGE>   68

     As of March 31, 2000, ArrowPoint had obligations outstanding under various
operating leases. In August 1999 ArrowPoint agreed to lease approximately 45,000
square feet, as its headquarters, in a facility located in Acton, Massachusetts
for a term of five years. The annual cost of this lease is approximately
$817,000, subject to annual adjustments. Although ArrowPoint has no other
material commitments, it anticipates a substantial increase in its lease
commitments consistent with anticipated growth in ArrowPoint operations,
infrastructure and personnel. In the future ArrowPoint may also require a larger
inventory of products in order to provide better availability to customers and
achieve purchasing efficiencies. ArrowPoint expects that the net proceeds from
its recent public offering, its existing cash balances and amounts available
under its credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its currently anticipated
working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 18 months.

NET OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS

     As of December 31, 1999, ArrowPoint had approximately $20.6 million of net
operating loss carryforwards and $1.1 million of tax credit carryforwards
available to offset future taxable income. These carryforwards expire at various
dates through 2019, to the extent that they are not utilized. Utilization of
these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due to ownership change
provisions. A 100% valuation allowance has been recorded against the related
deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of these
assets.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
133 of Financial Accounting Standards, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities." This statement requires that all derivative instruments
be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value
of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as a part
of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. In July
1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133."
SFAS No. 137 deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 until fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. ArrowPoint does not currently use derivative
instruments. Therefore ArrowPoint does not expect the adoption of this statement
to have any significant effect on ArrowPoint's results of operations or
financial position.

MARKET RISK

     ArrowPoint does not currently use derivative financial instruments.
ArrowPoint generally places its marketable security investments in high credit
quality instruments, primarily U.S. Government obligations with contractual
maturities of less than one year. ArrowPoint does not expect to have any
material loss from its marketable security investments and therefore believes
that its potential interest rate exposure is not material.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

EVOLUTION OF THE WEB AND E-COMMERCE

     The emergence of the Web has enabled the delivery of information and rich
media content and the sale of products and services to a worldwide audience.
According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, an information technology
industry analyst, the number of e-commerce users with access to the Web will
grow from an estimated 142 million at the end of 1998 to 502 million by the end
of 2003. To attract and retain these users, companies are continually increasing
the amount and the sophistication of the information and services offered on
their Web sites. Most leading Web sites offer one or more of the following:

     - personalized information, such as individual stock portfolios or custom
       home pages;

     - rich media content, such as audio and video; and

     - e-commerce transactions, such as electronic ordering, order status and
       bill payment.

     Accompanying the growth of the Web has been a dramatic increase in the
amount of e-commerce taking place over the Web. According to a report by IDC,
e-commerce revenue is expected to increase from $50 billion in 1998 to over $1.3
trillion in 2003. To be successful, companies conducting e-commerce must
effectively manage their Web site traffic and provide visitors with a positive
experience.

     In response to the rapid growth in the number and complexity of Web sites
and e-commerce and the significance of the Internet to the business strategies
of many companies, a Web hosting industry has developed. According to IDC, the
Web hosting market will expand from $823 million during 1998 to $18.9 billion by
2003. Web hosting companies manage a company's Web servers at data centers with
high-speed Internet connectivity and provide the hosted company with the
benefits of high-bandwidth access to its Web site without having to build its
own network. Web hosting companies are increasingly offering services in
addition to Web connectivity, including content development, Web site
management,

                                       63
<PAGE>   70

disaster recovery and various service guarantees. In addition, many Web hosting
companies are either providing on-line software applications directly to their
customers or providing Web hosting services to other application service
providers, which in turn provide on-line software applications to other
companies. The increasing complexity and scalability requirements of
business-critical Web sites and the emergence of Web hosting companies are
creating new opportunities to provide infrastructure products and services for
complex Web networks and applications.

TODAY'S WEB SITE INFRASTRUCTURE

     Web sites today typically consist of multiple types of servers, providing
the following functions:

     - Web servers provide the primary interface for visitors to the Web site;

     - application servers provide a platform for application-specific
       processing such as personalized services or on-line shopping;

     - secure servers are used for encrypted operations such as credit card
       processing or viewing account information;

     - database servers provide centralized information repositories; and

     - cache servers store copies of frequently accessed files to improve
       response to requests for those files.

     These servers are connected by traditional networking devices such as
switches and routers. As Web traffic volume increases, the performance of any
individual server can degrade. By copying applications and data to multiple
servers of the same type, a company can provide increased capacity and
performance for its Web site as a whole. Load balancing devices, typically
PC-based servers, are then used to distribute the traffic among these multiple
servers.

     Traditional load balancing devices operate by intercepting data packets
addressed to a Web site and translating the destination address of the packets
to the address of the server. If a particular server is unavailable, the load
balancing device stops using its address as a destination and routes the packet
to another server. Due to the limited performance of PC platforms, these load
balancing devices can themselves become overloaded, reducing the performance and
response time of the Web site. In addition, because these devices base their
decisions on packet address information, they cannot determine the identity of
the user or what content the user is trying to access. This is because the
information that uniquely identifies users and content is located much deeper
inside the packets. Although manufacturers of traditional switching equipment
have attempted to address some of the performance issues of PC-based load
balancing products by introducing load-balancing capabilities to their switches,
these switches were not designed for this task and typically suffer from serious
performance limitations of their own. In addition, like PC-based load balancers,
these devices are "content blind" -- that is, they are unaware of the user's
identity or the specific content being requested.

     These existing solutions do not adequately address the problems confronting
complex Web sites today because they are unable to do all of the following:

     - provide e-commerce transaction integrity by ensuring server continuity to
       avoid problems such as lost electronic shopping carts;

     - provide special treatment to certain content requests based upon
       information such as the identity of the requester or the type of content
       requested;

                                       64
<PAGE>   71

     - maximize the efficiency of Web servers, application servers, databases,
       caches and firewalls by routing requests to the best server to handle
       that type of request;

     - detect and handle flash crowds -- that is, a sudden surge of requests for
       a piece of Web content such as a breaking news story -- by identifying
       hot content and creating additional ways to access this hot content;

     - route traffic around failed servers, applications or content;

     - block denial-of-service attacks by computer hackers, which are attempts
       to disable servers or keep the servers busy performing useless tasks so
       that other users of the site are denied service;

     - improve the scalability, performance and reliability of high-end Web
       sites; and

     - provide systems administrators with data about content and application
       performance.

     The rapid growth in the use of the Web and in e-commerce, coupled with the
increase in Web site complexity, has put tremendous pressure on companies to
develop new Web network architectures that can efficiently and effectively
address the problems described above.

ARROWPOINT SOLUTION


     ArrowPoint's intelligent Web switches are used by companies such as Web
hosting and application service providers, e-commerce companies and Internet
service providers to deploy a Web network architecture that optimizes e-commerce
transactions and the delivery of Web content. Using ArrowPoint's technology, its
customers can significantly improve the experience of visitors to their Web
sites.



     ArrowPoint's intelligent Web switches enable its customers to deploy a Web
network architecture that offers the following benefits:


E-COMMERCE TRANSACTION ASSURANCE

     E-commerce transactions depend on the ability of the server and the
application to maintain information about the purchaser's transaction until the
transaction is completed. For example, a purchaser may initiate several requests
while browsing through a Web site and adding items to an electronic shopping
cart. The items in the shopping cart must be maintained on the server until
checkout. To accomplish this, it is critical to ensure that a purchaser's
requests are always directed to the same server until the transaction is
complete. ArrowPoint's intelligent Web switches, unlike traditional switches,
are able to use information located deep within the purchaser's Web request to
continually direct the purchaser to the correct server, preventing problems such
as lost electronic shopping carts.

SPECIALIZED TREATMENT BASED ON CONTENT, APPLICATION OR USER

     ArrowPoint's Web switches can direct traffic to specific servers or groups
of servers based on a range of different information about the requesting party
or the Web content or transaction requested. This feature enables companies to
give preferred or differing treatment to specific users, such as preferred
customers. In addition, this feature enables companies to distinguish among Web
requests based on the nature of the request, such as giving requests for
revenue-generating transactions priority over requests for information.

                                       65
<PAGE>   72

OPTIMIZED CONTENT DELIVERY

     Poor Web site performance can disrupt Web transactions and cause user
dissatisfaction, resulting in lost revenue for e-commerce companies and other
businesses dependent on their Web sites. Using information about the requesting
party, the Web content or transaction requested and the customer's Web network,
ArrowPoint's intelligent Web switches can direct requests for Web content or
transactions to the network server -- which may be part of a globally dispersed
network -- best able to handle that request at that moment. This enables
ArrowPoint's customers to provide dynamic Web content from Web servers, static
content from caches, and streaming audio and video from optimized streaming
servers. These capabilities optimize Web performance and content delivery and
enhance the experience of visitors to the Web site.

FLASH CROWD INSURANCE

     The popularity of a particular piece of Web content changes from moment to
moment. At a news service Web site, for example, a breaking news story can cause
a sudden surge of requests for that story that overwhelms the site's Web
servers. It is often difficult to predict which content will be popular and to
provide additional servers in anticipation of flash crowds. ArrowPoint's Web
switches can identify hot content and automatically trigger the copying of that
content to servers or caches to dynamically add capacity to handle flash crowds.
This enables ArrowPoint's customers to cost-efficiently maximize the number of
Web requests they can satisfy.

IMPROVED AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT

     Even when a Web site is available, a particular server or application at
that site may still fail. ArrowPoint's Web switches can recognize this and
intelligently redirect requests for unavailable content or applications to
another Web site or server which has the requested information.

ENHANCED SITE SECURITY

     While firewalls can effectively perform many security functions for a
customer's network, they are less well-suited to the protection of Web sites, as
most companies want to encourage rather than restrict access to their Web sites.
Firewalls generally do not provide effective protection against
denial-of-service attacks -- which are attempts by computer hackers to disable
servers or keep servers busy performing useless tasks -- without significantly
impairing the performance of the Web site. ArrowPoint's switches are able to
differentiate between legitimate Web requests and denial-of-service attacks. In
addition, ArrowPoint's switches can be used to improve the performance of
traditional firewalls through load balancing.

SUPERIOR SCALABILITY, PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY


     ArrowPoint's Web switches are designed to address the needs of ArrowPoint's
customers, which range from smaller Web sites to large, complex Web hosting
operations. In addition, ArrowPoint's different product offerings and flexible
software architecture enable customers to easily deploy additional ArrowPoint
switches as their Web networks expand, without having to replace their existing
ArrowPoint switches. ArrowPoint's switches were designed for the strict
reliability standards of telecommunications networks, and an individual CS-800
Web switch can handle approximately three billion Web requests in a 24-hour
period. In addition, ArrowPoint's products include features and components to
enhance the reliability of its customers' Web sites and the availability of
their content.

PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND CAPACITY PLANNING

     ArrowPoint's products track detailed statistics about the performance of
ArrowPoint's customers' networks, servers, applications and content, which can
be used to operate their Web sites more efficiently and plan more effectively
for growth. This information can be accessed from any standard network
management system.

PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY

     ArrowPoint believes it offers the most advanced Web switching solution for
optimizing e-commerce transactions and the delivery of Web content. The
principal components of ArrowPoint's technology consist of:

     - a patented technique for intelligently routing Web requests, which
       ArrowPoint calls content switching;

     - a powerful and scalable software operating system; and

     - a high-performance switching architecture that enables ArrowPoint to
       rapidly benefit from new and better-performing commercially available
       microprocessors.

CONTENT SWITCHING TECHNOLOGY

     ArrowPoint has developed a patented technique for routing a Web content
request to the server within a network of distributed servers that is best able
to handle that request. ArrowPoint calls this technique content switching.
ArrowPoint's switches intelligently route requests based on an analysis of user
and content identification information found in the request and information
about the performance and availability of eligible servers.

     Unlike traditional switching technology, which makes routing and policy
decisions based on Internet protocol, or IP, addresses, ArrowPoint's content
switching also makes use of detailed information available only through the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, the data transfer protocol of the World
Wide Web. In particular, ArrowPoint's switches use the following information
found through HTTP as part of the content switching process:

     - Uniform Resource Locator, or URL -- This information uniquely identifies
       the specific file requested from the server or the specific operation to
       be performed.

     - Host header -- This information uniquely identifies the requested host.

     - Cookie -- "Cookies" have a variety of uses, but are generally used by Web
       applications to maintain information about users. A cookie is a small
       file of information about a user's transaction that a Web server places
       on a user's computer; the user returns the cookie in subsequent Web
       requests to the same site, which ArrowPoint's switches can use to direct
       the user to the correct server. This allows the site to maintain
       information about a user's transactions that spans multiple HTTP
       requests.

     The policies ArrowPoint's Web switches can apply based on this information
are very flexible, allowing ArrowPoint's customers to customize their Web sites
and to optimize them for peak performance.

SOFTWARE

     ArrowPoint has invested significant resources in the development of its
software, which runs on its CS-50, CS-150 and CS-800 switches. ArrowPoint's
software enables many of the important customer

                                       67
<PAGE>   74


benefits offered by its Web switches. Because so much of ArrowPoint's technology
is embedded in its software platform, it can easily add functionality and
features to its products through software upgrades, which enables its customers
to benefit from its technological developments without having to replace their
existing ArrowPoint switches.


     Among the many technologies and features contained in ArrowPoint's
operating system software are the following:

     - ArrowPoint's Web switches facilitate e-commerce transactions by
       maintaining information across multiple HTTP requests to a Web site. This
       is done by "sticking" the user to the same server until the transaction
       is complete. This "stickyness" can be accomplished by matching on the IP
       address, URL, cookie or the secure socket layer session ID.

     - ArrowPoint's Web switches allow customers to deploy distributed networks
       of servers and/or caches, leveraging those servers as a shared resource
       that can be used to accelerate the delivery of content around the world.

     - ArrowPoint's Web switches can be configured to restrict access to a Web
       site based on IP address, URL, host header or cookie. In addition,
       ArrowPoint's operating system filters out common denial-of-service
       attacks and notifies Web site operators about security violations so they
       can take corrective action.

     - ArrowPoint's customers can configure ArrowPoint's switches to load
       balance among local servers using a number of industry-standard
       algorithms, as well as an advanced algorithm developed by us. These load
       balancing algorithms can be invoked based on IP address, Internet domain
       name, URL or any combination of these identifications. This allows
       ArrowPoint's customers to adopt extremely flexible policies, which they
       can use to partition content by type, directory or individual file name.

     - ArrowPoint's software enables its switches to intelligently route content
       requests to the optimal site and server for that request based on what
       content is being requested, who is requesting it and where the requestor
       is located. ArrowPoint's global load balancing methods take into account
       information the switches have learned about content location,
       availability and proximity to the requesting user. ArrowPoint's switches
       use a proprietary protocol to maintain and communicate information about
       a variety of relevant data, including the performance of not only the
       local servers attached to them but all other servers and switches in the
       network. This enables distributed calculation of best site and server
       information.

     - ArrowPoint's switches can automatically replicate content when it is
       added or changed on a server or, alternatively, when the access frequency
       for a particular piece of content exceeds a user-defined threshold.

CONTENT SWITCHING ARCHITECTURE


     ArrowPoint has developed a distributed processing architecture for content
switching that leverages multiple specialized processors in a way that optimizes
the system for specific tasks. Arriving Web content requests are analyzed by an
array of general-purpose microprocessors, which then determine where to send the
content request based on what content is being requested and who is requesting
it. Once a request is analyzed and the best server is selected, the content is
delivered by special-purpose network processors, which are optimized for packet
forwarding. This content switching architecture allows ArrowPoint to offer
products that combine a high degree of content intelligence with high-
performance and cost-effectiveness. In addition, ArrowPoint's architecture is
highly scalable, enabling it to add new features for higher performance without
modifying the underlying architecture.

     The CS-150 is designed for moderate traffic Web sites. It is comprised of
12 or 16 100-megabit ports and two Gigabit Ethernet ports. The CS-150 offers
more than three times the performance of the CS-100. The CS-150 is priced
starting at $17,995.

     The CS-800 is a high-performance switching chassis designed for large Web
sites and Web hosting operations. Each CS-800 can support up to 64 100-megabit
Ethernet interfaces or 32 gigabit Ethernet interfaces interconnected by a 20
gigabit per second switching fabric. It features redundant power supplies,
switching fabrics and control logic. All systems modules, power supplies and
fans are field replaceable. The CS-800 was designed for the high performance,
reliability, availability and redundancy requirements of service providers and
telecommunications companies. The CS-800 is priced from $35,000 to $220,000
depending on configuration and software options.

     ArrowPoint's Web switches support its full range of content switching
capabilities. Each Web switch is based on ArrowPoint's content switching
architecture and combines the necessary performance and intelligence to enable
efficient, reliable and secure delivery of Web content. Customers can install
ArrowPoint's products without having to modify the hardware, software or content
of their Web site.

SALES AND MARKETING


     ArrowPoint sells its products through a direct sales force, distributors, a
network of resellers, including application service providers, and OEMs.
ArrowPoint believes that a direct sales force is critical for addressing its
largest customers and potential customers, helping to create demand in the
marketplace and generating an understanding of customer needs for use in product
development efforts. ArrowPoint uses its indirect channel to address accounts
with which those resellers have strategic relationships, smaller accounts and
geographic areas that are more efficiently addressed indirectly than directly.


     ArrowPoint is making a significant investment in its direct sales force.
ArrowPoint expects direct sales to account for a majority of its revenue in
2000. ArrowPoint's direct sales force is comprised of a series of sales teams,
consisting of a sales executive and a systems engineer. ArrowPoint has sales
personnel in a number of major metropolitan areas, including Atlanta, Boston,
Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York,
Philadelphia, San Jose, Seattle and Washington, D.C. ArrowPoint's international
sales personnel are located in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
Denmark, France, Germany, Greater China, Israel, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and the United
Kingdom. ArrowPoint's systems engineers support ArrowPoint's sales efforts by
working with potential customers to help them analyze the structure and needs of
their particular network and how best to configure and implement ArrowPoint's
Web switching solutions into their network.

     ArrowPoint also sells its products through the following indirect channels:

     - distributors, such as ACAL Nederland, NetOne Systems and Westcon;

     - traditional resellers, such as Case Technology, Cube Computer,
       Sumitronics and Telemation Netzwerke;

     - Web hosting and application service providers, such as Exodus
       Communications, GlobalCenter and NaviSite; and

     - OEMs, such as Alcatel and Zerowait.


     ArrowPoint's marketing organization utilizes a variety of programs to build
brand awareness, convey its value proposition and technology leadership position
and create demand for its products. ArrowPoint's marketing programs include:


     - seminars and trade shows;

     - market research and analysis;

     - product and strategy updates with industry analysts;

     - public relations activities and speaking engagements;

     - media advertisements;

World Online

     NaviSite accounted for 14% of ArrowPoint's revenue in 1999. Sales to
customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 47% of
ArrowPoint's revenue in 1999.

MANUFACTURING

     While ArrowPoint designs its products and develops its software in-house,
ArrowPoint subcontracts the manufacturing of its products to Plexus, an
independent manufacturer. Plexus assembles ArrowPoint's products, tests them,
stores and delivers them, and provides some field service to ArrowPoint's
customers. ArrowPoint's reliance on a single manufacturer exposes us to a number
of risks.


     In addition to managing ArrowPoint's relationship with Plexus, its internal
manufacturing group is responsible for the following functions which support the
manufacturing activities of Plexus:


     - vendor selection and management;

     - purchasing;

     - materials management and forecasting; and

     - quality assurance.


     Several key components of ArrowPoint's products are currently available
from only single vendors. The key components of ArrowPoint's products that it
purchases from single sources are:


     - critical network processors for the CS-50, CS-150 and the CS-800 from MMC
       Networks;

     - the power supply device for the CS-50 and CS-150 from Cherokee
       International; and

     - the power supply device for the CS-800 from Tectrol.

COMPETITION

     ArrowPoint competes primarily on the basis of:

     - the features and functionality of ArrowPoint's products, including their
       ability to analyze the content of Web requests;

                                       71
<PAGE>   78

     - the scalability of ArrowPoint's solutions;

     - the ease of installing, configuring and managing ArrowPoint's products;

     - the services ArrowPoint offers in support of its products; and

     - the ratio of performance to price for ArrowPoint's products.

     ArrowPoint believes that it currently competes effectively against its
competitors with respect to each of the competitive factors listed above.
However, ArrowPoint cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain its
competitive position in the future.

     The market for Internet infrastructure solutions is new, rapidly evolving
and very competitive. ArrowPoint expects competition in this market will
increase in the future. ArrowPoint's principal competitors include large
networking equipment companies such as Cisco Systems, as well as companies such
as Alteon, WebSystems, F5 Networks and Foundry Networks. Some of ArrowPoint's
competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and
greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, support and other resources than
ArrowPoint does.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS


     ArrowPoint's success and competitiveness depend significantly on the
protection of its proprietary technology. ArrowPoint relies primarily on a
combination of patents, copyrights, trade secret laws and restrictions on
disclosure to protect its proprietary technology. In December 1999 ArrowPoint
was awarded a U.S. patent covering a variety of claims relating to its content
switching technology, including a method for analyzing content to select the
most appropriate server to handle a particular request by a user. This patent
expires in August 2017. Despite these protections, others may be able to copy or
reverse engineer aspects of ArrowPoint's products, to obtain and use information
that it regards as proprietary or to independently develop similar technology.
In addition, ArrowPoint's patent has been issued only in the United States and
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect ArrowPoint's proprietary
rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.


     Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend ArrowPoint's
proprietary technology or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary
rights of others. This litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could
result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources.


     ArrowPoint attempts to avoid infringing intellectual property and
proprietary rights of third parties in its product development efforts. However,
ArrowPoint does not conduct patent searches to determine whether the technology
used in its products infringe patents held by third parties. In addition,
product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological
environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of
which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies. If
ArrowPoint's products violate third-party proprietary rights, it could be liable
for substantial damages. In addition, ArrowPoint may be required to reengineer
its products or seek to obtain licenses to continue offering those products, and
there can be no assurance that those efforts would be successful.



     ArrowPoint incorporates into its products some technology developed by
third parties, including the operating system for its Web switches and some
routing technology. ArrowPoint has purchased licenses to these technologies,
which generally have an indefinite term or renew automatically, and in some
cases have obtained rights to the source code for the licensed software.
ArrowPoint believes that alternative sources for these technologies are
available.


                                       72

     ArrowPoint has received trademark registrations in several foreign
jurisdictions for the mark "ArrowPoint," and it has applications pending in the
U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions for the trademarks "Content Smart,"
"Content Smart Switching," "Flowminder" and "Flowwall Security."


EMPLOYEES


     As of March 31, 2000, ArrowPoint had 337 employees. None of ArrowPoint's
employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. ArrowPoint believes
that its relations with its employees are good.


FACILITIES


     ArrowPoint's headquarters are located in approximately 45,000 square feet
of space in an office building in Acton, Massachusetts, under a lease that
expires in November 2004. ArrowPoint also leases sales offices in 23 locations
around the world. ArrowPoint believes that its existing facilities are adequate
to meet its current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will
be available on commercially reasonable terms when needed.


LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


     ArrowPoint was named a defendant in a civil suit filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York by Arrow Electronics, Inc.
on July 19, 1999. In the lawsuit, Arrow Electronics asserts trademark
infringement and associated state law claims. In particular, Arrow Electronics
alleges that customers are likely to be confused between Arrow Electronics and
ArrowPoint, and by use of the Internet domain name arrowpoint.com. Arrow
Electronics is seeking an injunction precluding ArrowPoint from using the name
and mark ArrowPoint and requiring it to relinquish registration of the domain
name arrowpoint.com. ArrowPoint has filed an answer denying all material
allegations asserted in the complaint. The case is presently in the early stages
of discovery. ArrowPoint intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit, including
its right to use the ArrowPoint trademark and the arrowpoint.com domain name.


     ArrowPoint is not currently a party to any other legal proceedings.

                      COMPARISON OF RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS
                            OF ARROWPOINT AND CISCO

     The following discussion of certain similarities and material differences
between the rights of Cisco shareholders and the rights of ArrowPoint
stockholders under the respective articles/certificate of incorporation and
bylaws is only a summary of certain provisions and does not purport to be a
complete description of the similarities and differences, and is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the California law and the Delaware law, the common
law thereunder and the full text of the articles/certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of each of Cisco and ArrowPoint.

     This section of the proxy statement/prospectus describes certain
differences between the rights of holders of ArrowPoint common stock and Cisco
common stock. While we believe that the description covers the material
differences between the two, this summary may not contain all of the information
that is important to you. You should carefully read this entire document and the
other documents we refer to for a more complete understanding of the differences
between being a stockholder of ArrowPoint and being a shareholder of Cisco. When
reading this description, please note that Delaware law refers to holders of
common stock as stockholders while California law uses the term shareholder. The
two terms mean the same thing in practice and for all practical purposes may be
used interchangeably; however, we generally have used the term "stockholder"
when referring to holders of ArrowPoint common stock or to Delaware law and
"shareholder" when referring to holders of Cisco common stock or to California
law.

     As a stockholder of ArrowPoint, your rights are governed by ArrowPoint's
amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as currently in effect, and
ArrowPoint's amended and restated bylaws. After completion of the merger, you
will become a shareholder of Cisco. As a Cisco shareholder, your rights will be
governed by Cisco's articles of incorporation and Cisco's bylaws. In addition,
Cisco is incorporated in California while ArrowPoint is incorporated in
Delaware. Although the rights and privileges of stockholders of a Delaware
corporation are in many instances comparable to those of shareholders of a
California corporation, there are also differences.

DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS AND STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS


     The ArrowPoint bylaws provide that its stockholders who are entitled to
vote for the election of directors may nominate directors for election at an
annual or special meeting or bring proposals at an annual or special meeting if
they provide ArrowPoint with written notice that complies with the time and
content requirements of the ArrowPoint bylaws and other regulatory requirements.
For notice of stockholder nominations to be timely, the notice must be received
by ArrowPoint's Secretary not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to
the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting; or in
the case of an election of directors at a special meeting, no later than the
16th day prior to such meeting and the 10th day following the day on which
notice of the date of such special meeting was mailed or public disclosure of
the date of such special meeting was made, whichever occurs first, and no
earlier than the 90th day prior to such special meeting. The ArrowPoint bylaws
provide that shareholders may propose business to be brought before a meeting of
shareholders only if they provide timely notice to ArrowPoint.


     The Cisco bylaws provide that shareholders may propose business to be
brought before a meeting of shareholders or nominate directors only if they
provide notice to Cisco no later than 60 days prior to such meeting.

AMENDMENT TO GOVERNING DOCUMENTS

     Delaware law requires a vote of the corporation's board of directors
followed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock of each
class entitled to vote for any amendment to the

                                       76
<PAGE>   83

certificate of incorporation, unless a greater level of approval is required by
the certificate of incorporation. Further, Delaware law states that if an
amendment would increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares
of such class, increase or decrease the par value of shares of such class or
alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of a particular class
or series of stock so as to affect them adversely, the class or series shall be
given the power to vote as a class notwithstanding the absence of any
specifically enumerated power in the certificate of incorporation. Delaware law
also states that the power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of a corporation
shall be vested in the stockholders entitled to vote, provided that the
corporation in its certificate of incorporation may confer such power on the
board of directors in addition to the stockholders.


     ArrowPoint's certificate of incorporation provides that the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote in any
annual election of directors, voting together as a single class, is required to
amend provisions of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws relating to:


     - stockholder action without a meeting;

     - the calling of special meetings;

     - the number, election, term and classes of directors;

     - the filling of vacancies;

     - the removal of directors;

     - the quorum and actions at meetings; and

     - stockholder nominations.


     ArrowPoint's certificate of incorporation further provides that
notwithstanding any other provision of law or its bylaws, only the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to cast a vote in
any annual election of the directors or class or directors may amend or repeal
provisions of its certificate of incorporation relating to:


     - the number, election and classes of directors;

     - the terms of director's office;

     - director quorums and action at meetings;

     - removal of directors;

     - stockholder action by written consent; and

     - special meeting of stockholders.

     Unless otherwise specified in a California corporation's articles of
incorporation, an amendment to the articles of incorporation requires the
approval of the corporation's board of directors and the affirmative vote of a
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, either before or
after the board approval, although certain minor amendments may be adopted by
the board alone such as amendments causing stock splits (including an increase
in the authorized number of shares in proportion thereto) and amendments
changing names and addresses given in the articles. The Cisco articles of
incorporation do not require a greater level of approval for an amendment
thereto. Under California law,

                                       77
<PAGE>   84

the holders of the outstanding shares of a class of stock are entitled to vote
as a class if a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation would:

     - increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of such
       class;

     - effect an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or part of
       the shares of such class, other than a stock split;

     - effect an exchange, or create a right of exchange, of all or part of the
       shares of another class into the shares of such class;

     - change the rights, preferences, privileges or restrictions of the shares
       of such class;

     - create a new class of shares having rights, preferences or privileges
       prior to the shares of such class, or increase the rights, preferences or
       privileges or the number of authorized shares having rights, preference
       or privileges prior to the shares of such class;

     - in the case of preferred shares, divide the shares of any class into
       series having different rights, preferences, privileges or restrictions
       or authorize the board of directors to do so; or

     - cancel or otherwise affect dividends on the shares of such class which
       have accrued but have not been paid.

     Under California law, a corporation's bylaws may be adopted, amended or
repealed either by the board of directors or the shareholders of the
corporation. The Cisco bylaws provide that the Cisco bylaws may be adopted,
amended or repealed either by the vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote or by the board of directors; provided,
however, that the Cisco board of directors may not amend the Cisco bylaws in
order to change the authorized number of directors (except to alter the
authorized number of directors within the existing range of a minimum of eight
and a maximum of 15 directors).

CUMULATIVE VOTING


     ArrowPoint's certificate of incorporation states that there shall be no
cumulative voting. Therefore, under Delaware law, cumulative voting rights are
not available to ArrowPoint stockholders. The Cisco articles provide for the
elimination of cumulative voting in elections of directors. Therefore, under
California law, cumulative voting rights are not available to Cisco
shareholders.


APPRAISAL RIGHTS

     Under Delaware law, holders of shares of any class or series, who neither
vote in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consent thereto in writing,
have the right, in certain circumstances, to dissent from a merger or
consolidation by demanding payment in cash for their shares equal to the fair
value (excluding any appreciation or depreciation as a consequence or in
expectation of the transaction) of such shares, as determined by agreement with
the corporation or by an independent appraiser appointed by a court in an action
timely brought by the corporation or the dissenters. Delaware law grants
dissenters' appraisal rights only in the case of mergers or consolidations and
not in the case of a sale or transfer of assets or a purchase of assets for
stock regardless of the number of shares being issued. Further, no appraisal
rights are available for shares of any class or series listed on a national
securities exchange or designated as a national market system security on the
Nasdaq National Market or held of record by more than 2,000 stockholders, unless
the agreement of merger or consolidation converts such shares into anything
other than stock of the surviving corporation; stock of another corporation
which is either listed on a national securities exchange or designated as a
national market system security on the Nasdaq National Market or held of record
by more than 2,000 stockholders; cash in lieu of fractional shares; or some
combination of

                                       78
<PAGE>   85

the above. In addition, dissenters' rights are not available for any shares of
the surviving corporation if the merger did not require the vote of the
stockholders of the surviving corporation. See "The Merger and Related
Transactions -- No Dissenters' or Appraisal Rights."

     Under California law, if the approval of the outstanding shares of the
corporation is required for a merger or reorganization, each shareholder
entitled to vote on the transaction, and who did not vote in favor of the
reorganization, may require the corporation to purchase for cash at their fair
market value the shares owned by such shareholder. No appraisal rights are
available for shares listed on any national securities exchange certified by the
Commissioner of Corporations or listed on the list of OTC margin stocks issued
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Systems, unless there exists
with respect to such shares any restriction on transfer imposed by the
corporation or by any law or regulation or if demands for payment are filed with
respect to 5% or more of the outstanding shares of that class.

DERIVATIVE ACTION

     Derivative actions may be brought in Delaware by a stockholder on behalf
of, and for the benefit of, the corporation. Delaware law provides that a
stockholder must aver in the complaint that he or she was a stockholder of the
corporation at the time of the transaction of which he or she complains. A
stockholder may not sue derivatively unless he first makes demand on the
corporation that it bring suit and such demand has been refused, unless it is
shown that such demand would have been futile.

     California law provides that a shareholder bringing a derivative action on
behalf of the corporation need not have been a shareholder at the time of the
transaction in question, provided that certain tests are met concerning the
fairness of allowing the action to go forward. The shareholder must make his or
her demands on the board before filing suit. The California law also provides
that the corporation or the defendant in a derivative suit may make a motion to
the court for an order requiring the plaintiff shareholder to furnish a security
bond.

STOCKHOLDER CONSENT IN LIEU OF MEETING

     Under Delaware law and California law, unless otherwise provided in the
certificate or articles of incorporation, any action required to be taken or
which may be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders may be taken
without a meeting if a consent in writing is signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having at least the minimum number of votes required to
authorize such action. If consent is sought for less than all shareholders
entitled to vote, notice as required under the California law shall be given.
The ArrowPoint certificate of incorporation and bylaws prohibit stockholder
action without a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders. The
Cisco articles of incorporation provide that directors may not be elected by
written consent except by unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to
vote for the election of directors.

FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF DIRECTORS

     Directors of corporations incorporated or organized under Delaware law and
California law have fiduciary obligations to the corporation and its
stockholders. Pursuant to these fiduciary obligations, the directors must act in
accordance with the so-called duties of "due care" and "loyalty." Under Delaware
law, the duty of care requires that the directors act in an informed and
deliberative manner and to inform themselves, prior to making a business
decision, of all material information reasonably available to them. The duty of
loyalty may be summarized as the duty to act in good faith, not out of
self-interest and in a manner that the directors reasonably believe to be in the
best interests of the corporation. Under California law, the duty of loyalty
requires directors to perform their duties in good faith in a manner that the
directors reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the corporation and
its

                                       79
<PAGE>   86

shareholders. The duty of care requires that the directors act with such care,
including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position
would exercise under similar circumstances.

INDEMNIFICATION

     Delaware law generally permits a corporation to indemnify its directors and
officers against expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred in connection with a third-party action, other
than a derivative action, and against expenses actually and reasonably incurred
in the defense or settlement of a derivative action, provided that there is a
determination that the individual acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation. Such
determination shall be made, in the case of an individual who is a director or
officer at the time of such determination:

     - by a majority of the disinterested directors, even though less than a
       quorum;

     - by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such
       directors, even though less than a quorum;

     - by independent legal counsel, regardless of whether a quorum of
       disinterested directors exists; or

     - by a majority vote of the stockholders, at a meeting at which a quorum is
       present.

     Delaware law requires indemnification of directors and officers for
expenses relating to a successful defense on the merits or otherwise of a
derivative or third-party action. Without court approval, however, no
indemnification may be made in respect of any derivative action in which such
individual is adjudged liable to the corporation.

     Delaware law does permit a corporation to advance expenses relating to the
defense of any proceeding to directors and officers contingent upon such
individuals' commitment to repay any advances unless it is determined ultimately
that such individuals are entitled to be indemnified. Under Delaware law, the
rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided in the law are
non-exclusive, in that, subject to public policy issues, indemnification and
advancement of expenses beyond that provided by statute may be provided by
bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders, disinterested directors or otherwise.

     The ArrowPoint certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the
corporation may eliminate the personal liability of the ArrowPoint officers and
directors for monetary damages resulting from breaches of their fiduciary duty
to the extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law and indemnify
the ArrowPoint directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Section
145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, including circumstances in which
indemnification is otherwise discretionary.

     Under California law, a corporation has the power to indemnify present and
former directors, officers, employees and agents against expenses, judgments,
fines, settlements and other amounts (other than in connection with actions by
or in the right of the corporation) if that person acted in good faith and in a
manner the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the
corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause
to believe the conduct of the person was unlawful, and a corporation has the
power to indemnify, with certain exceptions, any person who is a party to any
action by or in the right of the corporation, against expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by that person in connection with the defense or settlement
of the action if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person
believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders.

     The indemnification authorized by California law is not exclusive, and a
corporation may grant its directors, officers, employees or other agents certain
additional rights to indemnification. The Cisco

                                       80
<PAGE>   87

articles of incorporation and the Cisco bylaws provide for the indemnification
of its agents (as defined under the California law) to the fullest extent
permissible under California law, which may be in excess of the indemnification
expressly permitted by Section 317 of the California Corporations Code, subject
to the limits set forth in Section 204 of the California Corporations Code with
respect to actions for breach of duty to the corporation and its shareholders.

     California law also allows for the advance payment of an indemnitee's
expenses prior to the final disposition of an action, provided that the
indemnitee undertakes to repay any such amount advanced if it is later
determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification with regard to
the action for which the expenses were advanced.

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities under securities laws may be
permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling ArrowPoint, pursuant to
the foregoing provisions, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act of 1933 and is therefore unenforceable.

DIRECTOR LIABILITY

     Delaware law and California law each provide that the charter documents of
the corporation may include provisions which limit or eliminate the liability of
directors to the corporation or its stockholders, provided such liability does
not arise from certain proscribed conduct, including, in the case of Delaware
law, for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
stockholders acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law, the payment of unlawful dividends or
expenditure of funds for unlawful stock purchases or redemptions or transactions
from which such director derived an improper personal benefit, or, in the case
of California law, intentional misconduct or knowing and culpable violation of
law, acts or omissions that a director believes to be contrary to the best
interests of the corporation or its shareholders or that involve the absence of
good faith on the part of the director, the receipt of an improper personal
benefit, acts or omissions that show reckless disregard for the director's duty
to the corporation or its shareholders, where the director in the ordinary
course of performing a director's duties should be aware of a risk of serious
injury to the corporation or its shareholders, acts or omissions that constitute
an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the
director's duty to the corporation and its shareholders, interested transactions
between the corporation and a director in which a director has a material
financial interest and liability for improper distributions, loans or
guarantees. The ArrowPoint certificate of incorporation contains a provision
limiting the liability of its directors except as required by Delaware law. The
Cisco articles of incorporation contain a provision limiting the liability of
its directors to the fullest extent provided by California law.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS AND INTERESTED STOCKHOLDER TRANSACTIONS

     The ArrowPoint bylaws provide that a special meeting of the stockholders
may be called by the chairman of the board, the board of directors or the
president. The Cisco bylaws provide that in addition to the board of directors,
the chairman of the board and the president, one or more shareholders holding
not less than 10% of the voting power of the corporation may call a special
meeting of the shareholders.

     Delaware law prohibits, in certain circumstances, a "business combination"
between the corporation and an "interested stockholder" within three years of
the stockholder becoming an "interested stockholder." An "interested
stockholder" is a holder who, directly or indirectly, controls 15% or more of
the outstanding voting stock or is an affiliate of the corporation and was the
owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock at any time within the
prior three year period. A "business

                                       81
<PAGE>   88

combination" includes a merger or consolidation, a sale or other disposition of
assets having an aggregate market value equal to 10% or more of the consolidated
assets of the corporation or the aggregate market value of the outstanding stock
of the corporation and certain transactions that would increase the interested
stockholder's proportionate share ownership in the corporation. This provision
does not apply where:

     - either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the
       stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the
       corporation's board of directors prior to the date the interested
       stockholder acquired such 15% interest;

     - upon the consummation of the transaction which resulted in the
       stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested
       stockholder owned at least 85% of the outstanding voting stock of the
       corporation excluding for the purposes of determining the number of
       shares outstanding shares held by persons who are directors and also
       officers and by employee stock plans in which participants do not have
       the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the
       plan will be tendered;

     - the business combination is approved by a majority of the board of
       directors and the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the outstanding votes
       entitled to be cast by disinterested stockholders at an annual or special
       meeting;

     - the corporation does not have a class of voting stock that is listed on a
       national securities exchange, authorized for quotation on an inter-dealer
       quotation system of a registered national securities association, or held
       of record by more than 2,000 stockholders unless any of the foregoing
       results from action taken, directly or indirectly, by an interested
       stockholder or from a transaction in which a person becomes an interested
       stockholder;

     - the stockholder acquires a 15% interest inadvertently and divests itself
       of such ownership and would not have been a 15% stockholder in the
       preceding three years but for the inadvertent acquisition of ownership;

     - the stockholder acquired the 15% interest when these restrictions did not
       apply; or

     - the corporation has opted out of this provision.

     ArrowPoint has not opted out of this provision.

     Under California law, there is no comparable provision. However, California
law does provide that, except where the fairness of the terms and conditions of
the transaction has been approved by the California Commissioner of Corporations
and except in a "short-form" merger (the merger of a parent corporation with a
subsidiary in which the parent owns at least 90% of the outstanding shares of
each class of the subsidiary's stock), if the surviving corporation or its
parent corporation owns, directly or indirectly, shares of the target
corporation representing more than 50% of the voting power of the target
corporation prior to the merger, the nonredeemable common stock of a target
corporation may be converted only into nonredeemable common stock of the
surviving corporation or its parent corporation, unless all of the shareholders
of the class consent. The effect of this provision is to prohibit a cash-out
merger of minority shareholders, except where the majority shareholders already
own 90% or more of the voting power of the target corporation and could,
therefore, effect a short-form merger to accomplish such a cash-out of minority
shareholders.


ADVANCE NOTICE OF MEETING



     Delaware law requires that stockholders be provided prior written notice no
more than 60 days nor less than 10 days prior to a meeting of stockholders. The
board may fix a record date for determining the rights to vote at the meeting of
stockholders and such record date shall not be more than 60 days


                                       82
<PAGE>   89


nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. Delaware law further
states that stockholders be provided prior written notice no more than 60 days
prior to the record date to determine the stockholders entitled to receive
payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the
stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action.
Finally, Delaware law provides that due notice of the time, place and purpose of
the meeting to approve a merger agreement be mailed at least 20 days prior to
the date of the meeting.


     California law requires that shareholders be provided prior written notice
no more than 60 days nor less than 10 days prior to the record date for
determining the shareholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote or
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment
of any rights or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any other lawful
action.

INSPECTION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS

     Delaware and California law allow any stockholder to inspect the accounting
books and records and minutes of proceedings of the stockholders and the board
and to inspect the stockholders' list at any reasonable time during usual
business hours, for a purpose reasonably related to such holder's interests as a
stockholder. Additionally, California law provides for an absolute right to
inspect and copy the corporation's shareholders list by a shareholder or
shareholders holding at least 5% in the aggregate of the corporation's
outstanding voting shares, or any shareholder or shareholders holding 1% or more
of such shares who have filed a Schedule 14A with the Commission.

SIZE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Delaware law states that the board of directors shall consist of one or
more members with the number of directors to be fixed as provided in the bylaws
of the corporation, unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of
directors, in which case a change in the number of directors shall be made only
by amendment of the certificate. ArrowPoint's board of directors may consist of
such number of directors as determined by the board of directors, but in no
event shall it consist of less than three, and currently consists of five
directors. The number of directors on ArrowPoint's board of directors may be
decreased to eliminate vacancies existing by reason of death, resignation,
removal or expiration of the term of one or more directors, by a majority vote
of the ArrowPoint directors then in office.

     Under California law, as provided in the articles of incorporation or
bylaws, the number of directors may be specific or may be not less than a stated
minimum nor more than a stated maximum, with the exact number to be fixed by the
board or the shareholders. The minimum number cannot be less than three. A bylaw
changing or fixing a number of directors may only be adopted by approval of a
majority of the outstanding shares. The Cisco bylaws provide that the authorized
number of directors of the corporation shall be not less than eight nor more
than 15, the exact number of directors to be fixed from time to time within such
range by duly adopted resolutions of the board of directors or shareholders.

REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     Delaware law states that any director or the entire board of directors may
be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares
then entitled to vote at an election of directors. ArrowPoint's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws provide that ArrowPoint directors may be removed only
for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of ArrowPoint entitled to vote generally
in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

                                       83
<PAGE>   90

     California law provides that the board of directors may declare vacant the
office of a director who has been declared of unsound mind by an order of court
or convicted of a felony. Further, any director or the entire board of directors
may be removed, with or without cause, with the approval of a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon; however, no director may be removed
(unless the entire board is removed) if the number of shares voted against the
removal would be sufficient to elect the director under cumulative voting.
Shareholders holding at least 10% of the outstanding shares in any class may sue
in superior county court to remove from office any officer or director for
fraud, dishonest acts or gross abuse of authority or discretion.

TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING DIRECTORS

     Both Delaware law and California law state that any contract or transaction
between a corporation and any of its directors, or a second corporation in which
a director has a material financial interest is not void or voidable if the
material facts as to the transaction and as to the director's interest are fully
disclosed and a majority of the disinterested shareholders represented and
voting at a duly held meeting approve or ratify the transaction in good faith.
California law provides that such a contract or transaction also is not void or
voidable if either after full disclosure the transaction is approved by the
board or a committee (excluding the vote of interested directors) in good faith
and the transaction is just and reasonable to the corporation, or the person
asserting the validity of the contract or transaction sustains the burden of
proving that the contract or transaction was just and reasonable as to the
corporation at the time it was authorized, approved or ratified. Delaware law is
similar except that, there is no need for the transaction to be shown to be just
and reasonable and, the transaction must be shown to be fair instead of just and
reasonable.

FILLING VACANCIES ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     Delaware law provides that, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, vacancies may be filled by a majority of the directors
then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
Further, if, at the time of filling any vacancy, the directors then in office
shall constitute less than a majority of the whole board, the Court of Chancery
may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of
the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote
for such directors, summarily order any election to be held to fill any such
vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by
the directors then in office.

     ArrowPoint's bylaws provide that vacancies may be filled by a majority of
the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole
remaining director. Any director elected by the board of directors to fill a
vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold the office for the remainder of
the full term of the class of directors in which such directorship is part, and
until such director's successor is elected and deemed qualified.

     Under California law, any vacancy on the board of directors other than one
created by removal of a director may be filled by the board of directors, unless
otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws. If the number of directors is less
than a quorum, a vacancy may be filled by the unanimous written consent of the
directors then in office, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors
at a meeting held pursuant to notice or waivers of notice or by a sole remaining
director. A vacancy created by removal of director can only be filled by the
shareholders unless board approval is authorized by a corporation's articles of
incorporation or by a bylaw approved by the corporation's shareholders. The
Cisco bylaws authorize the board to fill a vacancy created by the removal of a
director.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
ArrowPoint Communications, Inc.:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ArrowPoint
Communications, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiary as of December 31,
1998 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations, redeemable
convertible preferred stock and stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows
for the period from inception (April 14, 1997) to December 31, 1997, and for the
years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of ArrowPoint Communications,
Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the period from inception (April 14, 1997)
to December 31, 1997, and for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     ArrowPoint Communications, Inc. (the Company or ArrowPoint) was
incorporated as a Delaware corporation on April 14, 1997 and provides
intelligent Web switches that enable customers to deploy a global Web network
architecture to optimize e-commerce transactions and the delivery of Web
content. The Company's products, which are specifically designed for the Web,
are intended to enhance the performance, scalability, availability, reliability
and security of customers' Web sites.

     The Company incurred net losses of $2,856,097, $9,446,980, and $12,605,966
for the period from inception (April 14, 1997) to December 31, 1997 and for the
years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively. At December 31, 1999, the
Company had an accumulated deficit of $25,013,556. During 1998, ArrowPoint
commenced commercial shipment of its products and emerged from the development
stage. Although no longer in the development stage, ArrowPoint continues to be
subject to the risks and challenges similar to other companies in a similar
stage of development. These risks include, but are not limited to, dependence on
key individuals, dependence on a single contract manufacturer and key suppliers
of integral components, successful development and marketing of products, the
ability to obtain adequate financing to support growth and competition from
substitute products and larger companies with greater financial, technical,
management and marketing resources.

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application
of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and
elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements.

                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(a) INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The interim consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2000 and for
the three months ended March 31, 1999 and 2000 included herein have been
prepared by ArrowPoint Communications, Inc. (the Company or ArrowPoint), without
audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and
regulations. ArrowPoint believes the disclosures included in the unaudited
consolidated financial statements, when read in conjunction with the Company's
December 31, 1999 consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

     The unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein reflect all
adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair
presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of
the dates and for the periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal,
recurring nature. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31,
2000 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
future quarters or the year ending December 31, 2000.

(b) USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(c) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

(d) REVENUE RECOGNITION

     The Company recognizes revenue from product sales to end users, resellers
and OEMs upon product shipment, provided that there are no uncertainties
regarding acceptance, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales
price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is
probable. If uncertainties exist, the Company recognizes revenue when those
uncertainties are resolved. The Company's distributors have certain limited
rights of return and therefore, the Company recognizes revenue on product sales
to distributors when the rights of return lapse, provided that there are no
uncertainties regarding acceptance, there is persuasive evidence of an
arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the
related receivable is probable. If uncertainties exist, the Company recognizes
revenue when those uncertainties are resolved. In multiple element arrangements
that contain product and service elements, the Company uses the residual method
when fair value does not exist for one of the delivered elements in the
arrangement. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
elements is deferred and subsequently recognized. The Company has established
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for support services.

                                       F-8

                        ARROWPOINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
                                AND SUBSIDIARIES

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Accordingly, product revenue is recognized under the residual method in
arrangements in which the product is sold with support services. Service revenue
is recognized as the services are performed or ratably over the terms of the
service contracts. Amounts collected or billed prior to satisfying the above
revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue.

     Warranty costs are estimated and recorded by the Company at the time of
product revenue recognition.

(e) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents.

(f) CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 105, Disclosure of
Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and
Financial Instruments with Concentrations of Credit Risk, requires disclosure of
any significant off-balance-sheet and credit risk concentrations. The Company
has no significant off-balance-sheet concentrations such as foreign exchange
contracts, option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. The Company
maintains the majority of its cash and cash equivalent balances with one
financial institution. One customer represented approximately 11% of total
accounts receivable at December 31, 1999. In 1998, three customers accounted for
57%, 22% and 16% of revenue, respectively. In 1999, one customer accounted for
14% of revenue.

(g) SINGLE SOURCE SUPPLIERS AND SINGLE CONTRACT MANUFACTURER

     Several key components of the Company's products are currently available
from single vendors. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient quantities of
these components, it would be unable to manufacture and ship its products on a
timely basis. This could result in lost or delayed revenue, damage to the
Company's reputation and increased manufacturing costs.

     The Company currently subcontracts the manufacturing and testing of its
products to an independent manufacturer. The Company's reliance on a single
manufacturer exposes it to a number of risks, including reduced control over
manufacturing capacity, product completion and delivery times, product quality,
and manufacturing costs. If the Company experiences increased demand for its
products, the challenges it faces in managing its relationship with the
independent manufacturer will be increased. If the independent manufacturer is
unable or unwilling to manufacture a sufficient quantity of products on the time
schedules and with the quality that the Company demands, the Company may be
forced to engage additional or replacement manufacturers, which could result in
additional expenses and delays in product shipments.

(j) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

     The costs of the development of hardware products and enhancements to
existing hardware products are expensed as incurred. The Company accounts for
its software development costs in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed.
Accordingly, the costs for the development of new software that are included in
the hardware products and substantial enhancements to such existing software are
expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at
which time any additional costs would be capitalized. The Company determines
technological feasibility has been established at the time at which a working
model of the software has been completed. Because the Company believes its
current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently
with the establishment of technological feasibility, no costs have been
capitalized to date.

(k) NET LOSS PER SHARE

     Basic and diluted net loss per share are presented in conformity with SFAS
No. 128, Earnings Per Share for all periods presented. In accordance with SFAS
No. 128, basic and diluted net loss per common share was determined by dividing
net loss available for common stockholders by the weighted average common shares
outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. Basic and
diluted net loss per share are the same because all outstanding common stock
options have been excluded as they are considered antidilutive since the Company
has incurred a net loss for all periods presented. Options to purchase a total
of 966,000 and 3,805,070 common shares have been excluded from the computations
of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the years ended December 31,

1998 and 1999, respectively. Shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion
of outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock have also been excluded for
all periods presented.

     In accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98, Earnings Per
Share in an Initial Public Offering, the Company has determined that there were
no nominal issuances of the Company's common stock prior to the Company's
proposed initial public offering.

     The Company's historical capital structure is not indicative of its capital
structure after the initial public offering due to the automatic conversion of
all shares of preferred stock into common stock concurrent with the closing of
the Company's initial public offering on April 5, 2000. Accordingly, pro forma
net loss per share is presented for the year ended December 31, 1999 and the
three months ended March 31, 1999 and 2000. assuming the conversion of all
outstanding shares of preferred stock into common stock using the if-converted
method from the respective dates of issuance.

outstanding to the shares used in the computation of pro forma basic and diluted
net loss per share:

(4) INCOME TAXES

     The Company accounts for federal and state income taxes in accordance with
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently
enacted tax rates.

     No provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded, as the
Company has incurred net operating losses for all periods presented. As of
December 31, 1999, the Company had net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $20,594,000 and $1,097,000, respectively,
available to reduce future federal and state income taxes, if any. If not
utilized, these carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2019. If
substantial changes in the Company's ownership were to occur, as defined by
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, there could be annual limitations on
the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized in future periods.

     The approximate income tax effects of each type of temporary differences
and carryforwards are as follows:

     As of December 31,1999, the Company has an equipment line-of-credit
agreement (the Equipment Line) and an accounts receivable line-of-credit
agreement (the Accounts Receivable Line) with a bank.

(a) EQUIPMENT LINE

     This agreement provides for three separate loan commitments consisting of
(i) a Tranche A commitment of up to $2 million, (ii) a Tranche B commitment of
up to $2 million less the amount

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

outstanding on Tranche A and (iii) a Tranche C commitment of up to $2 million
less the amounts outstanding under Tranche A and B. Advances totaling $676,190
were outstanding under Tranche A at December 31, 1998 and converted to a term
loan payable in 36 equal installments commencing on February 1, 1999. Amounts
outstanding under this term loan at December 31, 1999 were $469,577. Advances
totaling $80,947 under Tranche B converted to a term loan payable in 36 equal
installments commencing on July 1, 1999. Amounts outstanding under this term
loan at December 31, 1999 were $69,704. Advances totaling $607,583 were
outstanding under Tranche C at December 31, 1999 and will convert to a term loan
payable in 36 equal installments commencing on October 1, 2000.

     Amounts due under the Equipment Line are collateralized by the assets
purchased under the Equipment Line. All outstanding amounts bear interest at the
prime rate (8.50% at December 31, 1999) plus 0.5%.

(b) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE LINE

     Borrowings under the Accounts Receivable Line are limited to the lesser of
$5 million or an amount based on eligible trade accounts receivable. The
maturity date of this agreement is June 30, 2000. All outstanding amounts under
the Accounts Receivable Line bear interest at the prime rate (8.50% at December
31, 1999). At December 31, 1999, there were no amounts outstanding under the
Accounts Receivable Line. In addition, the Company is required to comply with
certain financial and restrictive covenants.

     Pursuant to the line of credit agreements, the Company is required to
comply with financial and restrictive covenants related to, among other things,
minimum liquidity, maximum leverage, profitability and net worth. As of December
31, 1999, the Company was out of compliance with one of these covenants. The
bank waived the Company's non-compliance with this covenant for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The waiver does not apply to periods after December 31, 1999.
In March 2000 the equipment line borrowings were repaid and at March 31, 2000
there were no borrowings under the equipment or accounts receivable lines of
credit. Accordingly, amounts outstanding under the lines of credit have been
classified as short-term at December 31, 1999.

(6) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

(b) LITIGATION

     The Company was named a defendant in a civil suit filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Arrow
Electronics, Inc. on July 19, 1999. In the lawsuit, Arrow Electronics asserts
trademark infringement and associated state law claims. In particular, Arrow
Electronics alleges that customers are likely to be confused between Arrow
Electronics and ArrowPoint, and by use of the Internet domain name
arrowpoint.com. Arrow Electronics is seeking an injunction precluding the
Company from using the name ArrowPoint and requiring the Company to relinquish
registration of the domain name arrowpoint.com. The Company has filed an answer
denying all material allegations asserted in the complaint. The case is
presently in the early stages of discovery. The Company intends to vigorously
defend this lawsuit, including its right to use the ArrowPoint trademark and the
arrowpoint.com domain name. Arrow Electronics is not seeking the recovery of
monetary damages from the Company. Although the Company is unable to estimate
the costs associated with changing its corporate name, the Company believes that
an adverse outcome in this suit would not have a material impact on its
financial condition or results of operations.

     The Company is not currently a party to any other legal proceedings.

(d) 1997 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

     In April 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Stock
Incentive Plan (the Plan), which provides for the granting of incentive stock
options (ISOs), nonqualified stock options and the sale of common stock to
employees, officers, directors, advisors and consultants of the Company.

(i) COMMON STOCK

     Under the Plan, the Board of Directors may authorize the sale of common
stock to employees, officers, directors, advisors and consultants of the
Company. The purchase price for the common stock shall be determined by the
Board of Directors. In addition, for each grant, the Board of Directors will
determine the terms under which the Company may repurchase such shares.

     During 1997 and 1998, the Company sold 1,258,000 and 791,000 shares of
common stock, respectively, to various employees. These shares of common stock
were sold at fair market value and are subject to repurchase agreements which
provide for the vesting of these shares generally over five years. In 1999, the
Company sold 1,211,600 shares of common stock to various employees, subject to
repurchase agreements which provide for the vesting of these shares generally
over five years. In connection with the 1999 sales of common stock, the Company
recorded deferred compensation of approximately $5.7 million which represents
the aggregate difference between the deemed fair value and the selling price of
the common stock (See (iii) Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation). During
1998 and 1999, the Company repurchased 224,334 shares of common stock from
terminated employees. As of December 31, 1999, 2,400,944 shares of common stock
sold to employees under the Plan are subject to repurchase.

(ii) STOCK OPTIONS

     Under the Plan, the Board of Directors may grant ISOs and nonqualified
stock options to employees, officers, directors, advisors and consultants of the
Company. ISOs may be granted only to employees. The exercise price of each
option shall be determined by the Board of Directors, but it shall not be less
than the estimated fair market value on the date of grant. Nonqualified stock
options may be granted to employees, officers, directors, advisors or
consultants of the Company. The exercise price of each nonqualified stock option
shall be determined by the Board of Directors, but it shall not be less than the
par value of the common stock on the date of grant. All stock options granted
under the Plan expire within 10 years from the date of grant.

     During the period from January 1, 2000 to February 29, 2000, the Company
granted options to purchase 2,121,300 shares of common stock at an average
exercise price of $11.43 and options to purchase 87,372 shares of common stock
were exercised at an average exercise price of $0.34. During the period from
February 29, 2000 to March 27, 2000, the Company granted options to purchase
1,338,100 shares of common stock at an average exercise price of $25.36.

(iii) ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

     In 1999, the Company recorded deferred compensation of approximately $17.6
million. This amount represents the aggregate difference between the deemed fair
value of the Company's stock and the exercise price of stock options granted and
the selling price of stock sold. The Company expects to record additional
deferred compensation of approximately $8.8 million in the quarter ending March
31, 2000. All stock options granted and stock sold prior to 1999 were at fair
market value and therefore, did not result in deferred compensation. The
deferred compensation will be recognized as an expense over the vesting period
of the stock and stock options. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the
Company recorded approximately $2.3 million of compensation expense. The Company
expects to recognize compensation expense of approximately $11.1 million, $6.3
million, $3.8 million, $2.1 million, $704,000 and $6,000 during the years ended
December 31, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which requires the measurement of
the fair value of employee stock options or warrants to be included in the
statement of income or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The
Company has determined that it will account for stock-based compensation for
employees and directors under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25
and elect the disclosure-only alternative under SFAS No. 123, which requires
disclosure of the pro forma effects on earnings as if the fair-value-based
method of accounting under SFAS No. 123 had been adopted, as well as certain
other information. The Company has computed the pro forma disclosures required
under SFAS No. 123 for options granted in 1998 and 1999 using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model prescribed by SFAS No. 123. The assumptions used for grants
during the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999 include the following:

     If compensation cost had been determined for stock options granted to

accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company's net loss and net
loss per share for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999 would have
increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

     The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option pricing models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility. Because
ArrowPoint's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different
from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

(8) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

     In July 1997, the Company adopted a 401(k) retirement plan (the 401(k)
Plan) for eligible employees, as defined. Each participant may elect to
contribute up to 15% of his or her compensation for the plan year, subject to
certain IRS limitations. Company matching contributions are made to the 401(k)
Plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors. There have been no
discretionary contributions made by the Company to the 401(k) Plan to date.

(9) SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

     The Company has adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, which establishes standards for reporting
information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and
requires selected information for those segments to be presented in interim
financial reports issued to stockholders. SFAS No. 131 also establishes
standards for related disclosures about products and services and geographic
areas. To date, the Company has viewed its operations and manages its business
as principally one segment. As a result, the financial information disclosed
herein represents all of the material financial information related to the
Company's principal operating segment.

     The following table represents the percentage of revenue derived from

(10) SERIES E CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

     In January 2000, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to
authorize 699,837 shares of Series E convertible preferred stock (Series E
Preferred Stock). Also, in January 2000, the Company sold 657,263 shares of
Series E Preferred Stock at $21.14 per share for net proceeds to the Company of
$13,871,000. All shares of Series E Preferred Stock were automatically converted
into 1,314,526 shares of the Company's common stock upon the closing of the
Company's initial public offering. In connection with the sale of Series E
Preferred Stock, the Company recorded a charge to accumulated deficit of
$6,480,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2000. This amount represents the fair
value of the beneficial conversion feature of Series E Preferred Stock. This
amount has been accounted for like a dividend to preferred stockholders and, as
a result, increased the Company's net loss available to common stockholders and
the related net loss per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2000.

(11) INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (UNAUDITED)

     On April 5, 2000, ArrowPoint completed the sale of 5,750,000 shares of
common stock (including the exercise of the over-allotment option of 750,000
shares) in an underwritten initial public offering at a price of $34.00 per
share. Cash proceeds from the offering, net of underwriters' discount and
offering expenses, totaled approximately $180,400,000. Upon the closing of the
initial public offering, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock
(consisting of 5,750,000 shares), Series B Preferred Stock (consisting of
2,213,828 shares), Series C Preferred Stock (consisting of 278,464 shares),

                AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

     This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is
made and entered into as of May 4, 2000, by and among Cisco Systems, Inc., a
California corporation ("Parent"), Archer Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Merger Sub") and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Arrowpoint
Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company").

                                   RECITALS:

     A. The Boards of Directors of Company, Parent and Merger Sub believe it is
in the best interests of their respective companies and the stockholders of
their respective companies that Company and Merger Sub combine into a single
company through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the
"Merger") and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger.

     B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, $0.001 par value ("Company Common Stock"), shall be
converted into shares of Parent Common Stock, $0.001 par value ("Parent Common
Stock"), at the rate set forth herein.

     C. Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations
and warranties and other agreements in connection with the Merger.

     D. The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of
the Code and as a pooling of interests for financial accounting purposes.

     E. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as an inducement
to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, (a) Company and Parent
have entered into a stock option agreement dated the date hereof in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Option Agreement") providing for the purchase
by Parent of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock, and (b) certain
stockholders of Company have on the date hereof entered into a stockholder
agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Stockholder Agreement")
to vote the shares of Company Common Stock owned by such persons to approve the
Merger.

                                   AGREEMENT:

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set
forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Delaware Law"),
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation. Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is

the parties and set forth in the Certificate of Merger, being the "Effective
Time").

     1.3  Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the

     (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until

     1.6  Effect on Capital Stock. By virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the following
securities:

          (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, subject
     to Section 1.6(f), each share of Company Common Stock issued and
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares
     of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b)) will be
     canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically into the right to
     receive 2.1218 shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio").

          (b) Cancellation of Company Common Stock Owned by Parent or
     Company. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are
     owned by Company as treasury stock and each share of Company Common Stock
     owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent

<PAGE>   124

     obligations of Company under the Company ESPPs (as defined below) shall be
     assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.9.

          (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of
     common stock, $0.001 par value, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock")
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
     converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
     nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and the
     Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Each
     stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares
     shall continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
     Surviving Corporation.

          (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be
     adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split,
     stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
     convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
     reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
     Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof
     and prior to the Effective Time and of any increase in the number of shares
     of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
     shares of Company Common Stock, outstanding after the date hereof (treating
     as outstanding as of the date hereof, up to 7,033,695 shares of Company
     Common Stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options, options to
     purchase up to 148,441 shares of Company Common Stock to the extent granted
     pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and up to 42,000 shares of Company Common Stock
     issued pursuant to the Company ESPPs (as defined below)) relative to such
     number as derived from Section 2.2 hereof, so as to provide holders of
     Company Common Stock and Parent the same economic effect as contemplated by
     this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse split, stock dividend,
     reorganization, recapitalization, like change or increase.

          (f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
     will be issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common
     Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
     Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
     Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of
     cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
     fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of a share of Parent
     Common Stock as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market for the ten (10)
     trading days ending on the last full trading day prior to the Effective
     Time.

     1.7 Surrender of Certificates.

     (a) Exchange Agent. Parent's transfer agent shall act as exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

     (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock and Cash. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this Article I, through such reasonable procedures as Parent may
adopt, (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a)
in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (provided that delivery of any shares that are subject to
vesting and/or repurchase rights in favor of Company shall be in book entry form
until such vesting and/or repurchase rights lapse) and (ii) cash in an amount
sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 1.6(f).

     (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, whose shares were
converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in
lieu

                                       A-3
<PAGE>   125

of fractional shares) pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the Certificates by the
Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates (or book entries in
the case of shares that are subject to vesting and/or repurchase rights in favor
of Company) representing shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall
be sent, as promptly as practicable, in exchange therefor a certificate (or book
entry in the case of shares that are subject to vesting and/or repurchase
rights) representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.6, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the
Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the payment
of dividends, to evidence the ownership of the number of full shares of Parent
Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so
converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of
any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article I.

     (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the
holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject
to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time
of such surrender, the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable (but for the
provisions of this Section 1.7(d)) with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock.

     (e) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of
Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

     (f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any party
hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     1.8  Termination of Exchange Agent Funding. Any portion of funds (including
any interest earned thereon) or certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock
held by the Exchange Agent which have not been delivered to holders of
Certificates pursuant to this Article I within six months after the Effective
Time shall promptly be paid or delivered, as appropriate, to Parent, and
thereafter holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with the
exchange procedures set forth in and contemplated by

                                       A-4
<PAGE>   126

Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and similar laws) for their claim for shares of Parent Common Stock and,
only as general creditors thereof, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions (with a record date after
the Effective Time) with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are
entitled.

     1.9  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in
lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

     1.10  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock
(and cash in lieu of fractional shares) as may be required pursuant to Section
1.6; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

     1.11  Tax and Accounting Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto
that the Merger shall (a) constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and (b) qualify for accounting treatment as a pooling
of interests.

     1.12  Withholding Rights. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and from any other payments made
pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as Parent and the Surviving Corporation
are required to deduct and withhold with respect to such delivery and payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to
the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

     1.13  Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Company
and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations
or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so
long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE II

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

     In this Agreement, any reference to any event, change, condition or effect
being "material" with respect to any person means any material event, change,
condition or effect related to the condition (financial or otherwise),
properties, assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, business,
operations or results of operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. In this Agreement, any

                                       A-5
<PAGE>   127

reference to a "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to any person means any
event, change or effect that is materially adverse to the condition (financial
or otherwise), properties, assets, liabilities, business, operations or results
of operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, provided,
however, that a "Material Adverse Effect" (a) with respect to Parent or Company
shall not include a decrease, in and of itself, in the trading price of Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, and (b) with respect to Company shall not
include the following (collectively, "Non-Controllable Events"): (i) general
changes in the networking and telecommunications industry or economic conditions
that affect Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, substantially
proportionately relative to Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or
(ii) a decline in the revenues or earnings of Company following the date of this
Agreement which is attributable to a delay of, reduction in or cancellation or
change in the purchase orders by customers of Company arising as a result of the
execution or announcement of this Agreement (provided that revenues do not
decline below the amounts set forth in Schedule 2.0 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2000 and September 30, 2000, in
each case as of the end of such quarter). A decline of revenues below such
levels shall be deemed to be a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

     In this Agreement, any reference to a party's "knowledge" means such
party's actual knowledge after reasonable inquiry of officers, directors and
other employees of such party charged with senior administrative or operational
responsibility for such matters.

     Except as disclosed in that section of the document of even date herewith
delivered by Company to Parent prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") corresponding to the Section of
this Agreement to which any of the following representations and warranties
specifically relate or as disclosed in another section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule if it is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure that it is
applicable to another Section of this Agreement, Company represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

     2.1  Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Company and its subsidiaries
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of Company and its subsidiaries
has the corporate power to own its properties and to carry on its business as
now being conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted and is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company. Company has delivered to Parent a true and correct
copy of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the
"Certificate of Incorporation"), and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended, or
other charter documents, as applicable, of Company and each of its subsidiaries,
each as amended to date. Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in
violation of any of the provisions of its respective charter or bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents. Company is the owner of all outstanding
shares of capital stock of each of its subsidiaries and all such shares are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of each such subsidiary are owned by Company free and
clear of all liens, charges, claims or encumbrances or rights of others. There
are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights,
exchangeable or convertible securities or other commitments or agreements of any
character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities
of any such subsidiary, or otherwise obligating Company or any such subsidiary
to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
securities. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (as defined in
Section 2.4), Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any
equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or
other business association or entity.

     2.2  Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of Company consists of
200,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value, and 5,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value, of which there were issued and outstanding as
of the close of business on April 30, 2000, 35,045,467 shares of Common Stock
and no shares of Preferred Stock. There are no other outstanding shares of
capital stock or voting securities and no outstanding commitments to issue any
shares of capital stock or voting securities after April 30, 2000, other than
pursuant to the Option Agreement, the exercise of options outstanding as of such
date under the Company Stock Option Plans or pursuant to the Company's 2000
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 2000 International Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (together, the "Company ESPPs"). All outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are
free of any liens or encumbrances other than any liens or encumbrances created
by or imposed upon the holders thereof, and are not subject to preemptive rights
or rights of first refusal created by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws of Company or any agreement to which Company is a party or by which it
is bound. As of the close of business on April 30, 2000, Company has reserved
(i) 19,300,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance to employees, consultants and
directors pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans, of which 3,036,266 shares
have been issued pursuant to option exercises or direct stock purchases,
7,033,695 shares are subject to outstanding, unexercised options, no shares are
subject to outstanding stock purchase rights, and 9,177,539 shares are available
for issuance thereunder and (ii) 400,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance to
employees pursuant to the Company ESPPs, of which no shares have been issued.
Between April 30, 2000 and the date hereof, Company has not (i) issued or
granted additional options under the Company Stock Option Plans, or (ii)
accepted enrollments in the Company ESPPs. Except for (i) the rights created
pursuant to this Agreement, the Option Agreement, the Company Stock Option
Plans, and the Company ESPPs and (ii) Company's rights to repurchase any
unvested shares under the Company Stock Option Plans or restricted stock awards
granted outside of such Plans, there are no other options, warrants, calls,
rights, commitments or agreements of any character to which Company is a party
or by which it is bound obligating Company to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase
or redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any
shares of capital stock of Company or obligating Company to grant, extend,
accelerate the vesting of, change the price of, or otherwise amend or enter into
any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or agreement. There are no
contracts, commitments or agreements relating to voting, purchase or sale of
Company's capital stock (other than those that have been fully performed, those
granting Company the right to purchase unvested shares upon employment or
service termination, the Option Agreement and the Stockholder Agreement) (i)
between or among Company and any of its stockholders and (ii) to the best of
Company's knowledge, between or among any of Company's stockholders. The terms
of the Company Stock Option Plans permit the assumption or substitution of
options to purchase Parent Common Stock as provided in this Agreement, without
the consent or approval of the holders of such securities, stockholders, or
otherwise. The current "Purchase Period" (as defined in the Company ESPPs)
commenced under the Company ESPPs on May 1, 2000 and will end on October 31,
2000, and except for the purchase rights granted on such commencement date to
participants in the current Purchase Period, there are no other purchase rights
or options outstanding under the Company ESPPs. True and complete copies of all
agreements and instruments relating to or issued under the Company Stock Option
Plans or Company ESPPs have been made available to Parent and such agreements
and instruments have not been amended, modified or supplemented since being made
available to Parent, and there are no agreements to amend, modify or supplement
such agreements or instruments in any case from the form made available to
Parent. The shares of Company Common Stock issued under the Company Stock Option
Plans, as amended and under all prior versions thereof, have either been
registered under the Securities Act or were issued in transactions which
qualified for exemptions under either Section 4(2) of, or Rule 701 under, the
Securities Act for stock issuances under compensatory benefit plans.

     2.3  Authority. Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and the Option Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Option Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary

Agreement by Company's stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares

Agreement and the Option Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Company and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Company enforceable

of this Agreement and the Option Agreement by Company does not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or loss of any benefit under (i) any provision of
the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Company or any of its
subsidiaries, as amended, or (ii) any material mortgage, indenture, lease,
contract or other agreement or instrument, permit, concession, franchise,
license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties or
assets. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any court, administrative agency or commission or
other governmental authority or instrumentality ("Governmental Entity") is
required by or with respect to Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Option Agreement, or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for (i)
the filing of the Certificate of Merger as provided in Section 1.2; (ii) the
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the National

1933, as amended; (vi) the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC;
and (vii) such other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals and
registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Company and would not prevent, or materially alter or delay any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreement.

     2.4  SEC Documents; Financial Statements. Company has made available to
Parent a true and complete copy of each statement, report, registration
statement (with the prospectus in the form filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")), definitive proxy
statement and other filings made with the SEC by Company since March 31, 1999
and, prior to the Effective Time, Company will have furnished to Parent true and
complete copies of any additional documents filed with the SEC by Company prior
to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). Company has
timely filed all forms, statements and documents required to be filed by it with

Company has made available to Parent all exhibits to the Company SEC Documents
filed prior to the date hereof, and will promptly make available to Parent all

Time. All documents required to be filed as exhibits to the Company SEC
Documents have been so filed, and all material contracts so filed as exhibits
are in full force and effect, except those which have expired in accordance with
their terms, and neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in material
default thereunder. As of their respective filing dates, the Company SEC
Documents complied

                                       A-8
<PAGE>   130

in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the Securities Act, and none of the
Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected by a subsequently
filed Company SEC Document. The financial statements of Company, including the
notes thereto, included in the Company SEC Documents (the "Company Financial
Statements") were complete and correct in all material respects as of their
respective dates, complied as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto as of their respective dates, and have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
applied on a basis consistent throughout the periods indicated and consistent
with each other (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case
of unaudited statements included in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as permitted
by Form 10-Q of the SEC). The Company Financial Statements fairly present the
consolidated financial condition and operating results of Company and its
subsidiaries at the dates and during the periods indicated therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring year-end adjustments).
There has been no change in Company accounting policies since December 31, 1999.

Sheet Date"), Company has conducted its business in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice and there has not occurred: (i) any change, event
or condition (whether or not covered by insurance) that has resulted in, or
might reasonably be expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect to Company;
(ii) any acquisition, sale or transfer of any material asset of Company or any
of its subsidiaries other than in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with past practice; (iii) any change in accounting methods or practices
(including any change in depreciation or amortization policies or rates) by
Company or any revaluation by Company of any of its or any of its subsidiaries'
assets; (iv) any declaration, setting aside, or payment of a dividend or other
distribution with respect to the shares of Company, or any direct or indirect
redemption, purchase or other acquisition by Company of any of its shares of
capital stock; (v) any material contract entered into by Company or any of its
subsidiaries, other than in the ordinary course of business and as provided to
Parent, or any material amendment or termination of, or default under, any
material contract to which Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by
which it is bound; (vi) any amendment or change to the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws; or (vii) any increase in or modification of the
compensation or benefits payable, or to become payable, by Company to any of its
directors or employees, other than pursuant to scheduled annual performance
reviews, provided that any resulting modifications are in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with Company's past practices. Company has not agreed
since March 31, 2000 to do any of the things described in the preceding clauses
(i) through (vii) and is not currently involved in any negotiations to do any of
the things described in the preceding clauses (i) through (vii) (other than

or tribunal, foreign or domestic, or, to the knowledge of Company or any of its

their respective properties or any of their respective officers or directors (in
their capacities as such) that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. There is no
judgment, decree or order against Company or any of its subsidiaries, or, to the
knowledge of Company and its subsidiaries, any of their respective directors or
officers (in their capacities as such), that could prevent, enjoin, alter or

     2.8  Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no agreement, judgment,
injunction, order or decree binding upon Company or any of its subsidiaries
which has or reasonably could be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or
materially impairing any current business practice of Company or any of its

subsidiaries or the conduct by Company or any of its subsidiaries of its
business as currently conducted or as currently contemplated to be conducted.

     2.9  Governmental Authorization. Company and each of its subsidiaries have
obtained each federal, state, county, local or foreign governmental consent,

interest ((i) and (ii) herein collectively called "Company Authorizations"), and
all of such Company Authorizations are in full force and effect, except where
the failure to obtain or have any of such Company Authorizations could not

title to all of their respective properties, interests in properties and assets,

combined, unitary or aggregate group for Tax (as defined below) purposes of
which Company or any of its subsidiaries is or has been a member, have properly
completed and timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by them and have
paid all Taxes shown thereon to be due. All unpaid taxes of Company and its
subsidiaries for periods through March 31, 2000 are reflected on the Company

are listed on Schedule 2.13 together with any liability of Company or its
subsidiaries to another party under any such agreement which is either currently

Authorities from audits or proceedings in progress. Neither Company nor any of
its subsidiaries has filed any disclosures under Section 6662 or comparable

     2.14  Employee Benefit Plans.

     (a) Schedule 2.14(a) lists, with respect to Company, any subsidiary of
Company and any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is treated
as a single employer with Company (an "ERISA Affiliate") within the meaning of
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, (i) all material employee benefit
plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) other than Foreign Plans (as defined below); (ii)
each loan to a non-officer employee in excess of $50,000, loans to officers and
directors and any stock option, stock purchase, phantom stock, stock
appreciation right, supplemental retirement, severance, sabbatical, medical,
dental, vision care, disability, employee relocation, cafeteria benefit (Code
section 125) or dependent care (Code Section 129), life insurance or accident
insurance plans, programs or arrangements; (iii) all bonus, pension, profit
sharing, savings, deferred compensation or incentive plans, programs or
arrangements; (iv) other fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or
arrangements that apply to senior management of Company and that do not
generally apply to all employees; and (v) any current or former employment or
executive compensation or severance agreements, written or otherwise, as to
which unsatisfied obligations of Company of greater than $50,000 remain for the
benefit of, or relating to, any present or former employee, consultant or
director of Company (collectively, the "Company Employee Plans").

     (b) Company has furnished or made available to Parent a copy of each of the
Company Employee Plans and related plan documents (including trust documents,
insurance policies or contracts, employee booklets, summary plan descriptions
and other authorizing documents, and any material employee communications
relating thereto) and has, with respect to each Company Employee Plan which is
subject to ERISA reporting requirements, provided or made available copies of
the Form 5500 reports filed for the last three plan years. Any Company Employee
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code either (i) has
obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable determination letter as
to its qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to the Code
effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation other than the
Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994, the Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996,
and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, or (ii) has applied to the Internal Revenue
Service for such a determination letter prior to the expiration of the requisite
period under applicable Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service
pronouncements in which to apply for such determination letter and to make any
amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination or (iii) the requisite
period for application has not expired. Company has also furnished Parent with
the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter issued with
respect to each such Company Employee Plan, and nothing has occurred since the
issuance of each such letter which would reasonably be expected to cause the
loss of the tax-qualified status of any Company Employee Plan subject to Code
Section 401(a). Company has also furnished or made available to Parent all
registration statements and prospectuses prepared in connection with each
Company Employee Plan.

     (c) (i) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree
medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as required by
applicable law; (ii) there has been no "prohibited transaction," as such term is
defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to
any Company Employee Plan, which would reasonably be expected to have, in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company; (iii) each Company Employee
Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance with
the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and regulations
(including ERISA and the Code), except as would not have, in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Company, and Company and each subsidiary or ERISA
Affiliate have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by them under, are not in default in any material respect under or
violation of, and have no knowledge of any material default or

                                      A-14
<PAGE>   136

violation by any other party to, any of the Company Employee Plans; (iv) neither
Company nor any subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is subject to any material
liability or material penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or
Title I of ERISA with respect to any of the Company Employee Plans; (v) all
material contributions required to be made by Company or any subsidiary or ERISA
Affiliate to any Company Employee Plan have been made on or before their due
dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for contributions to each Company
Employee Plan for the current plan years; (vi) with respect to each Company
Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
(excluding any such event for which the thirty (30) day notice requirement has
been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) nor any event
described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 or ERISA has occurred; (vii) no Company
Employee Plan is covered by, and neither Company nor any subsidiary or ERISA
Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any liability under Title IV of ERISA
or Section 412 of the Code; and (viii) each Company Employee Plan can be
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in
accordance with its terms, without liability to Parent (other than for benefits
accrued through the date of termination and ordinary administrative expenses
typically incurred in a termination event). With respect to each Company
Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either an employee pension plan within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an employee welfare benefit plan within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, Company has prepared in good faith and timely
filed all requisite governmental reports (which were true and correct as of the
date filed) and has properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all
notices and reports to employees required to be filed, distributed or posted
with respect to each such Company Employee Plan, except where the failure to do
so would not have a Material Adverse Effect. No suit, administrative proceeding,
action or other litigation has been brought, or to the knowledge of Company is
threatened, against or with respect to any such Company Employee Plan, including
any audit or inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of Labor. No payment
or benefit which will or may be made by Company to any employee will be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code.

     (d) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, Company and each of its
United States subsidiaries have complied except to the extent that such failure
to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Company, with (i) the applicable health care continuation and notice
provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985
("COBRA") and the regulations (including proposed regulations) thereunder, (ii)
the applicable requirements of the Family Medical and Leave Act of 1993 and the
regulations thereunder, and (iii) the applicable requirements of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations
(including proposed regulations) thereunder.

     (e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not (i) entitle any current or former employee or other service provider of
Company, any Company subsidiary or any other ERISA Affiliate to severance
benefits or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement,
or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee or service provider.

     (f) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by Company, any Company subsidiary or other ERISA
Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any Company
Employee Plan which would materially increase the expense of maintaining such
Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the most
recent fiscal quarter included in Company's financial statements.

     (g) Company does not currently maintain, sponsor, participate in or
contribute to, nor has it ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated
in, or contributed to, any pension plan (within the

                                      A-15
<PAGE>   137

meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

     (h) Neither Company nor any Company subsidiary or other ERISA Affiliate is
a party to, or has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation
under, any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

     (i) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.15 of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, there is no agreement, contract or arrangement to which Company or
any of its subsidiaries is a party that may result in the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G or Section 404 of the
Code.

     (j) With regard to each compensation and benefit plan required to be
maintained or contributed to by the law or applicable custom or rule of the
relevant jurisdiction outside of the United States (the "Foreign Plans"), (i)
each of the Foreign Plans is in material compliance with the provisions of the
laws of each jurisdiction in which each such Foreign Plan is maintained, to the
extent those laws are applicable to the Foreign Plans; (ii) all material
contributions to, and material payments from, the Foreign Plans which may have
been required to be made in accordance with the terms of any such Foreign Plan,
and, when applicable, the law of the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan is
maintained, have been timely made or shall be made by the Closing Date, and all
such contributions to the Foreign Plans, and all payments under the Foreign
Plans, for any period ending before the Closing Date that are not yet, but will
be, required to be made, are reflected as an accrued liability on the Balance
Sheet, or disclosed to Parent within fifteen (15) days following the date hereof
in Schedule 2.14(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; (iii) Company, Company
subsidiary and ERISA Affiliates have materially complied with all applicable
reporting and notice requirements, and all of the Foreign Plans have obtained
from the governmental body having jurisdiction with respect to such plans any
required determinations, if any, that such Foreign Plans are in compliance with
the laws of the relevant jurisdiction if such determinations are required in
order to give effect to the Foreign Plan; (iv) each of the Foreign Plans has
been administered in all material respects at all times in accordance with its
terms and applicable law and regulations; (v) to the knowledge of Company, there
are no pending investigations by any governmental body involving the Foreign
Plans, and no pending claims (except for claims for benefits payable in the
normal operation of the Foreign Plans), suits or proceedings against any Plan or
asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Foreign Plan; (vi) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not by
itself create or otherwise result in any liability with respect to any Foreign
Plan other than the triggering of payment to participants; and (vii) the
benefits available under any Foreign Plan in the aggregate do not provide
substantially greater benefits to employees of Company or any of its
subsidiaries participating in such plans than the benefits available under
Company Employee Plans for employees of Company in the United States.

     2.15  Certain Agreements Affected by the Merger. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transaction contemplated
hereby will (i) result in any payment (including, without limitation, severance,
unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to
any director or employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable by Company or (iii)  result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

     2.16  Employee Matters. With respect to United States employees, Company
and each of its subsidiaries are in compliance in all respects with all
currently applicable laws and regulations respecting employment, discrimination

safety and health and employment practices, and is not engaged in any unfair

                                      A-16
<PAGE>   138

labor practice, except where the failure to be in compliance or the engagement
in such unfair labor practices would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Company. Company has in all material respects withheld all amounts required by
law or by agreement to be withheld from the wages, salaries, and other payments
to employees; and is not liable for any material arrears of wages or any
material taxes or any material penalty for failure to comply with any of the
foregoing. Company is not liable for any material payment to any trust or other
fund or to any governmental or administrative authority, with respect to
unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or
obligations for employees (other than routine payments to be made in the normal
course of business and consistent with past practice). There are no pending
claims against Company or any of its subsidiaries for any material amounts under
any workers compensation plan or policy or for long term disability. Neither
Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligations under COBRA with respect
to any former employees or qualifying beneficiaries thereunder, except for
obligations that are not material in amount. With respect to employees employed
outside the United States by Company or any of its subsidiaries, Company and
each of its subsidiaries are in compliance in all respects with all currently
applicable laws and regulations respecting employment, discrimination in
employment, terms of conditions of employment, wages, hours, withholding
requirements, taxes, governmental and administrative contribution requirements
and occupational safety and health practices, and are not engaged in any unfair
labor practices in any of the countries where Company or any of its subsidiaries
has employees, except for noncompliance which, in the aggregate, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on Company. There are no material controversies
pending or, to the knowledge of Company or any of its subsidiaries, threatened,
between Company or any of its subsidiaries and any of their respective
employees, which controversies have or would reasonably be expected to result in
an action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation before any
agency, court or tribunal, foreign or domestic. Neither Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor
union contract nor does Company nor any of its subsidiaries know of any
activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any such employees. To
Company's knowledge, no employees of Company or any of its subsidiaries are in
violation of any term of any employment contract, patent disclosure agreement,
noncompetition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former employer
relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by Company because of

financial advisor, Goldman, Sachs & Co., that in such advisor's opinion, as of
the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to
the stockholders of Company.

     2.25  Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on the record date set for the
Company Stockholders Meeting is the only vote of the holders of any of Company's
capital stock necessary to adopt this Agreement.

     2.26  Board Approval. The Board of Directors of Company has (i) approved
this Agreement and the Merger, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the
Merger are advisable and in the best interests of the stockholders of Company
and are on terms that are fair to such stockholders and (iii) recommended that
the stockholders of Company adopt this Agreement and approve the consummation of
the Merger.

     2.27  Stockholder Agreement; Irrevocable Proxies. All of the persons listed
on Schedule 2.27 have agreed in writing to vote for approval of the Merger
pursuant to a Stockholder Agreement, and pursuant to an Irrevocable Proxy
attached thereto as Exhibit A.

     2.28  Section 203 of the DGCL Not Applicable. The Board of Directors of
Company has taken all actions so that the restrictions contained in Section 203
of the Delaware Law applicable to a "business combination" (as defined in
Section 203) will not apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement or the Option Agreement or the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the
Stockholder Agreement and the Option Agreement. No other state takeover statute
is applicable to this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreement, the Option Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

     2.29  Inventory. The inventories of Company disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents as of March 31, 2000 and in any subsequently filed Company SEC
Documents are stated consistently with the audited financial statements of
Company and consist of items of a quantity usable or salable in the ordinary
course of business. Since March 31, 2000, Company has continued to replenish
inventories in a normal and customary manner consistent with past practices.
Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents, Company has not received
written or oral notice that it will experience in the foreseeable future any
difficulty in obtaining, in the desired quantity and quality and at a reasonable
price and upon reasonable terms and conditions, the raw materials, supplies or
component products required for the manufacture, assembly or production of its
products. The values at which inventories are carried reflect the inventory
valuation policy of Company, which is consistent with its past practice and in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. Since March 31, 2000, due
provision was made on the books of Company in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices to provide for all slow-moving, obsolete, or
unusable inventories to their estimated useful or scrap values and such
inventory reserves are adequate to provide for such slow-moving, obsolete or
unusable inventory and inventory shrinkage. As of March 31, 2000, Company had
inventory of approximately $1,600,000 in the distribution channel and had
commitments to purchase inventory (other than purchases of supplies in the
ordinary course) in an amount of approximately $6,000,000.

created since such date, disclosed in any subsequently filed Company SEC
Documents, or as accrued on the books of Company in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices in accordance with GAAP since the last
filed Company SEC Documents, represent and will represent bona fide claims
against debtors for sales and other charges, are not subject to discount except
for normal cash and immaterial trade discount. The amount carried for doubtful
accounts and allowances disclosed in each of such Company SEC Document or
accrued on such books is, in the reasonable judgment of Company, sufficient to
provide for any losses that may be sustained on realization of the receivables.

individually accounted for more than 5% of Company's gross revenues during the

Company. As of the date hereof, no material supplier of Company has indicated
that it will stop, or decrease the rate of, supplying materials, products or
services to Company. Company has not knowingly breached, so as to provide a
benefit to Company that was not intended by the parties, any agreement with, or
engaged in any fraudulent conduct with respect to, any customer or supplier of
Company.

     2.32  Lock-up Agreements. Company has received a waiver from Goldman, Sachs
& Co. on terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent to ensure that each of the
lock-up agreements executed by the officers, directors and securityholders of
Company in connection with the initial public offering of Company (the "Lock-up
Agreements") is inapplicable to this Agreement, the Option Agreement, the
Stockholders Agreement and all of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

     2.33  Export Control Laws. Company has conducted its export transactions in
accordance with applicable provisions of United States export control laws and

          (c) There are no pending or threatened claims against Company with
     respect to such export licenses or other approvals;

          (d) There are no actions, conditions or circumstances pertaining to
     Company's export transactions that may give rise to any future claims; and

          (e) No consents or approvals for the transfer of export licenses to
     Parent are required, or such consents and approvals can be obtained
     expeditiously without material cost.

     2.34  Year 2000. Company's current products and services are "Year 2000
Compliant," where "Year 2000 Compliant" means that such products and services
have been designed and tested so that, when used in accordance with their
associated documentation, they are capable of accurately processing, providing
and/or receiving (i) date-related data from, into and between the Twentieth
(20th) and Twenty-First (21st) centuries, or (ii) date-related data in
connection with any valid date in the Twentieth (20th) and Twenty-First (21st)
centuries; provided that all other products and services used in combination in
any way with Company's current products and services properly exchange
date-related data with them. The information technology systems and

Company Disclosure Schedule, neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
made any written representations or warranties relating to the ability of any
product or service of Company or its subsidiaries to be Year 2000 Compliant.
Company has made inquiries to its key third-party vendors and providers as to
the status of their Year 2000 efforts, and has not uncovered any problems that
would aversely affect the operation of the products or that could disrupt or
harm the day-to-day functioning of the business or operations of Company.

     2.35  Accounting and Tax Matters. Except as set forth in the preliminary
letters issued by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers"), and
Arthur Andersen LLP ("Arthur Andersen"), as of the date hereof, to Company's
knowledge neither Company nor any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take
any action, nor does Company have knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that
would prevent Parent from accounting for the business combination to be effected
by the Merger as a pooling of interests in accordance with GAAP or prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code

     2.36  Affiliates. Schedule 2.36 sets forth the names and addresses of each
person who is, in Company's reasonable judgment, an affiliate (as that term is

releases with respect to pooling-of-interest accounting treatment) of Company.

     2.37  Representations Complete. None of the representations or warranties
made by Company herein or in any Schedule hereto, including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, or certificate furnished by Company pursuant to this
Agreement, or the Company SEC Documents, when all such documents are read
together in their entirety, contains or will contain at the Effective Time any
untrue statement of a material fact, or omits or will omit at the Effective Time
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained
herein or therein, in the light of the circumstances under which made, not

of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the
corporate power to own its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and as proposed to be conducted and is duly qualified to do business

20,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 5,000,000

Merger Sub. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of, or default under (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or loss of a benefit under (i) any provision of
the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, as
amended, or (ii) any material mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other

circumstance, that would prevent Parent from accounting for the business
combination to be effected by the Merger as a pooling of interests or prevent
the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

     3.11  Representations Complete. None of the representations or warranties

     4.3  No Solicitation. Company and its subsidiaries and the officers,

Proposal (as defined in Section 7.3(f)) or (ii) subject to the terms of the
immediately following sentence, engage in any discussions or negotiations with,
or disclose any nonpublic information relating to Company or any of it
subsidiaries to, or afford access to the properties, books or records of Company

be considering making, or that has made, a Takeover Proposal; provided that
nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors of Company from complying
with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
the immediately preceding sentence, if, prior to adoption of this Agreement by
Company's stockholders, an unsolicited written Takeover Proposal shall be
received by the Board of Directors of Company, then, to the extent the Board of
Directors of Company believes in good faith in the proper exercise of their
fiduciary duties to Company's stockholders (after receipt of advice from its
financial advisor), and after considering all terms and conditions of such
written Takeover Proposal, including the likelihood and timing of its
consummation, that such Takeover Proposal would result in a transaction more
favorable to Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any such more favorable Takeover
Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal") and the
Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith after advice from outside
legal counsel of nationally recognized reputation that it is necessary for the
Board of Directors of Company to comply with its fiduciary duties to
stockholders under applicable law, Company Representatives may furnish in
connection therewith information to the party making such Superior Proposal and,
subject to the provisions hereof, engage in negotiations with such party, and
endorse, recommend, approve and/or agree to such Superior Proposal and such
actions shall not be considered a breach of this Section 4.3 or any other
provisions of this Agreement; provided that in each such event Company notifies
Parent of such determination by the Board of Directors of Company and provides
Parent with a true and complete copy of the Superior Proposal received from such
third party, and provides (or has provided) or makes available to Parent all
documents containing or referring to non-public information of Company that are
supplied to such third party; provided, however, that Company provides such
non-public information pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement at least as
restrictive on such third party as the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in
Section 5.4) is on Parent; and provided further that Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of its officers, directors, employees or other
representatives to agree to or endorse any Takeover Proposal or withdraw its
recommendation of the adoption of this Agreement unless Company has provided
Parent at least three (3) days prior notice thereof. Company will promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent

                                      A-27
<PAGE>   149

after receipt of any Takeover Proposal or any notice that any person is
considering making a Takeover Proposal or any request for non-public information
relating to Company or any of its subsidiaries or for access to the properties,
books or records of Company or any of its subsidiaries by any person that has
advised Company that it may be considering making, or that has made, a Takeover
Proposal, or whose efforts to formulate a Takeover Proposal would be assisted
thereby (such notice to include the identity of such person or persons), and
will keep Parent fully informed of the status and details of any such Takeover
Proposal notice, request or correspondence or communications related thereto,
and shall provide Parent with a true and complete copy of such Takeover Proposal
notice or any amendment thereto, if it is in writing, or a complete written
summary thereof, if it is not in writing. Company shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any persons
conducted heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal.

     (a) At the Effective Time, the Company Stock Option Plans and each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Company
Stock Option Plans, whether vested or unvested, will be assumed by Parent.
Company represents and warrants to Parent that Schedule 5.9(a) hereto sets forth
a true and complete list as of the date hereof of all holders of outstanding
options under the Company Stock Option Plans, including the number of shares of
Company capital stock subject to each such option, the exercise or vesting
schedule, the exercise price per share and the term of each such option. On the
Closing Date, Company shall deliver to Parent an updated Schedule 5.9(a) hereto
current as of such date. Each such option so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the Company Stock Option Plans and the applicable stock
option agreements, immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such
option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price
for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock at which such option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.15 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Merger will not terminate any of the outstanding
options under the Company Stock Option Plans or accelerate the exercisability or
vesting of such options or the shares of Parent Common Stock which will be
subject to those options upon Parent's assumption of the options in the Merger.
It is the intention of the parties that the options so assumed by Parent
qualify, to the maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such
options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time. Within
30 business days after the Effective Time, Parent will issue to each person who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding option
under the Company Stock Option Plans a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption of such option by Parent.

     (b) All outstanding rights of Company which it may hold immediately prior
to the Effective Time to repurchase unvested shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Repurchase Options") shall continue in effect following the Merger and shall
thereafter continue to be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and
conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for the
acceleration of vesting provided for in the agreements evidencing the Repurchase
Options and except that the shares purchasable pursuant to the Repurchase
Options and the purchase price per share shall be adjusted to reflect the
Exchange Ratio.

     (c) Outstanding purchase rights under the Company ESPPs shall be exercised
on October 31, 2000, and each participant in the Company ESPPs shall accordingly
be issued, at such time, such number of shares of Parent Common Stock as will
equal (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock to which such participant
would have been entitled under the Company ESPPs multiplied by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio. Company shall cause the Company ESPPs to terminate with such exercise
date, and no

                                      A-31
<PAGE>   153

purchase rights shall be subsequently granted or exercised under the Company
ESPPs. Company employees who meet the eligibility requirements for participation
in the Parent Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall be eligible to begin payroll
deductions under that plan as of the start date of the first offering period
thereunder beginning after the Effective Time.

     (d) Within 15 business days following the date of this Agreement, Company
shall set forth on Schedule 5.9(d) a list of all persons who Company reasonably
believes are, with respect to Company and as of the date of this Agreement,
"disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder). For this purpose, Company shall assume
that the fair market value of Company Common Stock is approximately $135.00 per
share. Within a reasonable period of time after the last business day of each
month after the date of this Agreement (other than May 2000) and on or about the
date five business days prior to the expected Closing Date, Company shall revise
Schedule 5.9(d) to reflect the most recently available closing price of Company
Common Stock as of the last business day of such month and to reflect any
additional information which Company reasonably believes would impact the
determination of persons who are, with respect to Company and as of the each
such date, "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder).

     (e) Unless Parent consents otherwise in writing, Company shall take all
action necessary to terminate, or cause to terminate, before the Effective Time,
any Company Employee Plan that is a 401(k) plan or other defined contribution
retirement plan.

     (f) Company shall take all action as may be necessary or appropriate to
elect that options outstanding under the Company Incentive Plan shall be assumed
or equivalent options of Parent be substituted therefor.

     (g) Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent,
within ten business days following the date of this Agreement, a schedule
identifying, and copies of, all Foreign Plans.

     5.10  Forms S-3 and S-8. Parent agrees to file, no later than 30 business
days after the Closing (provided that Parent has received within 10 business
days after the Closing all option documentation it requires relating to the
outstanding options), (i) a registration statement on Form S-8 under the
Securities Act covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
outstanding options and shares granted to individuals for which a Form S-8
registration statement is available hereto and (ii) a registration statement on
Form S-3 under the Securities Act covering the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to outstanding options and shares granted to entities or to
individuals for which a Form S-8 registration statement is not available, which
Form S-3 shall remain current for one year from the Effective Time, under the
Company Stock Option Plans or Company ESPPs assumed by Parent or otherwise
issued in compensatory transactions to entities or to individuals not currently
providing services to Company as employees or consultants. Company shall
cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration
statements.

     5.11  Option Agreement. Company agrees to fully perform its obligations
under the Option Agreement.

     5.12  Listing of Additional Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall file with The Nasdaq National Market a Notification Form for Listing of
Additional Shares with respect to the shares referred to in Section 6.1(f).

     5.13  Nasdaq Quotation. Company and Parent agree to continue the quotation
of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock, respectively, on The Nasdaq
National Market during the term of the Agreement so that appraisal rights will
not be available to stockholders of Company under Section 262 of the Delaware
Law.

cause each of the individuals set forth on Schedule 5.14 to deliver to Parent an

continue to take all necessary action to ensure that none of this Agreement, the

hereby or thereby will be subject to the terms of any of the Lock-up Agreements.

     (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company
pursuant to the indemnification provisions of Company's Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws and any indemnification agreement with Company officers
and directors to which Company is a party, in each case in effect on the date
hereof; provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation
imposed from time to time under applicable law. Without limitation of the
foregoing, in the event any person so indemnified (an "Indemnified Party") is or
becomes involved in any capacity in any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in connection with any matter relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby occurring on or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay as incurred such
Indemnified Party's reasonable legal and other expenses (including the cost of
any investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith to the
fullest extent permitted by the Delaware Law upon receipt of any undertaking
contemplated by Section 145(e) of the Delaware Law. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.16, upon learning of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify
Parent and the Surviving Corporation (provided that the failure to so notify
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve such entity from any
liability that it may have under this Section 5.16 except to the extent that
such failure prejudices such entity), and shall deliver to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section 145(e) of the
Delaware Law.

     (b) For five years after the Effective Time, Parent will either (i) at all
times maintain at least $50,000,000 in cash, marketable securities or
unrestricted lines of credit (or any combination thereof) to be available to
indemnify the Indemnified Parties in accordance with Section 5.16(a) above or
(ii) cause the Surviving Corporation to provide officers' and directors'
liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by Company's
officers' and directors' liability insurance policy on terms substantially
similar to those of such policy in effect on the date hereof, provided that in
satisfying its obligation under this Section, Parent shall not be obligated to
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay premiums in excess of 150% of the amount
per annum Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount has been
disclosed to Parent, and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this Section 5.16, it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to such maximum amount.

     (c) To the extent there is any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) against an
Indemnified Party that arises out of or pertains to any action or omission in
his or her capacity as director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of
Company occurring prior to the Effective Time, or arises out of or pertains to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for a period of five years after
the Effective Time (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), in each
case for which such Indemnified Party is indemnified under this Section 5.16,
such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be represented by counsel, which
counsel shall be counsel of Parent (provided that if use of counsel of Parent
would be expected under applicable standards of

                                      A-33
<PAGE>   155

professional conduct to give rise to a conflict between the position of the
Indemnified Person and of Parent, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
instead to be represented by counsel selected by the Indemnified Party and
reasonably acceptable to Parent) and following the Effective Time the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received and the Surviving
Corporation and Parent will cooperate in the defense of any such matter;
provided, however, that neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall be
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld) and neither the Surviving Corporation nor
Parent shall settle any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
that includes either an admission of wrongdoing or the imposition of injunctive
relief without the written consent of the Indemnified Person (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided, further, that, in the event
that any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within such
five-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect to any such claim or
claims shall continue until the disposition of any and all such claims. The
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in addition to
local counsel) to represent them with respect to any single action unless there
is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the position of any two or more Indemnified Parties.

     (d) The provisions of this Section 5.16 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
representatives and may not be amended, altered or repealed without the prior
written consent of the affected Indemnified Party.

     5.17  Tax Treatment. The parties each intend that the Merger will qualify
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and shall
use best efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify. Each of Parent and Company
shall execute and deliver a certificate in form reasonably acceptable to the
other party setting forth factual representations and covenants that will serve
as a basis for the tax opinions described in Section 6.1(e).

     5.18  Pooling Accounting. Parent and Company shall each use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the business combination to be effected
by the Merger to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. Each of Parent and
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its "Affiliates"
(as defined in Section 5.7) not to take any action that would adversely affect
the ability of Parent to account for the business combination to be effected by
the Merger as a pooling of interests.

     5.19  Pooling Letter. Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to
be delivered to PricewaterhouseCoopers, Parent's independent accountants, as
promptly as practicable but in any event prior to the Effective Time, a letter
from Arthur Andersen, Company's independent accountants, addressed to Company
and dated the Closing Date to the effect that Company qualifies as a combining
company in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 16, Business Combinations. Such letter shall be in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Company and customary in scope and substance for letters
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with transactions of
this type and shall permit PricewaterhouseCoopers to use such letter. Company
shall provide appropriate representations as reasonably requested by Arthur
Andersen that are customary in scope and substance for such letters.

     5.20  Stockholder Litigation. Unless and until the Board of Directors of
Company has withdrawn its recommendation of the adoption of this Agreement,
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate at its own expense in
the defense of any stockholder litigation against Company and/or its directors
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Option
Agreement.

     5.21  Best Efforts and Further Assurances. Subject to Sections 4.3 and 5.1,
(a) each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby and to fulfill and
cause to be fulfilled the conditions to closing under this

                                      A-34
<PAGE>   156

Agreement, and (b) each party hereto, at the reasonable request of another party
hereto, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform such
other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable for effecting completely
the consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

     5.22  Affiliates. Company will use reasonable efforts to obtain an executed
Company Affiliate Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto (the
"Affiliate Agreement") from (a) each person identified in Schedule 2.36 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule within 15 days following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and (b) from any person who, to the knowledge of Company, may
be deemed to have become an affiliate of Company after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time as soon as practicable after attaining
such status. The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent shall be entitled to place
legends as specified in the Affiliate Agreement on the certificates evidencing
any of the Parent Common Stock to be received by (i) any affiliate of Company or
(ii) any person Parent reasonably identifies (by written notice to Company) as
being a person who may be deemed an "affiliate" within the meaning of Rule 145
promulgated under the Securities Act, and to issue appropriate stop transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for such Parent Common Stock, consistent with
the terms of the Company Affiliate Agreement, regardless of whether such person
has executed Affiliate Agreement and regardless of whether such person's name
and address appear on Schedule 2.36 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

     5.23  Execution of Certain Agreements. Company shall not execute any
agreements or enter into any arrangements, with respect to the transactions
identified on Schedule 5.23 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, without Parent's
prior written consent.

     5.24  Registration Rights. Prior to the Closing Date, Company shall take
all steps necessary to terminate any outstanding rights of Company's
securityholders relating to the registration of securities of Company, including
under Company's Investor Rights Agreement dated January 14, 2000.

     5.25  Section 280G/83(b) Agreement. Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing Date, a properly executed Section
280G/83(b) Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "280G/83(b)
Agreement") from each person reasonably identified by Company or Parent as
potentially receiving excess parachute payments, as defined in Section 280G of
the Code, in connection with the Merger. Prior to the Closing Date, Company
shall disclose the contents, and provide a copy, of the 280G/83(b) Agreement to
each person that Company reasonably believes may potentially receive excess
parachute payments, as defined in Section 280G of the Code, in connection with
the Merger.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                            CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

     6.1  Conditions to Obligations of Each Party to Effect the Merger. The
respective obligations of each party to this Agreement to consummate and effect
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the satisfaction at or
prior to the Effective Time of each of the following conditions, any of which
may be waived, in writing, by agreement of all the parties hereto:

          (a) Stockholder Approval. This Agreement shall have been adopted by
     the requisite vote of the stockholders of Company under Delaware Law.

          (b) Registration Statement Effective. The SEC shall have declared the
     Registration Statement effective. No stop order suspending the
     effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have
     been issued and no proceeding for that purpose, and no similar proceeding
     in

                                      A-35
<PAGE>   157

     respect of the Proxy Statement, shall have been initiated or threatened by
     he SEC; and all requests for additional information on the part of the SEC
     shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of the parties
     hereto.

          (c) No Injunctions or Restraints; Illegality. No temporary restraining
     order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any
     court of competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or
     prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be in effect,
     nor shall any proceeding brought by an administrative agency or commission
     or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign,
     seeking any of the foregoing be pending; nor shall there be any action
     taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, entered, enforced
     or deemed applicable to the Merger, which makes the consummation of the
     Merger illegal. In the event an injunction or other order shall have been
     issued, each party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to have such
     injunction or other order lifted.

          (d) Governmental Approvals. Parent, Company and Merger Sub and their
     respective subsidiaries shall have timely obtained from each Governmental
     Entity (i) all approvals, waivers and consents as may be required under the
     Securities Act, under state Blue Sky laws and under HSR, and (ii) all other
     approvals, waivers and consents, if any, necessary for consummation of or
     in connection with the Merger and the several transactions contemplated
     hereby, the failure to obtain which would have a Material Adverse Effect on
     the Surviving Corporation or Parent following the Effective Time.

          (e) Tax Opinion. Parent and Company shall have received substantially
     similar written opinions of Brobeck, Phleger and Harrison LLP and Hale and
     Dorr LLP, respectively, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
     them, dated on or about the date of Closing to the effect that the Merger
     will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
     the Code, and such opinions shall not have been withdrawn; provided,
     however, that if counsel to either Parent or Company is unable or unwilling
     to deliver such opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be deemed
     satisfied with respect to such party if counsel to the other party delivers
     such opinion to such party. In rendering such opinions, counsel shall be
     entitled to rely upon, among other things, reasonable assumptions as well
     as representations of Parent, Merger Sub and Company. In addition, Parent
     and Company shall have received from such respective firms such tax
     opinions as may be required by the SEC in connection with the filing of the
     Registration Statement.

          (f) Listing of Additional Shares. The shares of Parent Common Stock
     issuable upon conversion of the Company Common Stock in the Merger and upon
     exercise of the options under the Company Stock Option Plans assumed by
     Parent shall have been approved for listing on The Nasdaq National Market.

          (g) Letters of Accountants. PricewaterhouseCoopers, Parent's
     independent accountants, shall have received the letter referred to in
     Section 5.19 from Arthur Andersen to the effect that Company qualifies as a
     combining company in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
     Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations, and Parent shall
     have received a similar letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers to the effect
     that the Merger qualifies for pooling of interests accounting treatment if
     consummated in accordance with this Agreement. Such letter from Arthur
     Andersen shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Company, and such
     letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers shall be in a form reasonably
     satisfactory to Parent, and each such letter shall be customary in scope
     and substance for letters delivered by independent accountants in
     connection with transactions of this type.

     6.2  Additional Conditions to Obligations of Company. The obligations of
Company to consummate and effect the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
subject to the satisfaction at or

                                      A-36

     which representations and warranties as so qualified shall be true and
     correct in all respects) both when made and on and as of the Effective Time
     as though such representations and warranties were made on and as of such
     time, except where the failure to be so true and correct, without regard to
     any materiality qualifications contained therein, individually or in the
     aggregate does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and (ii)
     Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed and complied in all material
     respects with all covenants, obligations and conditions of this Agreement
     required to be performed and complied with by them as of the Effective
     Time.

          (b) Certificate of Parent. Company shall have been provided with a

obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate and effect the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the
Effective Time of each of the following additional conditions, any of which may
be waived, in writing, by Parent:

          (a) Representations, Warranties and Covenants. (i) The representations
     and warranties of Company in this Agreement shall be true and correct in
     all material respects (except for such representations and warranties that
     are qualified by their terms by a reference to materiality which
     representations and warranties as so qualified shall be true and correct in
     all respects) both when made and on and as of the Effective Time as though
     such representations and warranties were made on and as of such time,
     except where the failure to be so true and correct, without regard to any
     materiality qualifications contained therein, individually or in the
     aggregate does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect on Company and (ii)
     Company shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all
     covenants, obligations and conditions of this Agreement required to be
     performed and complied with by it as of the Effective Time.

          (b) Certificate of Company. Parent shall have been provided with a
     certificate executed on behalf of Company by its President and Chief
     Financial Officer certifying that the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a)

          (c) Third Party Consents. Parent shall have been furnished with
     evidence satisfactory to it of the consent or approval of those persons
     whose consent or approval shall be required in connection with the Merger
     under any material contract of Company or any of its subsidiaries or
     otherwise set forth on Schedule 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
     except where failure to obtain such consent would not have a Material
     Adverse Effect on Company.

          (d) Injunctions or Restraints on Conduct of Business. No temporary
     restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order
     issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory

     of the business of Company and its subsidiaries, following the Merger shall
     be in effect, nor shall any proceeding brought by an administrative agency
     or commission or other Governmental Entity, domestic or foreign, seeking
     the foregoing be pending.

          (e) Employment and Non-Competition Agreements. Each of the employees
     of Company set forth on paragraph (a) of Schedule 5.14 and at least 75% of
     the employees of Company set forth

                                      A-37
<PAGE>   159

                                  ARTICLE VII

                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     7.1  Termination. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
stockholders of Company, this Agreement may be terminated:

          (a) by mutual consent of Parent and Company;

          (b) by either Parent or Company, if, without fault of the terminating
     party, the Closing shall not have occurred on or before October 31, 2000 or
     such later date as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto (the
     "Final Date"); provided, however, that the Final Date shall be extended to
     December 31, 2000 in the event that if the only reason the Closing shall
     not have occurred by October 31, 2000 is the failure of the conditions set
     forth in Section 6.1(b) and/or Section 6.1(d) (although such extension
     shall not occur if the failure of such conditions has been caused or
     resulted from one party's action or failure to act constituting a breach of
     this Agreement and the other party does not consent to such extension); and
     provided further that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
     Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose action or failure
     to act has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to
     occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act constitutes
     a breach of this Agreement;

          (c) by Parent, if (i) Company shall breach any of its representations,
     warranties or obligations hereunder to an extent that would cause the
     condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) not to be satisfied and such breach
     shall not have been cured within ten (10) business days of receipt by
     Company of written notice of such breach (and Parent shall not have
     willfully breached any of its covenants hereunder, which breach is not
     cured), (ii) the Board of Directors of Company shall have withdrawn or
     modified its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in a manner
     adverse to Parent or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing, (iii)
     Company shall have failed to comply with Section 4.3, (iv) the Board of
     Directors of Company shall have recommended, endorsed, accepted or agreed
     to a Takeover Proposal or shall have resolved to do so, or (v) for any
     reason Company fails to call and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting by
     September 30, 2000 or in the event the condition set forth in Section
     6.1(b) shall not have been satisfied by September 30, 2000 under
     circumstances in which it can be reasonably expected that the Final Date
     will be extended pursuant to the proviso set forth in Section 7.1(b),
     December 15, 2000;

          (d) by Company, if Parent shall breach any of its representations,
     warranties or obligations hereunder to an extent that would cause the
     condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) not to be satisfied and such breach
     shall not have been cured within ten (10) business days following receipt
     by Parent of written notice of such breach (and Company shall not have
     willfully breached any of its covenants hereunder, which breach is not
     cured);

          (e) by Parent if a Trigger Event (as defined in Section 7.3(e)) or
     Takeover Proposal shall have occurred and the Board of Directors of Company
     in connection therewith, does not within ten

                                      A-38
<PAGE>   160

     (10) business days of such occurrence (i) reconfirm its approval and
     recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
     and (ii) reject such Takeover Proposal or Trigger Event (in the case of a
     Trigger Event involving a tender or exchange offer); or

          (f) by either Parent or Company if (i) any permanent injunction or
     other order of a court or other competent authority preventing the
     consummation of the Merger shall have become final and nonappealable or
     (ii) any required approval of the stockholders of Company shall not have
     been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote upon a
     vote held at a duly held meeting of stockholders or at any adjournment
     thereof (provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
     subsection (ii) shall not be available to either party where the failure to
     obtain such stockholder approval shall have been caused by the action or
     failure to act of such party and such action or failure constitutes a
     breach by such party of this Agreement).

     7.2  Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or Company
or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or affiliates, except to
the extent that such termination results from the breach by a party hereto of
any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement;
provided that (a) the provisions of Section 5.4 (Confidentiality), Section 7.3
(Expenses and Termination Fees), this Section 7.2 and Article VIII shall remain
in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement and (b)
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability in connection with a
willful breach of the representations or warranties of such party to this
Agreement or the breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement.

     7.3  Expenses and Termination Fees.

     (a) Subject to subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 7.3,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of its advisers,
accountants and legal counsel) shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense, except that expenses incurred in connection with printing the Proxy
Materials and the Registration Statement, registration and filing fees incurred
in connection with the Registration Statement, the Proxy Materials and the
listing of additional shares pursuant to Section 6.1(f) and fees, costs and
expenses associated with compliance with applicable state securities laws in
connection with the Merger shall be shared equally by Company and Parent.

     (b) In the event that (i) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(e); (ii) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(iii) as a result of the failure by Company, its stockholders who are
parties to the Stockholder Agreements, and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees, affiliates and controlling persons, or any person
authorized by such persons, to comply with the requirements of Section 4.3;
(iii) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iv) and
at the time of such recommendation, endorsement, acceptance, agreement or
resolution under Section 7.1(c)(iv), there shall not exist circumstances giving
rise to a Material Adverse Effect on Parent; (iv) Parent (or in the case of
Section 7.1(f)(ii), Company) shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(ii) or 7.1(f)(ii) and, prior to such withdrawal, modification or
stockholder rejection, there shall have been (A) a Trigger Event with respect to
Company or (B) a Takeover Proposal with respect to Company which at the time of
such withdrawal, modification or stockholder rejection shall not have been
rejected by Company or withdrawn by the other party and at the time of such
withdrawal, modification or stockholder rejection under Section 7.1(c)(ii) or
7.1(f)(ii), there shall not exist circumstances giving rise to a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent; or (v) Parent (or in the case of Section 7.1(b),
Company, provided that this clause (v) shall not apply if an action or

                                      A-39
<PAGE>   161

failure to act on the part of Parent has been the cause of or resulted in the
failure of the Merger to occur on or before the date specified in Section 7.1(b)
and such action or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement) shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b), 7.1(c)(i) or 7.1(c)(v) due
in whole or in part to any failure by Company to use its reasonable best efforts
to perform and comply with all agreements and conditions required by this
Agreement to be performed or complied with by Company prior to or on the Closing
Date or any failure by Company's affiliates to take any actions required to be
taken hereby, and prior thereto there shall have been (A) a Trigger Event with
respect to Company or (B) a Takeover Proposal with respect to Company which
shall not have been rejected by Company or withdrawn by the other party, then
Company shall promptly reimburse Parent for all of the out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Parent in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the fees and
expenses of its advisors, accountants and legal counsel), and, in addition to
any other remedies Parent may have, Company shall promptly pay to Parent the sum
of $150,000,000.

     (c) In the event that (i) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(c)(i) or 7.1(c)(v) under circumstances not described in Section
7.3(b)(v); or (ii) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(ii) or 7.1(f)(ii) (under circumstances not described in Section

solicitation subject to Rule 14a-11 under the Exchange Act) or seeking to advise
or influence any Person with respect to the voting of any voting securities of

Proposal shall occur on the date a written agreement is entered into with
respect to a merger or other business combination involving Company or the
acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Company, or sale or transfer of any material assets (excluding the sale or

voting power of Company, following a tender or exchange offer.

                             STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

     STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of May 4, 2000, by and
between Cisco Systems, Inc., a California corporation ("Parent"), and ArrowPoint
Communications, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company").

     WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Company, Parent and Archer Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), are entering into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Reorganization Agreement"), which
provides, among other things, that upon the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Company (the "Merger"), with
Company continuing as the surviving corporation; and

     WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter
into the Reorganization Agreement, Parent has required that Company agree, and
Company has so agreed, to grant to Parent an option with respect to certain
shares of Company's common stock upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Reorganization Agreement,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1. Grant of Option. Company hereby grants to Parent an irrevocable option
(the "Company Option") to purchase up to 6,974,047 shares (the "Company Shares")
of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Company (the "Company Common
Stock") in the manner set forth below at a price (the "Exercise Price") of $135
per Company Share, payable in cash. Capitalized terms used herein but not
defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Reorganization
Agreement.

     2. Exercise of Option. The Company Option may be exercised by Parent, in
whole or in part at any time or from time to time after the occurrence of any of
the events that obligates Company to pay Parent the Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 7.3(b) or 7.3(c) of the Reorganization Agreement. In the event Parent
wishes to exercise the Company Option, Parent shall deliver to Company a written
notice (an "Exercise Notice") specifying the total number of Company Shares it
wishes to purchase. Each closing of a purchase of Company Shares (a "Closing")
shall occur at a place, on a date and at a time designated by Parent in an
Exercise Notice delivered at least two business days prior to the date of the
Closing for such purchase.

     3. Termination of Option. The Company Option shall terminate upon the
earlier of: (a) the Effective Time; (b) the termination of the Reorganization
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1 thereof (other than a termination in
connection with which Parent is entitled to any payments as specified in
Sections 7.3(b) or (c) thereof); (c) 180 days following any termination of the
Reorganization Agreement in connection with which Parent is entitled to a
payment as specified in Section 7.3(b) thereof (or if, at the expiration of such
180-day period, the Company Option cannot be exercised by reason of any
applicable judgment, decree, order, law or regulation, ten business days after
such impediment to exercise shall have been removed or shall have become final
and not subject to appeal); or (d) 270 days following any termination of the
Reorganization Agreement in connection with which Parent is entitled to a
payment as specified in Section 7.3(c) thereof (or if, at the expiration of such
270-day period, the Company Option cannot be exercised by reason of any
applicable judgment, decree, order, law or regulation, ten business days after
such impediment to exercise shall have been removed or shall have become final
and not subject to appeal); provided, however, that if Parent has exercised the
Company Option but the Closing has not occurred as provided in Section 5 with
respect to such exercise, the

                                       B-1
<PAGE>   167

Company Option shall survive until immediately following such Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Option may not be exercised if Parent
is in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or in the Reorganization Agreement.

     4. Conditions to Closing. The obligation of Company to issue the Company
Shares to Parent hereunder is subject to the conditions that (a) all waiting
periods, if any, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("HSR Act"),
applicable to the issuance of the Company Shares hereunder shall have expired or
have been terminated; (b) all consents, approvals, orders or authorizations of,
or registrations, declarations or filings with, any federal, state or local
administrative agency or commission or other federal, state or local
governmental authority or instrumentality, if any, required in connection with
the issuance of the Company Shares hereunder shall have been obtained or made,
as the case may be; and (c) no preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order by any court of competent jurisdiction prohibiting or otherwise
restraining such issuance shall be in effect. Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to satisfy such conditions as soon as practicable after Parent
exercises the Company Option.

     5. Closing. At any Closing, (a) Company will deliver to Parent a single
certificate in definitive form representing the number of Company Shares
designated by Parent in its Exercise Notice, such certificate to be registered
in the name of Parent and to bear the legend set forth in Section 11, and (b)
Parent will deliver to Company the aggregate price for the Company Shares so
designated and being purchased by wire transfer of immediately available funds
or certified check or bank check. At any Closing at which Parent is exercising
the Company Option in part, Parent shall present and surrender this Agreement to
Company, and Company shall deliver to Parent an executed new agreement with the
same terms as this Agreement evidencing the right to purchase the balance of the
shares of Company Common Stock purchasable hereunder.

Company Common Stock which may be purchased hereunder.

     of Company Common Stock as of the date (the "Notice Date") notice of
     exercise of the Put or Call is given to a party (defined as the higher of
     (A) the price per share offered as of the Notice Date pursuant to any
     tender or exchange offer or other Takeover Proposal that was made prior to
     the Notice Date and not terminated or withdrawn as of the Notice Date (the
     "Tender Price") or (B) the average of the closing prices of shares of
     Company Common Stock on The Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading days
     immediately preceding the Notice Date (the "Market Price")), and the
     Exercise Price, multiplied by the number of Company Shares purchasable
     pursuant to the Company Option (or portion thereof with respect to which
     Parent is exercising its rights under this Section 8), but only if the
     Market/Tender Offer Price is greater than the Exercise Price.

          (ii) The Exercise Price paid by Parent for the Company Shares acquired
     pursuant to the Company Option plus the difference between the
     Market/Tender Offer Price and the Exercise Price, but only if the
     Market/Tender Offer Price is greater than the Exercise Price, multiplied by
     the number of Company Shares so purchased.

          (iii) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above, in no event
     shall the proceeds payable to Parent pursuant to this Section 8 exceed the
     sum of (x) $150,000,000 plus (y) the Exercise Price multiplied by the
     number of Company Shares purchased minus (z) any amount paid to Parent by
     Company pursuant to Section 7.3(b) or Section 7.3(c) of the Reorganization
     Agreement.

     (b) For purposes of Section 8(a), the Tender Price shall be the highest
price per share offered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer or other Takeover
Proposal during the Repurchase Period.

     (c) Payment and Redelivery of Company Option or Shares. In the event Parent
or Company exercises its rights under this Section 8, Company shall, within ten
business days of the Notice Date, pay the required amount to Parent in
immediately available funds and Parent shall surrender to Company the Company
Option or the certificates evidencing the Company Shares purchased by Parent
pursuant thereto, and Parent shall warrant that it owns such shares and that
such shares are then free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and
encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever.

     9. Registration Rights.

     (a) Following any exercise of the Company Option, Parent may by written
notice (the "Registration Notice") to Company request Company to register under
the Securities Act all or any part of the shares of Company Common Stock
acquired pursuant to this Agreement (the "Restricted Shares") beneficially owned
by Parent (the "Registrable Securities") pursuant to a bona fide firm commitment
underwritten public offering in which Parent and the underwriters shall effect
as wide a distribution of such Registrable Securities as is reasonably
practicable and shall use their reasonable best efforts to prevent any Person
(including any Group) and its affiliates from purchasing through such offering
Restricted Shares representing more than 1% of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock of Company on a fully diluted basis (a "Permitted Offering"); provided,
further, that any such Registration Notice must relate to a number of shares
equal to at least 2% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and that
any rights to require registrations hereunder shall terminate with respect to
any shares that may be sold pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act.
The Registration Notice shall include a certificate executed by Parent and its
proposed managing underwriter, which underwriter shall be an investment banking
firm of nationally recognized standing (the "Manager"), stating that (i) they
have a good faith intention to commence promptly a Permitted Offering and (ii)
the Manager in good faith believes that, based on the then prevailing market
conditions, it will be able to sell the Registrable Securities at a per

                                       B-4
<PAGE>   170

share price equal to at least 80% of the Fair Market Value of such shares. For
purposes of this Section 9, the term "Fair Market Value" shall mean the per
share average of the closing sale prices of Company's Common Stock on The Nasdaq
National Market for the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of the
Registration Notice.

     (b) Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect, as promptly as
practicable, the registration under the Securities Act of the unpurchased
Registrable Securities; provided, however, that (i) Parent shall not be entitled
to more than an aggregate of two effective registration statements hereunder and
(ii) Company will not be required to file any such registration statement during
any period of time (not to exceed 40 days after such request in the case of
clause (A) below or 90 days in the case of clauses (B) and (C) below) when (A)
Company is in possession of material non-public information which it reasonably
believes (i) would be detrimental to be disclosed at such time and, (ii) after
consultation with counsel to Company, such information would have to be
disclosed if a registration statement were filed at that time; (B) Company is
required under the Securities Act to include audited financial statements for
any period in such registration statement and such financial statements are not
yet available for inclusion in such registration statement; or (C) Company
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such registration would interfere
with any financing, acquisition or other material transaction involving Company
or any of its affiliates. If consummation of the sale of any Registrable
Securities pursuant to a registration hereunder does not occur within 120 days
after the filing with the SEC of the initial registration statement, the
provisions of this Section 9 shall again be applicable to any proposed
registration; provided, however, that Parent shall not be entitled to request
more than two registrations pursuant to this Section 9. Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any Registrable Securities registered pursuant
to this Section 9 to be qualified for sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws
of such jurisdictions as Parent may reasonably request and shall continue such
registration or qualification in effect in such jurisdiction; provided, however,
that Company shall not be required to qualify to do business in, or consent to
general service of process in, any jurisdiction by reason of this provision.

     (c) The registration rights set forth in this Section 9 are subject to the
condition that Parent shall provide Company with such information with respect
to Parent's Registrable Securities, the plans for the distribution thereof, and
such other information with respect to Parent as, in the reasonable judgment of
counsel for Company, is necessary to enable Company to include in such
registration statement all material facts required to be disclosed with respect
to a registration thereunder.

     (d) If Company's securities of the same type as the Registrable Securities
are then authorized for quotation or trading or listing on the New York Stock
Exchange, Nasdaq National Market System, or any other securities exchange or
automated quotations system, Company, upon the request of Parent, shall promptly
file an application, if required, to authorize for quotation, trading or listing
the shares of Registrable Securities on such exchange or system and will use its
reasonable efforts to obtain approval, if required, of such quotation, trading
or listing as soon as practicable.

     (e) A registration effected under this Section 9 shall be effected at
Company's expense, except for underwriting discounts and commissions and the
fees and the expenses of counsel to Parent, and Company shall provide to the
underwriters such documentation (including certificates, opinions of counsel and
"comfort" letters from auditors) as are customary in connection with
underwritten public offerings as such underwriters may reasonably require. In
connection with any such registration, the parties agree (i) to indemnify each
other and the underwriters in the customary manner and (ii) to enter into an
underwriting agreement in form and substance customary to transactions of this
type with the Manager and the other underwriters participating in such offering.

                                       B-5
<PAGE>   171

     10. Adjustment Upon Changes in Capitalization.

     (a) In the event of any change in Company Common Stock by reason of stock
dividends, splitups, mergers (other than the Merger), recapitalizations,
combinations, exchange of shares or the like, the type and number of shares or
securities subject to the Company Option, and the purchase price per share
provided in Section 1, shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper provision
shall be made in the agreements governing such transaction so that Parent shall
receive, upon exercise of the Company Option, the number and class of shares or
other securities or property that Parent would have received in respect of the
Company Common Stock if the Company Option had been exercised immediately prior
to such event or the record date therefor, as applicable.

     (b) In the event that Company shall enter in an agreement: (i) to
consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Parent or one of its
subsidiaries, and Company shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
of such consolidation or merger; (ii) to permit any person, other than Parent or
one of its subsidiaries, to merge into Company and Company shall be the
continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the
then-outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall be changed into or
exchanged for stock or other securities of Company or any other person or cash
or any other property or the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such merger shall after such merger represent less than 50%
of the outstanding shares and share equivalents of the merged company; or (iii)
to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any
person, other than Parent or one of its subsidiaries, then, and in each such
case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provisions so
that upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, Parent shall receive for each Company Share with
respect to which the Company Option has not been exercised an amount of
consideration in the form of and equal to the per share amount of consideration
that would be received by the holder of one share of Company Common Stock less
the Exercise Price (and, in the event of an election or similar arrangement with
respect to the type of consideration to be received by the holders of Company
Common Stock, subject to the foregoing, proper provision shall be made so that
the holder of the Company Option would have the same election or similar rights
as would the holder of the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which
the Company Option is then exercisable).

     11. Restrictive Legends. Each certificate representing shares of Company
Common Stock issued to Parent hereunder shall include a legend in substantially
the following form:

          THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
     REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY BE
     REOFFERED OR SOLD ONLY IF SO REGISTERED OR IF AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH
     REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE. SUCH SECURITIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL
     RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AS SET FORTH IN THE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT, DATED
     AS OF MAY 4, 2000, A COPY OF WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE ISSUER.

     12. Binding Effect; No Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, neither
this agreement nor the rights or the obligations of either party hereto are
assignable, except by operation of law, or with the written consent of the other
party. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted assigns any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever by reason of
this Agreement. Any Restricted Shares sold by Parent in compliance with the
provisions of Section 9 shall, upon consummation of such sale, be free of the
restrictions imposed with respect to such shares by this Agreement, unless and
until Parent shall repurchase or otherwise become the

                                       B-6
<PAGE>   172

beneficial owner of such shares, and any transferee of such shares shall not be
entitled to the rights of Parent. Certificates representing shares sold in a
registered public offering pursuant to Section 9 shall not be required to bear
the legend set forth in Section 11.

     13. Specific Performance. The parties recognize and agree that if for any
reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable
harm or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to other remedies, the
other party shall be entitled to seek an injunction restraining any violation or
threatened violation of the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that any
action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement,
neither party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense, that there
is adequate remedy at law.

     14. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule
relating thereto) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or any of them with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

     15. Further Assurance. Each party will execute and deliver all such further
documents and instruments and take all such further action as may be necessary
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

     16. Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. In
the event any court or other competent authority holds any provision of this
Agreement to be null, void or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate
in good faith the execution and delivery of an amendment to this Agreement in
order, as nearly as possible, to effectuate, to the extent permitted by law, the
intent of the parties hereto with respect to such provision. Each party agrees
that, should any court or other competent authority hold any provision of this
Agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party
to take any action inconsistent herewith, or not take any action required
herein, the other party shall not be entitled to specific performance of such
provision or part hereof or to any other remedy, including but not limited to
money damages, for breach hereof or of any other provision of this Agreement or
part hereof as the result of such holding or order.

     17. Notices. Any notice or communication required or permitted hereunder
shall be in writing and either delivered personally, telegraphed or telecopied
or sent by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed to
be given, dated and received when so delivered personally, telegraphed or
telecopied or, if mailed, five business days after the date of mailing to the
following address or telecopy number, or to such other address or addresses as
such person may subsequently designate by notice given hereunder.

                             STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT

     THIS STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of May 4,
2000, by and among Cisco Systems, Inc., a California corporation ("Parent"),
Archer Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the undersigned stockholder
("Stockholder") of ArrowPoint Communications, Inc., a corporation existing under
the laws of Delaware ("Company").

                                   RECITALS:

     WHEREAS, Parent has agreed to acquire the outstanding securities of Company
pursuant to a statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the
"Merger") effected in part through the conversion of each outstanding share of
capital stock of Company (the "Company Capital Stock"), into shares of common
stock of Parent (the "Parent Shares") at the rate set forth in the Agreement and
Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of May 4, 2000 by and among Parent,
Merger Sub and Company (such agreement as it may be amended or restated is
hereinafter referred to as the "Reorganization Agreement") (the "Transaction");

     WHEREAS, Stockholder is the registered and beneficial owner of such number
of shares of the outstanding Company Capital Stock as is indicated on the
signature page of this Agreement (the "Shares"); and

     WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent to enter into the Transaction, certain
stockholders of Company have agreed to vote the Shares and any other such shares
of Company Capital Stock so as to facilitate consummation of the Transaction.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual agreements,
provisions and covenants set forth in the Reorganization Agreement, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

     1. Share Ownership and Agreement to Retain Shares.

          1.1  Encumbrance.

          (a) Stockholder represents, warrants and covenants to Parent that (i)
     Stockholder is the beneficial owner of that number of Shares of Company
     Capital Stock set forth on the signature page hereto; (ii) except as
     otherwise set forth on the signature page hereto, Stockholder has held such
     Company Capital Stock at all times since the date set forth on such
     signature page; (iii) the Shares constitute the Stockholder's entire
     interest in the outstanding Company Capital Stock; (iv) no other person or
     entity not a signatory to this Agreement has a beneficial interest in or a
     right to acquire the Shares or any portion of the Shares; and (v) the
     Shares are and will be at all times up until the Expiration Date free and
     clear of any liens, claims, options, charges or other encumbrances. As used
     herein, the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the earlier to occur of (A)
     the Effective Time (as defined in the Reorganization Agreement) of the
     Transaction, and (B) the termination of the Reorganization Agreement.

          1.2  New Shares. Stockholder agrees that any shares of Company Capital
     Stock that Stockholder purchases or with respect to which Stockholder
     otherwise acquires beneficial ownership after the date of this Agreement
     and prior to the Expiration Date ("New Shares") shall be subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they
     constituted Shares.

                                       C-1
<PAGE>   176

     2. Agreement to Vote Shares. Prior to the Expiration Date, at every meeting
of the stockholders of Company called with respect to any of the following, and
at every adjournment thereof, and on every action or approval by written
resolution of the stockholders of Company with respect to any of the following,
Stockholder shall vote the Shares and any New Shares in favor of approval of the
Transaction and any matter that could reasonably be expected to facilitate the
Transaction.

     3. Irrevocable Proxy. Stockholder is hereby delivering to Parent a duly
executed proxy in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Proxy") with
respect to each meeting of stockholders of Company, such Proxy to cover the
total number of Shares and New Shares in respect of which Stockholder is
entitled to vote at any such meeting. Upon the execution of this Agreement by
the Stockholder, the Stockholder hereby revokes any and all prior proxies given
by the Stockholder with respect to the Shares and agrees not to grant any
subsequent proxies with respect to the Shares or any New Shares until after the
Expiration Date.

     4. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Stockholder. Stockholder
hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Parent as follows:

          (a) Until the Expiration Date, the Stockholder will not (i) initiate
     or solicit, directly or indirectly, any proposal, plan of offer to acquire
     all or any substantial part of the business or properties or Company
     Capital Stock, whether by merger, purchase of assets, tender offer or
     otherwise, or to liquidate Company or otherwise distribute to the
     Stockholders of Company all or any substantial part of the business,
     properties or Company Capital Stock (each, an "Acquisition Proposal"); (ii)
     initiate, directly or indirectly, any contact with any person in an effort
     to or with a view towards soliciting any Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
     furnish information concerning Company's business, properties or assets to
     any corporation, partnership, person or other entity or group (other than
     Parent or Merger Sub, or any associate, agent or representative of Parent
     or Merger Sub), under any circumstances that would reasonably be expected
     to relate to an actual or potential Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) negotiate
     or enter into discussions or an agreement, directly or indirectly, with any
     entity or group with respect of any potential Acquisition Proposal provided
     that, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), the foregoing shall not
     prevent Stockholder, in Stockholder's capacity as a director or officer (as
     the case may be) of Company, from taking any actions permitted under
     Section 4.3 of the Reorganization Agreement. In the event the Stockholder
     shall receive or become aware of any Acquisition Proposal subsequent to the
     date hereof, such Stockholder shall promptly inform Parent as to any such
     matter and the details thereof to the extent possible without breaching any
     other agreement to which such Stockholder is a party or violating its
     fiduciary duties.

          (b) Stockholder is competent to execute and deliver this Stockholder
     Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
     transactions contemplated hereby. This Stockholder Agreement has been duly
     and validly executed and delivered by Stockholder and, assuming the due
     authorization, execution and delivery by Parent, constitutes a legal, valid
     and binding obligation of Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in
     accordance with its terms except that (i) the enforceability thereof may be
     subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws, now or
     hereinafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) the
     availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunctive or other
     forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and would be
     subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor
     may be brought.

          (c) The execution and delivery of this Stockholder Agreement by
     Stockholder does not, and the performance of this Stockholder Agreement by
     Stockholder shall not result in any breach of or constitute a default (or
     an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)

                                       C-2
<PAGE>   177

     under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
     or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or encumbrance, on
     any of the Shares or New Shares pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
     indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
     instrument or obligation to which Stockholder is a party or by which
     Stockholder or the Shares or New Shares are or will be bound or affected.

     5. Additional Documents. Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees to execute
and deliver any additional documents necessary or desirable, in the reasonable
opinion of Parent, to carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement.

     6. Consent and Waiver. Stockholder hereby gives any consents or waivers
that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Transaction under the
terms of any agreement to which Stockholder is a party or pursuant to any rights
Stockholder may have in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company.

     7. Termination. This Agreement and the Proxy delivered in connection
herewith shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect as of the
Expiration Date.

     8. Confidentiality. Stockholder agrees (i) to hold any information
regarding this Agreement and the Transaction in strict confidence, and (ii) not
to divulge any such information to any third person, until such time as the
Transaction has been publicly disclosed by Parent, except as may otherwise be
required by law.

     9. Miscellaneous.

          9.1  Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
     this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
     void or unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms, provisions,
     covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
     effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

          9.2  Binding Effect and Assignment. This Agreement and all of the
     provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
     parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but,
     except as otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement
     nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may
     be assigned by either of the parties hereto without the prior written
     consent of the other. This Agreement is binding upon Stockholder in
     Stockholder's capacity as a stockholder of Company (and not in
     Stockholder's capacity as a director or officer, as the case may be, of
     Company) and only with respect to the specific matters set forth herein.

          9.3  Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may not be modified,
     amended, altered or supplemented except by the execution and delivery of a
     written agreement executed by the parties hereto.

          9.4 Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto
     acknowledge that Parent will be irreparably harmed and that there will be
     no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or
     agreements of Stockholder set forth herein. Therefore, it is agreed that,
     in addition to any other remedies that may be available to Parent or Merger
     Sub upon any such violation, Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to
     seek to enforce such covenants and agreements by specific performance,
     injunctive relief or by any other means available to Parent or Merger Sub
     at law or in equity and the Stockholder hereby waives the absence of
     irreparable harm as a defense in connection with such enforcement and
     waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in
     connection with such enforcement.

Gentlemen:

     Attached is our opinion letter dated May 4, 2000 with respect to the
fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Company Shares"), of
ArrowPoint Communications, Inc. (the "Company") of the exchange ratio of 2.1218
shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Cisco Systems, Inc. (the
"Buyer") to be received for each Company Share pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of May 4, 2000, among Buyer,
ArrowPoint Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer, and the
Company.

     The foregoing opinion letter is provided for the information and assistance
of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of
the transaction contemplated therein and is not to be used, circulated, quoted
or otherwise referred to for any other purpose, nor is it to be filed with,
included in or referred to in whole or in part in any registration statement,
proxy statement or any other document, except in accordance with our prior
written consent.

                                          Very truly yours,

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

May 4, 2000

Board of Directors
ArrowPoint Communications, Inc.
50 Nagog Park
Acton, Massachusetts 01720

Gentlemen:

     You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of
view to the holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001
per share (the "Company Shares"), of ArrowPoint Communications, Inc. (the
"Company") of the exchange ratio of 2.1218 shares of Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share (the "Buyer Shares"), of Cisco Systems, Inc. (the "Buyer") to
be received for each Company Share (the "Exchange Ratio") pursuant to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of May 4, 2000, among
Buyer, ArrowPoint Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer,
and the Company (the "Agreement").

     Goldman, Sachs & Co., as part of its investment banking business, is
continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, competitive
biddings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. We are
familiar with the Company, having provided certain investment banking services
to the Company from time to time, including having acted as managing underwriter
of the initial public offering of Company Shares in March 2000 and having acted
as its financial advisor in connection with, and having participated in certain
of the negotiations leading to, the Agreement. We also have provided certain
investment banking services to Buyer from time to time, including having acted
as financial advisor in various strategic advisory assignments including, but
not limited to, the acquisition of the optical systems business of Pirelli SpA
in December 1999. We may provide investment banking services to Buyer in the
future. Goldman, Sachs & Co. provides a full range of financial advisory and
securities services and, in the course of its normal trading activities, may
from time to time effect transactions and hold positions in securities,
including derivative securities, of the Company or Buyer for its own account and
for the accounts of customers.

     In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the
Agreement; the Registration Statement of the Company on Form S-1 dated March 30,
2000 relating to the initial public offering of Company Shares, including the
Prospectus therein; a draft of the Registration Statement of

                                       D-2
<PAGE>   182

the Company on Form S-4 dated the date hereof, including a draft of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus relating to the Special Meeting of Stockholders of the
Company to be held in connection with the Agreement; Annual Reports to
Stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Buyer for the five fiscal
years ended July 31, 1999; certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company and the Buyer; certain other communications
from the Company and the Buyer to their respective stockholders; and certain
internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its
management. We also have held discussions with members of the senior management
of the Company and Buyer regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale
for, and the potential benefits of, the transaction contemplated by the
Agreement and the past and current business operations, financial condition and
future prospects of their respective companies. In addition, we have reviewed
the reported price and trading activity for the Company Shares and the Buyer
Shares, which, like many Internet related stocks, have been and are likely to
continue to be subject to significant short term price and trading volatility,
compared with certain financial and stock market information for the Company and
the Buyer with similar information for certain other companies the securities of
which are publicly traded, reviewed the financial terms of certain recent
business combinations in the communications technology industry specifically and
in other industries generally and performed such other studies and analyses as
we considered appropriate.

     We have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial
and other information discussed with or reviewed by us and have assumed such
accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering this opinion. As you are
aware, Buyer did not make available its forecasts of future financial
performance. Accordingly, our review of such matters was limited to discussions
with the senior management of the Buyer of certain publicly available estimates
by research analysts covering the Buyer, which according to Buyer, do not
materially differ from the view of management of the Buyer as to the future
performance of the Buyer. In addition, we have not made an independent
evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities of the Company or Buyer or
any of their subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal. In rendering our opinion, we are not addressing the
underlying business decision of the Company to effect the transaction
contemplated by the Agreement. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed
herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors
of the Company in connection with its consideration of the transaction
contemplated by the Agreement and such opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of Company Shares should vote with respect
to such transaction.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and based upon such other matters
as we consider relevant, it is our opinion that as of the date hereof the
Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view
to the holders of Company Shares.

                                          Very truly yours,

                                          /s/  GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.
                                          (GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.)

                     INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

ITEM 20. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

     Section 317 of the California Corporations Code authorizes a court to
award, or a corporation's Board of Directors to grant, indemnity to directors
and officers in terms sufficiently broad to permit indemnification, including
reimbursement of expenses incurred, under certain circumstances for liabilities
arising under the Securities Act. Cisco's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as
amended, and Amended Bylaws provide for indemnification of its directors,
officers, employees and other agents to the maximum extent permitted by the
California Corporations Code. In addition, Cisco has entered into
indemnification agreements with each of its directors and officers.

ITEM 22. UNDERTAKINGS.

     The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:

     1. That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities
        Act, each filing of the Registrant's annual report pursuant to Section
        13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
        amended (the "Exchange Act") (and, where applicable, each filing of an
        employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the
        Exchange Act), that is incorporated by reference in this Registration
        Statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to
        the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at
        that time shall be deemed to be a bona fide offering thereof;

     2. That, prior to any public reoffering of the securities registered
        hereunder through use of a prospectus which is a part of this
        Registration Statement, by any person or party who is deemed to be an
        underwriter within the meaning of Rule 145(c) of the Securities Act,
        such reoffering prospectus will contain the information called for by
        the applicable registration form with respect to reofferings by persons
        who may be deemed underwriters, in addition to the information called
        for by the other items of the applicable form;

     3. That every prospectus (i) that is filed pursuant to paragraph (2)
        immediately preceding, or (ii) that purports to meet the requirements of
        Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act and is used in connection with an
        offering of securities subject to Rule 415, will be filed as a part of
        an amendment to this Registration Statement and will not be used until
        such amendment is effective, and that, for purposes of determining any
        liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment
        shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the
        securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that
        time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof;

     4. To respond to requests for information that is incorporated by reference
        into the prospectus pursuant to Item 4, 10(b), 11 or 13 of Form S-4,
        within one business day of receipt of such request, and to send the
        incorporated documents by first class mail or other equally prompt
        means. This includes information contained in documents filed subsequent
        to the effective date of this Registration Statement through the date of
        responding to the request; and

     5. To supply by means of a post-effective amendment all information
        concerning a transaction, and the company being acquired involved
        therein, that was not the subject of and included in this Registration
        Statement when it became effective.

     Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
Registrant pursuant to the provisions described under Item 20 above, or
otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event
that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
                                      II-2
<PAGE>   185

(other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer
or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the
Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as
expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication
of such issue.

Registrant has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its
behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of San Jose,
State of California, on this 19th day of May.
