Section 1.3 _Construction_.

 

(a) Any reference in this Agreement to an "Article," "Section," "Exhibit"
or "Schedule" refers to the corresponding Article, Section, Exhibit or
Schedule of or to this Agreement, unless the context indicates otherwise. The
table of contents and the headings of Articles and Sections are provided for
convenience only and are not intended to affect the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement. All words used in this Agreement are to be
construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances require. The
words "including," "includes" or "include" are to be read as listing non-
exclusive examples

 



13

    

 of the matters referred to, whether or not words such as "without
limitation" or "but not limited to" are used in each instance. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends, and such phrase will not mean simply "if." The term "or"
will not be deemed to be exclusive. The phrase "made available to"
means disclosures posted in the electronic data room named "Project Silver"
three Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Where this Agreement states that
a party "shall," "will" or "must" perform in some manner or otherwise act or
omit to act, it means that the party is legally obligated to do so in
accordance with this Agreement. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter,"
"hereof," "hereunder" and "hereto" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
merely to a subdivision in which such words appear unless the context
otherwise requires. Any reference to a statute is deemed also to refer to any
amendments or successor legislation as in effect at the relevant time. Any
reference to a Contract or other document as of a given date means the
Contract or other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to
time through such date. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
monetary values stated herein are expressed in United States currency and all
references to "dollars" or "$" will be deemed references to the United States
dollar. Where a monetary threshold stated in _Article 5_ or _Section_ __ _
7.2_ is expressed in United States dollars, the threshold amount will where
applicable be deemed to specify an equivalent amount of non-United States
currency, determined based on the applicable currency exchange rate determined
as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) If and to the extent any information required to be furnished in any
Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule is contained in this Agreement or
in any other Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule such information shall
be deemed to be included in all Sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule in
which the information would otherwise be required to be included to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure is
applicable to such other Section. Disclosure of any fact or item in any
Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be considered an
admission by the disclosing party that such item or fact (or any non-
disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance)
represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such
item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, or that such item or fact will in fact exceed any applicable threshold
limitation set forth in the Agreement and shall not be construed as an
admission by the disclosing party of any non-compliance with, or violation
of, any third party rights (including but not limited to any Intellectual
Property rights) or any applicable Law, such disclosures having been made
solely for the purposes of creating exceptions to the representations and
warranties made herein or of disclosing any information required to be
disclosed under the Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the
information and disclosures contained therein are intended only to qualify
and limit the representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement, and do not, except as expressly set forth in the representations
and warranties (or covenants) which they qualify, constitute representations
and warranties (or covenants) as to the matters described therein. Neither
the Sellers, the Company, nor the Purchaser shall be prejudiced in any manner
whatsoever, and no presumptions shall be created, by virtue of the disclosure
of any matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule which otherwise is not
required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

ARTICLE 2 

THE TRANSACTION

 Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale of Transferred Equity Securities_. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing, the Sellers will sell and transfer to the Purchaser, and
the Purchaser will purchase and acquire from the Sellers, the Transferred
Equity Securities, free and clear of all Encumbrances, in exchange for the
payment of the Purchase Price to the Sellers (subject to adjustment pursuant
to Section 2.2)

 



14

    

Section 2.2 _Determination of Purchase Price_.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, on the
Closing Date, the Sellers will be entitled to receive aggregate consideration
in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Purchase Price_ ")
equal to the sum of (i) $655,000,000.00, _plus_ (ii) the Estimated
Closing Cash Amount (which may be a negative number), _plus_ (iii) the
Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (which may be a negative
number), _minus_ (iv) the Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount, _minus_ (v)
the Estimated Transaction Expenses, _minus_ (vi) the Estimated Closing Income
Taxes.

(b) No later than three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, the Sellers will prepare and deliver to the Purchaser an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies prepared on an estimated
basis as of 11:59 p.m. local time in each applicable jurisdiction on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_
"), with a statement that will set forth the SellersÂ’ good faith, reasonable
estimate of each of the Closing Cash Amount (the " _Estimated Closing Cash
Amount_ "), the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ "), the Closing Indebtedness Amount (which
shall be equal to or greater than the Payoff Amount) (the " _Estimated
Closing Indebtedness Amount_ "), the Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated
Transaction Expenses_ ") and the Closing Income Taxes (the " _Estimated
Closing Income Taxes_ "), and the Purchase Price determined based on the
foregoing amounts (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "), in each case
determined based on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and prepared in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(g)_.

(c) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will prepare and
deliver to the Sellers a written notice (the " _Adjustment Notice_ ")
containing an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies
as of 11:59 p.m. local time in each applicable jurisdiction on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ")
together with the PurchaserÂ’s calculation of (i) the Closing Cash Amount, the
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Closing Indebtedness Amount, the
Transaction Expenses and the Closing Income Taxes, and (ii) the Purchase
Price determined based on the foregoing amounts (the " _Final Purchase Price_
"). The Closing Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with  _Section_
__ _ 2.2(g)_.

(d) If the Purchaser fails to timely deliver the Adjustment Notice,
then the Estimated Purchase Price will be deemed to be the Final Purchase
Price and will be conclusive and binding on the parties.

 

(e) Within 30 days after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, the Sellers
will either:

 

(i) agree in writing with the Adjustment Notice, in which case the
calculation of the Final Purchase Price set forth in the Adjustment Notice
will be final and binding on the parties; or

(ii) dispute the Adjustment Notice by delivering to the Purchaser a
written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for each such disputed item, including its calculation of each disputed
item.

 

If the Sellers fail to take either of the foregoing actions within 30 days
after delivery of the Adjustment Notice, then the Sellers will be deemed to
have irrevocably accepted the Adjustment Notice, in which case the
calculation of the Final Purchase Price set forth in the Adjustment Notice
will be final and binding on the parties. If the Sellers timely deliver a
Dispute Notice to the Purchaser, then the Sellers and the Purchaser will
attempt in good faith, for a period of 30 days, to agree on the Final Purchase
Price. Any resolution by the Sellers and the Purchaser during such 30-day
period as to any disputed items will be final and binding on the parties. If
the Sellers and the Purchaser do not resolve all disputed items by the end of
the 30-day period after the date of delivery of the Dispute Notice (the "
_Negotiation Period_ "), then the Sellers and the Purchaser will submit to
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, or if Deloitte

 



15

    

 Touche Tohmatsu Limited is unavailable or unwilling to serve, another firm
mutually agreed upon by the parties (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") the items
remaining in dispute that were properly included in the Dispute Notice (the "
_Unresolved Items_ "); provided that if the Purchaser and the Sellers are
unable to agree upon such firm within 10 days after the end of the Negotiation
Period, then the Accounting Firm shall be an accounting or valuation firm of
national standing appointed by the American Arbitration Association in New
York, New York (provided that such firm shall not be the independent auditor
of (or otherwise provide services under a contractual arrangement with)
either the Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) or the Sellers (or any of
their Affiliates). The Sellers and the Purchaser will instruct the Accounting
Firm to render its determination in a written report that specifies
the conclusions of the Accounting Firm as to each Unresolved Item and the
resulting calculation of the Final Purchase Price, in each case based solely
on the written reports submitted to the Accounting Firm by the Sellers and the
Purchaser and oral submissions by the Sellers and the Purchaser at meetings
held in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_ (i.e., not on independent
review) and on the definitions and other terms included herein; _provided_ ,
that in resolving an Unresolved Item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a
value to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party, in the written reports presented to the Accounting Firm. The
Sellers and the Purchaser will each use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the Accounting Firm to render its determination within 30 days after referral
of the items to such firm or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable.
The resolution of the Unresolved Items by the Accounting Firm will be final
and binding, and the determination of the Accounting Firm will constitute an
arbitral award that is final, binding and nonappealable and upon which
a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction over the party
against which such determination is to be enforced. The parties will revise
the Closing Balance Sheet and the amounts included in the Adjustment Notice as
appropriate to reflect the resolution of the items in dispute pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will
be shared by the Purchaser and the Sellers in inverse proportion to the
relative amounts of the Unresolved Items determined to be for the account of
the Purchaser and the Sellers, respectively. For example, if the Sellers
submit a Dispute Notice for $1,000, the Purchaser contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by the Sellers, and the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves
the dispute by awarding the Sellers $300 of the contested amount, then the
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e.,
300/500) to the Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Sellers). 

(f) For purposes of complying with this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, the Purchaser
and the Sellers will furnish to each other and to the Accounting Firm such
work papers and other documents and information relating to the disputed items
as the Accounting Firm may request and are available to that party (or its
independent public accountants) and will be afforded the opportunity to
present to the Accounting Firm any material related to the disputed items and
to discuss the items with the Accounting Firm; ___provided_ that (i) each
party will provide the other party with a copy of all materials provided to,
and communications with, the Accounting Firm, and (ii) no party (or any of its
Affiliates or representatives) will engage in any _ex parte_ communication
with the Accounting Firm at any time with respect to the Unresolved Items.

(g) The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Balance Sheet and any
estimates, determinations and calculations contained therein or based thereon
will be prepared and calculated on a consolidated basis for the Acquired
Companies in accordance with the Accounting Rules, except that such estimates,
determinations and calculations (i) will not include any purchase accounting
or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) will be based on facts and circumstances
as they exist immediately prior to the Closing and will exclude the effect of
any act, decision or event occurring on or after the Closing, (iii) will
follow the defined terms contained in this Agreement and the Accounting Rules
regardless of whether such terms or the Accounting Rules are consistent with
GAAP, and (iv) will be set forth in United States dollars after any applicable
portion thereof denominated in a currency other than United States dollars has
been converted to United States dollars at the foreign exchange reference
rate with respect to such currency set forth in _Schedule 1.1(a)_.

 



16

    

(h) Within five Business Days following the determination of the Final
Purchase Price in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_:

(i) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then the Sellers will pay, or cause to be paid, to the Purchaser an amount
equal to the absolute amount of such difference first by causing such amount
to be distributed to the Purchaser from the Adjustment Escrow Fund and, if
the absolute amount of such difference exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount,
paying to the Purchaser the amount of such excess. The foregoing payments
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts specified by the Purchaser at least five Business Days prior to
the payment.

(ii) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase
Price, then the Purchaser will pay to the Sellers an aggregate amount equal to
such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts specified by the Sellers at least two Business Days prior to the
payment.

(iii) If there is any amount remaining in the Escrow Adjustment Account
after the payment of amounts in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Purchaser shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay such amounts to the Sellers in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement.

 

Any amount paid with respect to final adjustments to the Purchase Price made
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ will be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the
receiving party. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ will
be treated by the parties for all purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price and will not be subject to offset for any reason.

 

Section 2.3 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein
to the contrary, the Purchaser is permitted to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or
under any applicable provision of Tax Law. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
amounts will be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. In
the event the Purchaser determines that an amount is required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to any amount payable or otherwise deliverable under
this Agreement (excluding any amount required to be withheld as a result of
the failure to deliver the applicable FIRPTA Certificate), then the Purchaser
will notify the Sellers at least 20 Business Days prior to the date the
applicable payment is scheduled to be made (which notification will include a
copy of the calculation of the amount expected to be deducted and withheld) so
that the Sellers have a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or other
evidence that would exempt such amounts from deduction and withholding, and
the Purchaser will cooperate with the Sellers to secure any applicable
exemptions or reductions to withholding Taxes, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

 

Section 2.4 _Tax Treatment and Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) Within 120 days after the final determination of the Purchase Price
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, the Purchaser will prepare and deliver to
the Sellers a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (together with other
relevant amounts, including Liabilities deemed assumed for U.S. federal income
tax purposes), among the Dutch Parent Company and the U.S. Parent Company
(and further among the assets

 



17

    

 held by the Dutch Parent Company) based on an estimate of the fair market
values of the Acquired Companies in accordance with applicable Tax Law
(together, the " _Estimated Allocation_ "). If the Sellers do not deliver
within 30 days after receipt of the Estimated Allocation a written notice
setting forth in reasonable detail any revisions to the Estimated Allocation
proposed by the Sellers (an " _Allocation Notice_ "), the Estimated
Allocation will be deemed the "Final Allocation" for all purposes hereunder.
Prior to the end of such 30-day period, the Sellers may accept the Estimated
Allocation by delivering written notice to that effect to the Purchaser, in
which case the Estimated Allocation will be deemed the "Final Allocation" for
all purposes hereunder when such notice is given. If the Sellers deliver
an Allocation Notice within such 30-day period, the Purchaser and Sellers
will negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute within 45 days after the
delivery of the Estimated Allocation. If the Purchaser and the Sellers
resolve all such disputes concerning the Estimated Allocation within 45 days
after its delivery, the Estimated Allocation, as amended to reflect such
resolution, shall become binding upon the Purchaser and the Sellers and will
be the " _Final Allocation_." If the Purchaser and the Sellers cannot agree
on the Final Allocation within 45 days after delivery of the Estimated
Allocation, all then remaining disputed items shall be submitted for
resolution by an independent appraisal firm mutually selected by the
Purchaser and the Sellers. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall each request
that the independent appraisal firm make a final determination as to the
disputed items within 30 days after such submission. The Estimated Allocation
shall be amended in accordance with the findings of such independent appraisal
firm, and the Estimated Allocation, as so amended, shall become binding upon
the Purchaser and the Sellers and shall be the Final Allocation. The fees,
costs, and expenses of the independent appraisal firm shall be borne equally
by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand.

 

(b) The Final Allocation shall be amended (with the mutual agreement of
the parties) to reflect any adjustments to the Purchase Price under this
Agreement and any other adjustments mutually agreed to between the Purchaser
and the Sellers.

 

(c) Each of the Sellers and the Purchaser will prepare and file, and cause
their respective Affiliates to prepare and file, their Tax Returns (including
Internal Revenue Service Forms 8594 and 8883, if applicable) on a basis
consistent with the Final Allocation. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, none of the Sellers, the Purchaser or their respective Affiliates
will take any position inconsistent with the Final Allocation in any U.S.
federal or state Tax Return, in any U.S. federal or state Tax refund claim, in
any U.S. federal or state Proceeding or otherwise unless required by a
final determination by an applicable Governmental Authority. If any party, or
any Affiliate of any party, receives notice from any Governmental Authority
that such Governmental Authority is disputing the Final Allocation, such party
will promptly notify the other parties, and the Sellers and the Purchaser
agree to use their reasonable best efforts to defend such Final Allocation in
any Proceeding, and the dispute shall be governed by the procedures in
_Section_ __ _ 11.2_.

 

ARTICLE 3

Section __ 5.4 _Capitalization and Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) _Section 5.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth for
each Acquired Company (i) its name and jurisdiction of organization and (ii)
the number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other Equity
Securities and the record holders thereof. The Transferred Equity Securities
constitute the only issued and outstanding shares of equity interests of the
Company. No Acquired Company owns or has any rights to acquire, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock or other Equity Securities of any Person, except
for the Subsidiaries set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. All of the issued and outstanding Equity Securities of
each Acquired Company have been duly authorized and are validly issued, owned
of record by, and only by, one or more of the Acquired Companies and, in the
case of shares of capital stock, are fully paid and nonassessable and free of
any Encumbrances.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_ and other than this
Agreement, there are no (i) Equity Securities of any class of any Acquired
Company, or any security exchangeable into or exercisable for such Equity
Securities, issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding or (ii)
subscriptions, options, warrants, equity securities, calls, rights or other
Contracts to which any Acquired Company is a party or by which any Acquired
Company is bound obligating any Acquired Company to issue, exchange, sell,
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, or cause to be issued, exchanged,
sold, purchased, redeemed or acquired, Equity Securities of any Acquired
Company or any security or rights convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any such Equity Securities. Other than this Agreement, there
are no Contracts to which any Acquired Company is a party or by which any
Acquired Company is bound with respect to the transfer, voting (including
voting trusts or proxies), registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
" _Securities Act_ ") or any state securities Law of the Equity Securities of
any Acquired Company. No holder of Indebtedness of any Acquired Company has
any right to convert or exchange such Indebtedness for any Equity Securities
of any Acquired Company. No holders of outstanding Indebtedness of any
Acquired Company have any rights to vote for the election of directors or
managers (or similar member of any governing body) of any Acquired Company.

 



24

    

(c) Neither the Company nor any of the other Acquired Companies has any
unsatisfied liability or obligation to pay any dividend or other distribution
in respect of any of the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ capital stock (and no Acquired
Company has accrued or declared, but unpaid, dividends or other distributions
or obligations to make any payments in respect of any Acquired CompanyÂ’s
capital stock).

Section 5.5 _Financial Statements_. __

(a) Attached as  _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
are the following financial statements:

 

(i) an audited consolidated balance sheet of all Acquired Companies as of
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, and the related audited consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in partnersÂ’
capital and cash flows for the year then ended, including in each case the
notes thereto, together with the report thereon of PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, independent certified public accountants (together, the " _Audited
Financial Statements_ ");

 

(ii) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as
of September 30, 2018 (the " _Interim Balance Sheet_ ") and the related
unaudited consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year-
to-date period then ended (together with the Audited Financial Statements,
the " _Financial Statements_ ").

(b) Except as provided or described in the Financial Statements, the
Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects the financial
condition and results of operations of the applicable Acquired Companies on a
consolidated basis as of the respective dates thereof and for the periods
indicated therein. The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistent with past practice and applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except that the unaudited interim financial
statements are subject to normal year-end adjustments that would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Acquired Companies on a
consolidated basis and do not contain all footnotes or other presentation
items as required by GAAP). The Acquired CompaniesÂ’ system of internal
controls over financial reporting is sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of the Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP, consistently applied.
Since December 31, 2015, no officer, director, or employee of any Acquired
Company has refused to execute any certification of any nature whatsoever
required by Law or requested by any accounting, banking, financial, or legal
firm or entity, and there have been no internal or external investigations
regarding illegal or fraudulent financial reporting or accounting policies and
practices at or with respect to any Acquired Company discussed with or
initiated by any executive officer or director of any Acquired Company or the
Sellers or that have been disclosed to the auditors of any Acquired Company or
the Sellers.

 

Section 5.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. No Acquired Company has any
material Liabilities as of the date of this Agreement that would be required

reflected, reserved against or otherwise disclosed in the Financial
Statements (including the notes thereto), (b) arising in the ordinary course
of business after the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, (c) incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (d)
disclosed in _Section 5.6_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



25

    

Section 5.7 _Absence of Certain Changes and Events_. Since the date of
the Interim Balance Sheet, there has not been any Material Adverse Effect.
Since the date of the Interim Balance Sheet through the date of this
Agreement, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, the Acquired
Companies have operated their business in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business. Since the date of the Interim Balance Sheet and
through the date of this Agreement, the Company and the other
Acquired Companies have not taken any action that, if taken during the period
from the date of this Agreement through the Closing without the PurchaserÂ’s
consent, would constitute a breach of any provision of _Section 7.2(b)_.

 

Section 5.8 _Real Property_. _Section 5.8_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete description as of the date of
this Agreement of (a) __ all real property owned by any Acquired Company (the

Company leases or subleases the Leased Real Property, including all
amendments, modifications, supplements, extensions, renewals and guaranties

Property and do not cover or apply to any other real property) which have been
provided to the Acquired Companies by the applicable taxing authorities prior
to the date of this Agreement for taxable periods ending during 2018 and 2017.
The Acquired Companies have good and marketable fee simple title to (or
regarding real properties in the Netherlands, hold a valid ground lease
interest " _recht van erfpacht_ " in) each Owned Real Property and a good and
valid leasehold interest in each Leased Real Property, free and clear of any
Encumbrances. No Acquired Company is in default under any Lease, no Acquired
Company has received any written notice of default under any Lease that has
not been fully cured, and, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, no counterparty to any
Lease is in default thereunder. There are no leases, subleases, licenses or
other agreements granting to any Person other than the Acquired Companies any
right to the possession, use, occupancy or enjoyment of the Owned Real
Property or Leased Real Property or any portion thereof, and the Acquired
Companies enjoy peaceful, undisturbed and exclusive possession of the Real
Property. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Proceedings pending
nor, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, threatened, against or affecting the Real

the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Leases have been amended,
modified, supplemented, replaced, terminated or cancelled, and each Lease is
valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), is in full force and effect, and is the
complete and only agreement relating to the applicable Acquired CompanyÂ’s use
and occupancy of the applicable Leased Real Property. All leasing commissions
or other brokerage fees due from or payable by the Acquired Companies with
respect to the Real Property have been paid in full. Since March __ 1, 2012,
no special assessments have been levied against any portion of the Owned Real
Property, and, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, no such special assessments are
contemplated or pending. Except as set forth on _Section 5.8_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no casualty events have occurred at or with respect
to the Real Property in the past three years. The Real Property constitutes
all of the real property and interests in real property that is necessary to

conducted and operated. All 

 



26

    

 buildings, improvements and fixtures located on the Real Property are
structurally safe and sound, fit for their intended purposes, and in good
working order and condition. The Real Property is in compliance with all
applicable Laws, including zoning Laws, in all material respects. There are no

which would affect any portion of the Real Property. All of the Real Property

clear of all Encumbrances.

 

(b) None of the activities or business presently conducted by any Acquired
Company or an Acquired CompanyÂ’s present use of the Owned Intellectual
Property infringes or violates, or constitutes a misappropriation of, and in
the past three years has not infringed or violated, or constituted a
misappropriation of, any Intellectual Property rights of any Person. Except
as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.10(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Acquired Companies have not received from any Person in the past six years
(or earlier for matters that are still unresolved) any written allegation
that any of the Owned Intellectual Property or the operation of the business
of the Acquired Companies is infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise
violating the Intellectual Property rights of any Person.

 

(c) To the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, no other Person is infringing, violating or

and manufacturing processes for products being produced by the Acquired

 



27

    

 Companies as of the date of this Agreement which documentation is current,
accurate, and sufficient in detail and content to identify and explain the
formulation and production of the products. In each case in which an Acquired
Company has acquired any of the Owned Intellectual Property through or from
any current or former employee, consultant, independent contractor or other
Person, including any Owned Intellectual Property developed by such Person on
behalf of or at the direction of an Acquired Company, the relevant Acquired
Company has obtained a valid and enforceable written assignment agreement
sufficient to transfer all rights, title and interest in that Intellectual
Property to the Acquired Companies to the extent any such rights did not
become the sole property of the Acquired Companies by operation of Law.

 

(f) All software used internally by the Acquired Companies is owned by an

storage and disposal of personal information collected, used, or held for use
by the Acquired Companies in the conduct of their business. No claim, action
or proceeding has been asserted or threatened in a writing received by any of
the Acquired Companies since March 1, 2012 alleging a violation of any
PersonÂ’s rights of publicity or privacy or personal information or
data rights, and to the Knowledge of the Company, and assuming the compliance
of the Purchaser and, after the Closing, the Company, with all applicable
Laws, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
materially breach or otherwise cause any violation of any Laws or rule,

Binder Agreement, will (a) __ conflict with or violate the Constituent
Documents of the Purchaser, (b) __ result in a breach or default under or
create in any Person the right to terminate, cancel, accelerate or modify, or

Guarantor. The Guaranty is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against it in

reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the parties to obtain, on a
timely basis, any authorization, consent, order, declaration or approval of

condition to be satisfied by it contained in the Binder Agreement. The Binder

with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or approval

or any expiration of any applicable waiting period or extension thereof under
any applicable Competition Laws (which actions will include furnishing
all information required under the HSR Act and any other applicable
Competition Laws) and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement.
Additionally, the parties will each use their respective reasonable best
efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to this Agreement and will not
take any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any
Governmental Authorization or permission, approval or consent from any third
party required to be obtained prior to the Closing.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the parties will keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all
required consents, authorizations, orders or approvals of, or any exemptions
by, any Governmental Authorities, any expiration of any applicable waiting
period or extension thereof, or any Governmental Authorizations required under
any applicable Competition Laws. In this regard, prior to the Closing, each
party will promptly consult with the other parties to provide any
necessary information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence,

such party with any Governmental Authority or any other information supplied
by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
will promptly inform the other parties, and if in writing, furnish the other
parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the

shall prevent the Sellers or the Company from providing information to a
Governmental Authority with respect to the Sellers or the Company. If any
party or any representative of such party receives a request for information
or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will use its
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after
consultation with the other parties, a response in compliance with such
request that permits the requesting Governmental Authority to proceed with
its review of the transaction. No party will participate in any meeting with
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by

such outside counsel and / or corporate in-house counsel with responsibility
for antitrust or regulatory matters to the directors, officers or employees
(other than corporate in-house counsel with responsibility for antitrust and
regulatory matters if permitted) of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the source of the materials or its legal counsel;
_provided_ that materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_
may be redacted by the producing party to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Acquired Companies, as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and as necessary to address reasonable privilege considerations.

 

(c) The Sellers shall prepare and withdraw, or cause their Affiliates to
prepare and withdraw, for any Dutch Acquired Company that no longer satisfies

additional information or documentary materials after an initial notification
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Competition Law (a " _Second Request_

(a) The Cayman Seller and the Purchaser agree to continue to abide by the
Confidentiality Agreement between the Cayman Seller and the Guarantor dated
April 24, 2018 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will survive until

Agreements, (v) in connection with its indemnification obligations under this
Agreement, including the defense of any Third Party Claim or (vi) in
connection with the SellersÂ’ investigation and pursuit of the Assigned Claims
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Support
Agreement; _provided_ , that in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii), the Sellers shall promptly notify the Purchaser (to the extent legally
permissible) in advance of such disclosure so that the Purchaser may seek, at
the PurchaserÂ’s sole expense (and the Sellers will commercially
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in seeking) a protective order or other
appropriate remedy in lieu of or with respect to such disclosure and/or waive
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.5(b)_, and to the extent legally
permissible, the Sellers will attempt to obtain, at the PurchaserÂ’s sole
expense, reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to

Section 7.6 _Public Announcements_. Each party agrees not to issue any
press release or make any other public announcement relating to this
Agreement without the prior written approval of the other parties (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless required by
applicable securities Law or securities listing standards. The other parties
will have the right to review and make reasonable comments upon such press
release or other announcement prior to its issuance, distribution or
publication, which comments the issuing party shall consider in good faith;
_provided_ , that the foregoing will not restrict or prohibit the Sellers or
the Acquired Companies from making any announcement to any Affiliates of the
Sellers or investors, co-investors in any Affiliate of the Sellers. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Purchaser (or any of its
Affiliates) may file this Agreement, including a summary thereof, with the

Section 7.7 _Exculpation and Indemnification_. 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Purchaser will cause the Acquired
Companies to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations to their
respective current and former directors, managers, officers and employees (and
any individual who prior to the Closing Date becomes a director, manager,
officer or employee of an Acquired Company) pursuant to any indemnification
provisions under the Constituent Documents of the Acquired Companies as in
effect on the date of this Agreement (the Persons entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to such provisions being referred to collectively as the "
_Affiliate Indemnified Parties_ "). From and after the Closing through the
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the Purchaser will cause the Acquired
Companies to maintain the provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses from Liability as set forth in the
Constituent Documents of the Acquired Companies as of the date of this
Agreement, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified during such period in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Affiliate Indemnified Party, except as required by
applicable Law.

 

(b) For at least six years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will cause
the Acquired Companies to maintain in effect policies of directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance of at least the same level of coverage and
containing terms which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the
insured as the current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance maintained by the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date, in each
case with respect to Liabilities arising out of or relating to events which
occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and covering those Affiliate
Indemnified Parties who are covered by the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance policy of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser will not be required to
expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Acquired Companies for such insurance, but in the event
that the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Purchaser will, or will cause its

 



49

    

 Affiliates to, obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount. The Purchaser may satisfy its obligations
under this _Section 7.7(b)_ by purchasing a single tail directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance policy, covering, for a period beginning on the
Closing Date and continuing for at least six years thereafter covering each
Affiliate Indemnified Party for whom insurance coverage is required to be
provided pursuant to this _Section 7.7(b)_ with at least the same coverage
and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous
to the Affiliate Indemnified Parties than those currently provided to the
Affiliate Indemnified Parties under the insurance policies maintained by the
Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date.

 

(c) This _Section 7.7_ will survive the Closing, is intended to benefit
and may be enforced by the Acquired Companies and their Affiliate Indemnified
Parties, and will be binding on all successors and permitted assigns of the
Purchaser.

connection with the arrangement, marketing, negotiation and execution of the
Financing, (iv) delivering to the Purchaser, no later than four Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, any materials and documentation about the Acquired
Companies required under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money

ACT) Act of 2001), to the extent requested by the Purchaser no less than 15
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (v) providing customary
authorization letters to the PurchaserÂ’s financing sources, authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors, and (vi)
using reasonable efforts to cause their independent auditors to cooperate
with the Financing (including by providing customary consents and comfort

officer employee or other Affiliate of the Acquired Companies will be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee, provide any security, execute any
document, make any representations, provide any indemnification or incur any
other Liability in connection with the Financing that is effective prior to
the Closing, (x) the effectiveness of any documentation executed by any of the
Acquired Companies (and the obligation of such Persons to pay any fees)
with respect to the Financing will be subject to the consummation of the
Closing, (y) the Purchaser will promptly, upon request by the Company,
reimburse and indemnify the Company for all costs or Liabilities incurred by
the Acquired Companies in connection with the cooperation contemplated by
this _Section 7.8_ (other than to the extent such costs or Liabilities arise
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct by any of the Acquired
Companies) and (z) none of the Acquired Companies, or any Persons who are
directors of an Acquired Company, will be required to pass resolutions or
consents to approve or authorize the execution of the debt financing or
execute or deliver any certificate, document, 

 



50

    

 instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing or agree to
any change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument
or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing. Any information provided
to the Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ will be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 7.5; _except that any
such information may be disclosed (i) to prospective lenders, underwriters,
initial purchasers, placement agents, dealer managers, solicitation agents,
information agents and depositary or other agents during syndication and
marketing of the Financing that enter into confidentiality arrangements
customary for financing transactions of the same type as such Financing
(including customary "click-through" confidentiality undertakings) and (ii) on
a confidential basis to rating agencies. The Sellers and the Company, on
behalf of themselves and the Acquired Companies, hereby consent to the
reasonable use of the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ trademarks, service marks and logos
solely in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that such trademarks,
service marks and logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to

Affiliates or the reputation or goodwill of the Acquired Companies. The
Purchaser shall obtain the prior written consent of the Company before the
intended use.

Section 7.9 _Preservation of Records_. From and after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser will, and will cause the Acquired Companies to, preserve and
keep the records relating to the businesses of the Acquired Companies in
accordance with the PurchaserÂ’s normal document retention procedures for a
minimum of seven years and will make such records available to the Sellers or
their respective Affiliates (at the SellersÂ’ expense) pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)_.

 

Section 7.10 _Credit and Performance Support Obligations_. The Purchaser
(or one of its Affiliates) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) to be absolutely and unconditionally relieved on or prior to the
Closing Date of all Liabilities arising out of the letters of credit,
performance bonds, corporate guarantees and other similar items issued and
outstanding on behalf of the Acquired Companies, and set forth on _Schedule
7.10_ (collectively, the " _Guarantees_ "). In the event that, as of the
Closing Date, Sellers and their respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) shall not have been relieved from any Liability in respect of the
Guarantees, the Purchaser will (a) indemnify the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) against any Losses of any kind
whatsoever with respect to such Guarantees and (b) use its commercially
reasonable efforts after the Closing to relieve the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) of any Liabilities.

Section 7.16 _Interim Casualty Events_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if, prior to the Closing, any portion of the
Acquired CompaniesÂ’ assets suffers any damage, destruction or other casualty
losses that individually or in the aggregate do not have an estimated repair
cost (including the cost of any remediation necessary to restore the affected
assets to the condition prior to such casualty) as reasonably determined by
Sellers which constitutes a Major Loss, then, subject to the satisfaction of
all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the Purchaser set forth
in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_, the Purchaser shall complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in which case all proceeds of any
insurance or compensation will be payable to the Purchaser, and all rights
and claim of the Sellers to any such amounts not used for repair by the

prior to the Closing), the Purchaser shall reimburse Seller out of insurance
proceeds received by the Company or the Purchaser after the Closing for all
amounts in excess of the applicable deductibles on the CompanyÂ’s casualty
insurance policies, expended by the Company to remediate the insurable
damage, destruction or other casualty losses prior to the Closing for which
the Company did not receive insurance proceeds prior to the Closing. Any claim

Section 7.23 _Pre-Closing Restructuring_.

Dutch Tax authorities that the conversion will not result in a taxable
transaction. Save for actions that cannot be delayed, prior to effecting the
actions contemplated under sub-Sections (i) and (ii) of this _Section_ __ _
7.23(a)_, the Sellers shall provide the Purchaser with copies of any draft
agreements, resolutions, filings or other material documents relating to
actions contemplated under sub-Sections (i) and (ii) of this  _Section_ __ _
7.23(a)_ and shall consider in good faith the views of the Purchaser with
respect to such drafts and the restructuring and related actions.

 

(b) If a Dutch Acquired Company is required to install a supervisory board,
the Sellers shall in close consultation with the Purchaser (i) install only
one supervisory board consisting of five (5) members, four of whom will resign
at Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)(ii)_, (ii) appoint all
persons designated by the Purchaser, where required upon the nomination by
the supervisory board, as new supervisory directors as of Closing in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)(ii)_, (iii) ensure that the Constituent

or  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_, provided the Sellers have acted in good faith, in
no event will the Sellers be required to indemnify the Purchaser or Acquired
Companies for any Loss associated with any actions taken by the Sellers or
any Acquired Company in connection with this _Section_ __ _ 7.23_ or the
failure by the Sellers to complete the restructuring contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.23_.

ARTICLE 9

 

TERMINATION

 Section 9.1 _Termination Events_. This Agreement may, by written notice
given before or at the Closing, be terminated:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Sellers;

 

(b) by the Purchaser (so long as the Purchaser is not then in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement as would cause any of the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ not to be satisfied) if
there has been a breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the Sellers or the Company contained in this Agreement which
would result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, and which breach cannot be cured by the
Company or the Sellers, as applicable, by August 12, 2019 (the " _Outside
Date_ "), or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within the
earlier of (i) the Outside Date, or (ii) 30 days after written notice of the
breach has been delivered to the Sellers by the Purchaser;

 

(c) by the Sellers (so long as the Sellers and the Company are not then in
material breach of any of their respective representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement as would cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ not to be satisfied) if there has been a breach of any
of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement which would result in the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, and which breach cannot be cured by the Purchaser by
the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured
within the earlier of (i) the Outside Date or (ii) 30 days after written
notice of the breach has been delivered to the Purchaser by the Sellers;

 

(d) by either the Purchaser or the Sellers, if any Governmental Authority
has issued a nonappealable final Judgment or taken any other nonappealable
final action, in each case having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining, making illegal or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_ will not be available to any
party whose material breach of this Agreement has been the primary cause of or
resulted in the action or event described in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_
occurring;

(e) by the Purchaser, if the Closing has not occurred (other than if the
failure of the Purchaser to comply fully with its obligations under this
Agreement is the primary cause of the failure of the Closing Date to occur on
or before such date) on or before the Outside Date; or

 



57

    

(f) by the Sellers, if the Closing has not occurred (other than if the
failure of the Sellers or the Company to comply fully with their respective
obligations under this Agreement is the primary cause of the failure of the
Closing Date to occur on or before such date) on or before the Outside Date.

 

Notwithstanding _Section 9.1(e)_ or _Section 9.1(f)_, if as of the Outside
Date all of the conditions precedent to obligations of the Purchaser set
forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_, other than the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.1(b)_ (to the extent related to any
Competition Law) and those conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied at the Closing have been satisfied, the Purchaser and the Sellers
will each have the right, exercisable by delivery of written notice to the
other party at least five Business Days prior to the then existing Outside
Date, to extend the Outside Date by 90 additional days. Following the exercise
of such right by the Purchaser or Sellers, all references to the Outside Date
in this Agreement will refer to such extended Outside Date,  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, absent the mutual agreement of the parties, the Outside Date
may only be extended three times.

 Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 9.1_, this Agreement and all rights and obligations of
the parties under this Agreement will automatically end without Liability
against any party or its Affiliates, except that (a) _Section 7.5(a)_,
_Section 7.6_, this _Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3_, and _Article 13_ (except
for _Section 13.10_) will remain in full force and survive any termination
of this Agreement and (b) no such termination shall relieve any party from any
liability for damages resulting from an intentional and material breach of
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "intentional and material
breach" means a material breach of this Agreement that is the consequence of
an act or failure to act undertaken by the breaching party with actual
knowledge that the taking of or failure to take such act would, or would be
reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.3 _Reverse Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated (a) by the Purchaser
pursuant to  _Section 9.1(e)_, (b) by the Sellers pursuant to _Section
9.1(f)_, or (c) by the Sellers or the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_
(but only if the applicable Judgment or other nonappleable final action
relates to a Competition Law), and (ii) on the date of such termination all of
the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ shall
have been satisfied or waived, other than (x) the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.1(a)_, (y) the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_ (but only
if the applicable Proceeding, Law or Judgment relates to a Competition Law)
and (z) those conditions that are by their nature to be satisfied at the
Closing (but, in the case of clause (z), which conditions would be satisfied
if the Closing Date were the date of such termination), then the Purchaser
shall promptly pay to the Sellers the Reverse Termination Fee by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
the Sellers to the Purchaser for such purpose (it being understood that in no
event shall the Purchaser be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on
more than one occasion).

(b) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that without these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Purchaser fails to promptly pay the
amounts due pursuant to this  _Section 9.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Sellers commence a suit that results in a judgment against the
Purchaser for any amounts due pursuant to this _Section 9.3_, the Purchaser
shall pay to the Sellers their out-of-pocket, documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the
publicly announced prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. from the date such fee,
cost or expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date.

 



58

    

(c) The parties acknowledge that the Reverse Termination Fee shall not
constitute a penalty but constitutes liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the Sellers in the circumstances in which the
Reverse Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event the Sellers receive the Reverse Termination Fee from the Purchaser
pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 9.3_, such payment shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Sellers, the Seller GP and the Company
and their respective Affiliates against the Purchaser, its Affiliates and any
of their respective former, current, or future stockholders, directors,
officers, Affiliates or agents for any Losses suffered as a result of any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the
Purchaser in this Agreement or in any certificate or other document delivered
in connection herewith (other than in connection with any intentional and
material breach of this Agreement as described in _Section 9.2_) or the
failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated, or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement, and upon payment of such amount
if and when due, none of the Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their
respective former, current, or future stockholders, directors, officers,
Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
other than the obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement and the Clean
Room Agreements (the " _Clean Team Agreements_ ") among the Cayman Seller, the
Guarantor and GuarantorÂ’s Advisors (as defined in such Clean Room Agreements).

 

ARTICLE 10

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 Section 10.1 _Indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties_.
From and after the Closing Date, subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 10.4_ and _Section 10.5_, the Sellers shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates, including for this purpose the
Acquired Companies, and their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, consultants, advisors and representatives (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses (other
than Losses with respect to Taxes, for which the provisions of _Section
11.1(a)_ will govern) of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising
or resulting from (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of (i) the
Sellers set forth in _Article 4_ , (ii) the Company set forth in _Article 5_
or (iii) in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement (in
each case, except in the case of _Section 5.5_ and the first sentence of
_Section 5.7_, read without regard to all references to "material", "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar qualifications as to materiality set forth
therein) or (b)  any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Sellers or
the Company set forth in this Agreement.

Section 10.2   _Indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Parties_. From
and after the Closing Date, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
10.4_ and _Section 10.5_, the Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors or representatives
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and
all Losses (other than Losses with respect to Taxes, for which the provisions
of _Section 11.1(b)_ will govern) of the Seller Indemnified Parties arising
or resulting from (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser set forth in  _Article 6_ , or (b) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement.

 



59

    

Section 10.3 _Claim Procedure_. 

(a) A party that seeks indemnity under this _Article 10_ (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") will give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from
whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") whether the
Losses sought arise from matters solely between the parties or from a claim or
Proceeding by another Person not a party, nor an Affiliate of a party, to
this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ "). The Claim Notice must contain (i)
a description and, if known, the estimated amount of any Losses incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a
reasonable explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent of the
facts then known by the Indemnified Party and (iii) a demand for payment of
those Losses;  _provided_ that no delay or deficiency on the part of the
Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article 10_ except to the
extent such delay or deficiency materially prejudices the rights of the
Indemnifying Party with respect thereto.

(b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be
entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, assume
control of the defense thereof at its sole cost and expense with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party by giving to the Indemnified
Party written notice of its intention to assume control of the defense of such
Third Party Claim within ten days of receipt of notice of such Third Party
Claim. Following the assumption of control of the defense of any Third Party
Claim by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party may participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim (unless the Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party, as applicable, agrees otherwise in writing) in the event:
(i) the Third Party Claim involves an injunction or other equitable relief;
or (ii) losses sought to be recovered under such Third Party Claim (together
with all other losses sought to be recovered under any other claims then
pending or in dispute) would reasonably be expected not to be covered by the
Indemnifying Party under the limitations on indemnification set forth in
_Section 10.5_.

(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party declines to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim within 30 days of receiving a Claim Notice,
or is not entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim according
to subsection (b) above, then the Indemnified Party will have the right to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its choosing
(which reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall constitute
recoverable Losses for which the Sellers or the Purchaser, as applicable,
is responsible if the claim underlying such Third Party Claim is a claim for
which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder);
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more
than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel). If the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance
with this subsection (c), then:

 

(i) The Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party informed of all
material developments relating to such Third Party Claim. The Sellers or the
Purchaser, as applicable, shall have the right to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to such Third Party Claim
to the extent that receipt of such documents does not waive any privilege;

(ii) The Indemnifying Party may retain separate co-counsel and participate
in the defense of such Third Party Claim or settlement negotiations with
respect to such Third Party Claim at its own cost and expense, and shall be
entitled to reasonably consult with the Indemnified Party with respect to
the defense of such Third Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect
to such Third Party Claim; and

(iii) The Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being

 



60

    

 understood that it shall be reasonable to withhold such consent where the
Sellers or the Purchaser, as applicable, believes in good faith that there is
not an underlying basis for indemnification with respect to such
settlement)), unless (1) such judgment, settlement or compromise includes an
unconditional release from all Liability with respect to the claim in favor of
the Purchaser Indemnified Party or the Seller Indemnified Party,
as applicable, or (2) the Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party stipulates in writing that there are no Losses for which it is entitled
to indemnification under this _Article 10_ in connection with such judgment,
settlement or compromise.

(d) In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not agree to any settlement of, or
consent to the entry of any Judgment (other than a Judgment of dismissal on
the merits without costs or Liability and which includes no admission of fault
or wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates) arising from any
such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_,
the Purchaser will not be required to provide a Claim Notice to the Sellers,
permit the Sellers to assume the defense of or obtain the SellersÂ’ consent in
connection with the settlement of any claim for indemnification by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties that is to be satisfied exclusively through a
claim made by the Purchaser under the RandW Insurance Policy.

 

Section 10.4 _Survival_. All representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement will survive the Closing until the later of (i) the first
anniversary of the Closing Date or (ii) __ March __ 31 of the calendar year
after the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, unless on or prior to
such date a proper Claim Notice is made with respect to any such
representation or warranty, in which case such representation or warranty
shall survive until, but only for the purposes of, the resolution of such
claim; provided that the Seller Fundamental Representations shall survive the
Closing until the date that is the ten year anniversary of the Closing Date,
unless on or prior to such date a proper Claim Notice is made with respect to
any such representation or warranty, in which case such representation or
warranty shall survive until, but only for the purposes of, the resolution of
such claim. All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement required
to be performed or complied with, in whole or in part, after the Closing Date
will survive the Closing until the earlier of the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations and the last date on which each such post Closing
covenant or agreement was required to be performed as specified in this
Agreement. All claims for indemnification under this Agreement must be
asserted pursuant to a Claim Notice given prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth in this _Section 10.4_; _provided_ that
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is the subject of a
claim for indemnification which is asserted pursuant to a Claim Notice given
after the Closing Date within the survival periods specified in this _Section
10.4 _will survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of such
claim.

 

Section __ 10.5 _Limitations on Liability_.

 

(a) Any indemnification to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may be
entitled pursuant to this _Article 10_  or _Article 11_ will be satisfied
exclusively by payment from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or by claims made by the
Purchaser under the RandW Insurance Policies, except the Sellers shall remain
responsible for all indemnifiable Losses arising out of, relating to or
incurred by reason of (i) Seller Fraud, (ii) breach of covenants that by their
respective terms anticipate performance following the Closing Date, or (iii)
any breach of the Seller Fundamental Representations (in each case, to the
extent the Losses associated with such claim are not paid under the RandW
Insurance Policies).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 



61

    

(i) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will not be entitled
to indemnification with respect to any individual claim or series of claims
having the same nature or origin where the Losses relating thereto are less
than $200,000, and then the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification with respect to the full amount of such claim, it being
understood that such items less than $200,000 will not be aggregated for
purposes of calculating the Deductible in clause (ii) below; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the limitation set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.5(b)(i)_
shall not apply in the case of Seller Fraud, breach of a covenant or
agreement, to any indemnification obligation of the Sellers arising out of or
resulting from, any breach of the Seller Fundamental Representations or to an
indemnification claim under _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ for Excluded Taxes;

 

(ii) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to
indemnification until the aggregate amount of Losses to which the Purchaser
Indemnified Party would (but for this clause (ii)) be entitled exceeds
$3,275,000.00 (such amount being the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the
extent of such excess over the Deductible; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Deductible shall not apply in the case of Seller Fraud, breach a covenant or
agreement, to any indemnification obligation of the Sellers arising out of or
resulting from, any breach of the Seller Fundamental Representations or to an
indemnification claim under _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ for Excluded Taxes;

(iii) other than any indemnification obligation of the Sellers arising out
of or resulting from, any breach of the Seller Fundamental Representations,
breach of a covenant or agreement or Seller Fraud, the aggregate amount with
respect to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will be entitled to
indemnification by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement will not exceed the
Indemnity Escrow Amount. The aggregate amount with respect to which the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties will be entitled to indemnification by the
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement in respect of inaccuracies in or breaches
of Seller Fundamental Representations shall not exceed the Final Purchase
Price; and

 

(iv) the right to indemnification or any other remedy based on
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall
not be affected by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance
of or compliance with any such covenant or agreements, will not affect the
right to indemnification or any other remedy based on such representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements.

 

(c) In addition to the limitations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.5_,
with respect to any claim for indemnification by a Purchaser Indemnified
Party under this _ARTICLE 10_ regarding any breach of any representation and
warranty set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ (Environmental Matters), the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to indemnification for any
Loss to the extent such Loss arises out of or as a result of: (i) any
voluntary notice or disclosure by any Purchaser Indemnified Party to any
Governmental Authority or third party of any Release of Hazardous Material or
any other environmental conditions or matters at the Real Property, (ii) the
performance at the Real Property of any environmental sampling or testing,
including a Phase II environmental investigation, by or on behalf of any
Purchaser Indemnified Party after the Closing Date, unless, in the case of (i)
or (ii), such notices or actions are (A) required by applicable Law, an order
from a Governmental Authority or to respond to a third party claim initiated
by any Governmental Authority or third party, (B) required to address
subsurface conditions identified in connection with any construction,
development, demolition or renovation activities undertaken by the Acquired
Companies or (C) undertaken to address an imminent and substantial
endangerment to human health or the environment discovered in the ordinary
course of business; or (iii) any change from the current industrial use of the
Real Property after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case,
the Sellers and its Affiliates shall have no Liability for any such Loss to
the extent that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, or any other Person after
Closing, contribute to or exacerbate the condition or circumstance forming
the basis of such Loss.

 



62

    

(d) The amount of any Losses (which shall take into account any reasonably
anticipated offsetting net Tax benefits or detriments, if any) for which
indemnification is provided pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ 10_ or _Article
11_ will be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party
under any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments
or reimbursements receivable by, or payable in kind to, the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Losses less any related deductibles, out of pocket fees
and expenses, or amounts paid, incurred or suffered by such Indemnified Party
in connection with recovering such amount. In connection therewith, if, at any
time following any indemnification payment pursuant to this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments,
contribution payments or reimbursements relating to the circumstances giving
rise to such indemnification payment, except to the extent of any Losses not
covered by such proceeds, payments or reimbursements, the Indemnified Party
will promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party such proceeds, payments or
reimbursements in an amount not to exceed the amount of the corresponding
indemnification payment made by the Indemnifying Party. The Purchaser will
use (and will cause its Affiliates to use) reasonable best efforts to collect
the proceeds of any available insurance and other available sources of
indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements that would
have the effect of reducing any Losses (in which case the net proceeds thereof
will reduce the Losses).

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any amounts
payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this _Article_ _10_
will be paid without duplication and in no event will any party hereto be
indemnified under different provisions of this Agreement for Losses that have
already been paid or otherwise taken into account under this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser or the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties will not make any claim for indemnification
under this _Article_ _10_ to the extent the amount of such Loss is taken into
account as a Current Liability or other reduction in the calculation of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.2_; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not limit any Purchaser
Indemnified PartyÂ’s right to indemnification under this _Article_ _10_ with
respect to any Losses indemnifiable under this _Article_ _10_ in excess of
what was reflected in such adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(f) The Indemnified Party will use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate
any Losses (other than those for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party has
recourse against any RandW Insurance Policy pursuant to the terms thereof) with
respect to which it may be entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement. This provision shall not however require the Indemnified Party to
mitigate Losses once all amounts in the Indemnity Escrow Fund have been paid
out to the Purchaser or Seller in accordance with the terms thereof.

 

(g) In no event will Indemnified Party be entitled to recover for any
Losses for general and administrative time or other overhead expenses that
are not paid to a third party. Purchaser Indemnified Persons will have no
right to make a claim for any Loss to the extent it is primarily a possible or
potential Loss that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties believe may be asserted
rather than a Loss that has, in fact, been paid or incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither any
revocation, cancellation or modification of any RandW Insurance Policy, nor any
inability of, nor any denial by, the RandW Insurer to pay any Losses
contemplated by any RandW Insurance Policy, shall result in Liability under this
_Article 10_ to the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates which is in
excess of the Liability of the Sellers contemplated under this _Article 10_.

 



63

    

(i) For purposes of calculating the amount of any Losses arising from any
breach of any representation or warranty subject to indemnification hereunder,
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement will be read
without regard to all references to "material", "Material Adverse Effect" or
similar qualifications as to materiality set forth herein.

 

Section 10.6 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Each of the
parties agrees to treat any payments under this _Article 10_ or _Article 11_
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Tax Law.

 

Section 10.7 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, except as otherwise provided in (i) _
Section_ __ _ 13.10_ ( _Specific Performance_ ), (ii) in the case of Seller
Fraud, or (iii) in the case of covenants or agreements that by their
respective terms anticipate performance following the Closing Date, and
subject to any rights of the Purchaser under the RandW Insurance Policies, the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any matter
arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this  _Article 10_ or
_Article 11_ and, except to the extent the Purchaser has asserted a claim for
indemnification by giving a Claim Notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _
10.3_ prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 10.4_, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will have no remedy
for any breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, except as otherwise provided in (i) _
Section_ __ _ 13.10_ ( _Specific Performance_ ), (ii) in the case of fraud,
or (iii) in the case of covenants or agreements that by their respective terms
anticipate performance following the Closing Date, the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Seller Indemnified Parties for any matter arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article 10_ or _Article 11_ and,
except to the extent the Sellers have asserted a claim for indemnification by
giving a Claim Notice in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section_ __ _
10.4_, the Seller Indemnified Parties will have no remedy for any breach of
any provision of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 10.7_ will not
interfere with or impede the operation of the provisions of _Section_ __ _
2.2_ providing for the resolution of certain disputes relating to the Purchase
Price between the parties or by the Accounting Firm. Nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the liability of the Sellers to the Purchaser for actual
fraud in the event that the Sellers, Seller GP or the Company is finally
determined by a court of competent and final jurisdiction to have willfully
and knowingly committed fraud against the Purchaser, with the specific intent
to deceive and mislead the Purchaser, regarding the representations and
warranties made in this Agreement (" _Seller Fraud_ "). The exception to the
limit of Sellers liability shall not include (i) constructive fraud, (ii)
fraud related to the operation of the Company and not related to the making of
representations and warranties under this Agreement or (iii)  claims of
fraud against Persons other than the Sellers, Seller GP or the Company or any
of their respective employees.

 ARTICLE 11

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 11.1 _Liability and Indemnification for Taxes_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, subject to the limitations set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 11.1(d)_, the Sellers will indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for all Excluded Taxes.

 



64

    

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will indemnify
the Seller Indemnified Parties against all Taxes of the Acquired Companies
that are attributable to any Post-Closing Period and any Taxes for which an
amount has been, and to the extent, included in Closing Income Taxes, other
than any such Tax liabilities that are Excluded Taxes.

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Purchaser will elect
(and will cause the Acquired Companies to elect) to treat any Straddle Period
with respect to any Tax of the Acquired Companies as ending as of the end of
the Closing Date, and will take such steps as may be necessary therefor. If
such an election cannot be made, for purposes of this Agreement, all Taxes
and Tax Liabilities with respect to the income, property or operations of the
Acquired Companies that relate to a Straddle Period will be apportioned
between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period (i) in the case of
Taxes other than income, sales and use, turnover, wage, and withholding Taxes,
on a per-diem basis, and (ii) in the case of income, sales and use, turnover,
wage, and withholding Taxes, as determined from the books and records of the
Acquired Companies as though the taxable year of the Acquired Companies
terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, if any Transaction Tax Deduction is reflected on a Straddle Tax Return
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)_, such Transaction Tax Deduction shall be
apportioned to the Pre-Closing Period.

(d) Any indemnification to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may be
entitled pursuant to this _Article 11_ will be satisfied exclusively by
payment from the Indemnity Escrow Fund (and subject to any rights of the
Purchaser under the RandW Insurance Policies), and no claim (for
indemnification or otherwise) relating to Taxes may be asserted by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party against the Sellers or any other Seller
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to indemnification for
(i) reductions in any Tax Attributes (other than any Tax Attributes taken into
account in calculating Closing Income Taxes or Closing Net Working Capital) of
any Acquired Company, (ii) Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Periods to the
extent such Taxes are reduced by Pre-Closing Period Tax Attributes, (iii)
Taxes that were taken into account in calculating the Closing Net Working
Capital or the Closing Income Taxes, (iv) Indirect Taxes that are reasonably
recoverable (as determined in good faith by the Purchaser taking into account
the burden and expense of such recovery) from a Person other than the
Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or the Seller, (v) Taxes resulting from
transactions or actions taken by any Purchaser Indemnified Party or the
Acquired Companies after the Closing Date, or (vi) Taxes directly attributable
to and resulting from any extraordinary transactions or actions taken by the
Purchaser or Acquired Companies outside of the ordinary course of business
that occur on the Closing Date after the Closing except to the extent that, in
the case of each of clauses (v) and (vi), such transactions or actions are
(y) expressly contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that any
actions taken in connection with making any Section 338(g) Election and
actions taken pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ are expressly contemplated
by this Agreement) or (z) required to be taken by an Acquired Company to
comply by applicable Law.

 

(e) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and
charges (including any penalties and interest), in each case, imposed on the
purchase and sale of the Transferred Equity Securities pursuant to this
Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, not including any income or capital
gains Tax of the Sellers or their direct or indirect owners) (" _Transfer
Taxes_ ") will be paid by the Purchaser when due. The Purchaser will, at its
own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law,
the parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to join in the execution of
any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

Section __ 11.2 _Tax Returns; Tax Proceedings_. __

(a) The Sellers shall, at their expense, prepare and timely file, or cause
to be prepared and timely filed (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained), all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the Acquired
Companies for any Pre-Closing Period (other than a Straddle Period). With
respect to any such Tax Returns that are due after the Closing Date and prior
to the Escrow Survival Date (each, a " _Pre-Closing Tax Return_"), the Sellers
will remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Pre-
Closing Tax Returns. Drafts of any Pre-Closing Tax Return will be submitted by
the Sellers to the Purchaser not later than 45 days prior to the due date for
filing such Pre-Closing Tax Return (taking into account any applicable
extensions) for review and reasonable comment by the Purchaser. Any Pre-
Closing Tax Returns prepared by the Sellers pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.2(a)_ will (x) be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of the
relevant Acquired Company, unless otherwise required pursuant to applicable
Law and (y) to the extent permitted under applicable Law and not inconsistent
with clause (x), reflect any relevant Transaction Tax Deductions. Within 20
days after the date that the Purchaser receives such draft Pre-Closing Tax
Return, but in no event less than five days prior to the due date of any such
Pre-Closing Tax Return, the Purchaser will advise the Sellers in writing that
it either agrees with the draft Pre-Closing Tax Return or does not agree with
the draft Pre-Closing Tax Return, in which case, the Purchaser shall set out,
in reasonable detail, the basis for such disagreement, and the Purchaser and
the Sellers will discuss in good faith to resolve the disagreement. In the
event the Purchaser and the Sellers fail to reach agreement, the Purchaser and
the Sellers agree to mutually instruct an independent accounting firm to make
a final determination of all matters that remain in dispute in respect of such
draft Pre-Closing Tax Return. The fees and expenses of such independent
accounting firm will be borne equally by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Sellers, on the other hand. __

 

(b) The Purchaser will prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed (taking into account all extensions properly obtained), all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by the Acquired Companies after the
Closing Date that include a Straddle Period (each, a " _Straddle Tax Return_
"). Subject to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(c)_ of this Agreement,
the Purchaser will remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of
such Straddle Tax Returns. With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed
by the Purchaser pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)_, (the " _Covered
Returns_ "), drafts of such Covered Returns will be submitted by the Purchaser
to the Sellers not later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing such
Covered Returns (taking into account any applicable extensions), _provided_
that such due date is at least 45 days following the Closing Date for review
and reasonable comment by the Sellers. Any Straddle Tax Returns prepared by
the Purchaser pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)_ will (x) be prepared
in a manner consistent with past practice of the relevant Acquired Company,
unless otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law and (y) to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, reflect any relevant Transaction Tax
Deductions. Within 30 days after the date that the Sellers receive such draft
Covered Return, but in no event less than five days prior to the due date of
any such Covered Return, the Sellers will advise the Purchaser in writing
that it either agrees with the draft Covered Return or does not agree with the
draft Covered Return, in which case, the Sellers shall set out, in reasonable
detail, the basis for such disagreement, and the Sellers and the Purchaser
will discuss in good faith to resolve the disagreement. In the event the
Sellers and the Purchaser fail to reach agreement, the Sellers and the
Purchaser agree to mutually instruct an independent accounting firm to make a
final determination of all matters that remain in dispute in respect of such
draft Covered Return. The fees and expenses of such independent accounting
firm will be borne equally by the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser,
on the other hand. The Purchaser will timely file, or cause to be filed, all
Covered Returns, which will be amended, if necessary, after the final
resolution of the disputed items by the independent accounting firm pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)_. Without limiting the PurchaserÂ’s or any
other PersonÂ’s rights to indemnification under this _Article 11_ or _Article_
_10_ , the Purchaser will pay (or cause to be paid) the Taxes shown as due
thereon. Within 10 days of the PurchaserÂ’s filing of a Covered Return, the
Sellers will reimburse the Purchaser for the amount of Taxes on such Covered
Return that is attributable to a Pre-

 



66

    

 Closing Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Purchaser fails to
timely comply with its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)_,
the Purchaser and not the Sellers will be responsible for (and the Purchaser
will indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers for) any Tax-related Losses,
including any interest, additions to Tax, or penalties, incurred by
the Sellers or any of their Affiliates solely and exclusively as a
consequence of the PurchaserÂ’s failure to timely comply with the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)_. on any Straddle Tax Return, _provided_ that,
no later than 5 days prior to the due date for paying such Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority, the Sellers will pay to (or as directed by)
the Purchaser the amount of Excluded Taxes due in respect of such Straddle Tax
Return.

 

(c) If, after the Closing Date and prior to the Escrow Survival Date, the
Purchaser or an Acquired Company receives in writing any communication from
any Governmental Authority with respect to any pending or threatened Tax
Proceeding in connection with any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies for a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period, the Purchaser will
promptly notify the Sellers of such Tax Proceeding following receipt;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no failure or delay by the Purchaser to provide
such notice shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligation of the Sellers
under _Section_ __ _ 11.1(a)_, except and only to the extent that the Sellers
are materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. The Purchaser will include
with such notification a true, correct and complete copy of such written
communication so received by the Purchaser or an Acquired Company. Until the
Escrow Survival Date, the Sellers will have the right to control any Tax
Proceeding that is with respect to a Pre-Closing Period of the Acquired
Companies (other than a Straddle Period or a Tax Proceeding with respect to a
Tax for which the Purchaser is responsible pursuant to _Section_ __ _
11.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.1(e)_) (a " _Sellers_ _Â’_ _Tax Proceeding_ ");
_provided_ that (i) the Sellers will keep the Purchaser reasonably informed
concerning the progress of any such SellersÂ’ Tax Proceeding, (ii) the Sellers
will provide the Purchaser copies of all correspondence and other documents
relevant to any such SellersÂ’ Tax Proceeding, (iii) the Sellers shall conduct
such SellersÂ’ Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith, and (iv) the
Sellers will not agree to settle such SellersÂ’ Tax Proceeding without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(d) The Purchaser will have the right to control any Tax Proceeding that is
with respect to a Straddle Period of the Acquired Companies (a " _Purchaser
Â’s Tax Proceeding_"); _provided_ __ that, prior to the Escrow Survival Date,
(i) the Purchaser will keep the Sellers reasonably informed concerning the
progress of any such PurchaserÂ’s Tax Proceeding, (ii) the Purchaser will
provide the Sellers copies of all correspondence and other documents relevant
to any such PurchaserÂ’s Tax Proceeding, (iii) the Purchaser shall conduct such
PurchaserÂ’s Tax Proceeding diligently and in good faith, and (iv) the
Purchaser will not agree to settle a Tax Proceeding without the prior written
consent of the Sellers, which the Sellers shall not unreasonably withhold,
condition, or delay. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Purchaser shall
exclusively control all Tax Proceedings with respect to any of the Acquired
Companies. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser
shall have the exclusive right to control any (x) SellersÂ’ Tax Proceeding
that the Sellers elect not to control within 30 days after receipt of notice
of such Tax Proceeding and (y) Tax Proceeding with respect to any of the
Acquired Companies after the Escrow Survival Date.

 

Section __ 11.3 _Administration of Tax Claims and
Survival_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any claims for
any and all Tax matters shall be made only pursuant to, and the procedures
with respect thereto shall be governed exclusively by, this _Article 11_ and
shall not be governed by the provisions of _Article 10_ ; provided, however,
that _Section 10.4_, _Section 10.5(a)_, _Section 10.5(b)(iv)_, _Section
10.6_, and _Section 10.7_ will apply in the case of any claim related
to Taxes pursuant to this _Article 11_. The obligation to indemnify and hold
harmless pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)_ and _Section 11.1(b)_ shall survive
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby until the
Escrow Survival Date.

 



67

     

Section __ 11.4 _Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and the Sellers will cooperate in
good faith, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
including providing information and data required in order to enable the
parties to complete and file Tax Returns pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ and
to respond to audits by any Governmental Authority and to otherwise enable
the parties to satisfy their internal accounting, Tax and other reasonable
requirements. Such cooperation and information will include (upon the other
partyÂ’s request) promptly forwarding copies of appropriate notices and forms
of other communications received from or sent to any Governmental Authority
which relate to Taxes of any of the Acquired Companies for which such party is
liable and providing copies of the relevant portion of Tax Returns for which
such party is liable, together with accompanying schedules and related work
papers, documents relating to rulings or other determinations by any

record retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority.

 

Section 11.5 _Transaction Tax Deductions_. For the avoidance of doubt,
the parties acknowledge and agree that any Transaction Tax Deductions will be
for the benefit of Seller and will be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Period of
the Acquired Companies for purposes of determining the amount of any Tax for
which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)_ and will be
reported on the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ Tax Returns for taxable years that end on
or include the Closing Date.

 

Section __ 11.6 _Post-Closing Taxes Matters_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise required by Law, and until the Escrow Survival Date,
the Purchaser will not, without the prior written consent of the Sellers
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed),

Companies for any Pre-Closing Period (other than any Straddle Period).

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Purchaser will be
solely responsible for all Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Acquired
Companies, or for which the Acquired Companies may otherwise be liable, for
any Post-Closing Period (other than any Straddle Period).

Agreement to the contrary, the Sellers shall terminate (or cause to be
terminated) on or before the Closing Date all Tax sharing, allocation,
indemnity or similar agreements or arrangements (other than this Agreement),
if any, to which any Acquired Company, on the one hand, and the Sellers or any
of their respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) or direct
or indirect owners, on the other hand, are parties, and none of the
Purchaser, the Acquired Companies, or any of their respective Affiliates or
direct or indirect owners shall have any obligations thereunder after the
Closing.

338(g) Election_"). The Sellers and the Purchaser (a) __ shall not, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, undertake any action or engage
in any transaction that would jeopardize the validity of any Section __
338(g) Election, (b) __ agree to report the transfers under this Agreement
consistent with any Section __ 338(g) Election and

 



68

ARTICLE 12

 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 Section 12.1 _Employees_.

(a) For a period of one year commencing on the Closing Date (or such
longer period as may be required by any collective bargaining, works council
or similar agreement (to the extent then applicable) or applicable Law) (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), the Purchaser will provide, or cause the Acquired
Companies to provide, those Persons employed by any Acquired Company
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Transferred Employees_ "), for so
long as each Transferred Employee remains employed by Purchaser or
an Affiliate thereof (including an Acquired Company) during the Continuation
Period, with (i) base salary or hourly wages which are no less than the base
salary or hourly wages provided by the Acquired Companies immediately prior to
the Closing, (ii) target bonus opportunities which are no less than the
target bonus opportunities provided by the Acquired Companies immediately
prior to the Closing, and (iii) employee benefits (including severance
benefits, but excluding retiree welfare benefits) that in the aggregate are
substantially equivalent to those provided to such Transferred Employees
immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(b) To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility,
vesting or benefit accrual under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement established or maintained by the Purchaser for the benefit of
Transferred Employees, such plan, program or arrangement will credit such
employees or former employees for service on or prior to the Closing with the
Acquired Companies and their Affiliates, to the same extent such service was
recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company
Plan in which such Transferred Employee was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, the foregoing shall
not apply with respect to (i) benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan or retiree welfare benefit program, (ii) to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service, or (iii) with respect to any plan, program, or
arrangement (A) that is grandfathered or frozen, or (B) with respect to which
similarly situated employees of Purchaser do not receive prior service
credit.

(c) After the Closing Date, the Purchaser will assume or cause
the Acquired Companies to perform in accordance with their terms (including

collective bargaining, works council or similar agreements to which an
Acquired Company is party as of the Closing.

(d) The Acquired Companies shall submit any communications with any
current or former employees or service providers of the Acquired Companies
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, employee
benefits, post-Closing terms of employment or otherwise to the Purchaser for
review, comment and approval prior to distribution of such communications, and
the Purchaser agrees that its review, comment and approval of such
communications shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Transferred Employee or
other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of the
Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or any Affiliate of the Purchaser, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Purchaser, the

  



69

    

 Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Transferred
Employee at any time following the Closing for any reason whatsoever. In no
event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or
modify any Company Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program or Contract maintained or
sponsored by the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies) or
Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the
Acquired Companies) or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company
Plan or any other compensation or benefit or employment plan, program or
Contract after the Closing. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this _Article 12_ shall create any third party

exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or remedy.

Section 13.5 _Assignment, Successors and No Third Party Rights_. This
Agreement binds and benefits the parties and their respective heirs,
successors and assigns, except that no party may assign this Agreement or any
rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties. No
party may delegate any performance of its obligations or assign any of its
rights under this Agreement, except that the Purchaser may at any time
delegate the performance of its obligations or assign any of its rights to
any Affiliate of the Purchaser so long as the Purchaser remains fully
responsible for the performance of the delegated obligation. Any assignment in
violation of this _Section 13.5_ will be null and void _ab initio_. Except
for the indemnification and other obligations set forth in _Section 7.7_,
which are intended for the benefit of and may be enforced by the Affiliate
Indemnified Parties, no provision of this Agreement is intended or will be
construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement
and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns any right, remedy
or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section __ 13.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement
is held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of
this Agreement remain in full force and effect, if the essential terms and
conditions of this Agreement for each party remain valid, binding and
enforceable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 13.7 _Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and Schedules to
this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections and
paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and paragraphs
of _Article 5_. The disclosure in any section or paragraph of the Company
Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to relate to each corresponding section or
paragraph of Article 5 and any other section to which the applicability of
such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face.

Section 13.8 _Interpretation_. In the negotiation of this Agreement, each
party has received advice from its own legal counsel. The language used in
this Agreement is the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual
intent, and no provision of this Agreement will be interpreted for or against
any party because that party or its legal counsel drafted the provision.

 

Section 13.9 _Expenses_. The Purchaser will be responsible for the
payment of the Policy Premium and any other costs and expenses relating to
the RandW Insurance Policies. Except as set forth in this Agreement, whether or
not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, each
party will pay its own direct and indirect expenses incurred by it in
connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all
fees and expenses of its advisors and representatives.

Section 13.10 _Specific Performance_. __

 

(a) Each party acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this Agreement
would give rise to immediate, extensive and irreparable harm for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any
breach or threatened breach by the Sellers or the Company on the one hand, or
the Purchaser, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Sellers or the Company, on the
one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, in addition to any other right
or remedy 

 



73

    

 that such party may be entitled at Law or equity, will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy or otherwise. Each party further
acknowledges and agrees that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 13.10_ will not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction. To
the extent all conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement contained in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_
and _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ have been satisfied or waived and any party brings
any Proceeding, before any Governmental Authority to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement prior to the
Closing, the Outside Date will automatically be extended by (a) the amount of
time during which such Proceeding is pending, plus 30 Business Days, or (b)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such
Proceeding. The Sellers and the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchaser,
on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the Company or
the Sellers, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations on remedies of
the Sellers following termination of this Agreement set forth in _Section_ __
_ 9.3_ shall not limit the right of the Sellers to obtain specific
performance pursuant to, and subject to the limitations of, this _Section_ __
_ 13.10_.

 

Section 13.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT WILL, AND ALL CLAIMS OR CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, IN TORT, AT LAW OR OTHERWISE) THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF
OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE REGISTRATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF
THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR AS AN INDUCEMENT TO ENTER THIS AGREEMENT) BE DEEMED TO BE
MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS WILL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT
REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF INCLUDING ITS STATUTES OF
LIMITATIONS.

(b) All Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be
heard and determined in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York located in the City of New York, New York (or, if the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York located in
the City of New York, New York declines to accept jurisdiction over any
Proceeding, in the New York State Court located in the City of New York,
Borough of Manhattan, New York) and the parties hereby irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such Proceeding
and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack of
jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such Proceeding. The consents to
jurisdiction and venue set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 13.11(b)_ will not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of New York and
will have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this paragraph and
will not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties.
Each party agrees that service of process upon such Person, as applicable, in
any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be effective
if notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth in _Section_
__ _ 13.1_. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such Proceeding
will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in 

 



74

    

 any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in the foregoing will restrict any partyÂ’s rights to seek any post-
judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

Section 13.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT IN NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION AND DELIVERY, PERFORMANCE OR
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 

Section 13.13 _Limitation on Liability_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO
EVENT WILL ANY PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXEMPLARY OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM, LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY ARISING
OUT OF THE CONDUCT OF SUCH PARTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER THE NONPERFORMING PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES; _PROVIDED_ THAT THE FOREGOING SHALL NOT LIMIT A PERSONÂ’S ABILITY TO
RECOVER ANY SUCH LOSSES ACTUALLY PAID TO A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A
THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

Section 13.14 _Waiver of Conflicts of Interest; Legal Privileges_.

(a) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Baker and McKenzie LLP
(including all affiliated firms and individual lawyers at such firms, " _Baker
McKenzie_ ") has prior to the date of this Agreement represented the Acquired
Companies, and received confidential information of the Acquired Companies,
in connection with various matters, including with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In connection with any negotiation, dispute or
other Proceeding that may arise concurrently or in the future with respect
to this Agreement, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Baker McKenzie
may represent the Sellers and any other Seller Indemnified Party in connection
with such matter, and the Purchaser, following consultation with counsel other
than Baker McKenzie and full disclosure of all facts material to this
conflict waiver, expressly waives any and all rights to assert any claim of
conflict of interest on the part of Baker McKenzie with respect to any such
matter or that Baker McKenzie is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation. In addition, the Purchaser on behalf of itself and all other
Purchaser Indemnified Parties acknowledges and agrees that, effective as of
the Closing, all rights with respect to all attorney-client privilege, work
product, professional confidentiality and other similar privileges and
protections arising solely with respect to Baker McKenzieÂ’s representation of
the Acquired Companies, the Sellers or any other Seller Indemnified Party in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any
related auction sale process) and not with respect to any other advice
provided to the Acquired Companies, the primary purpose of which was not
to facilitate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will be deemed
to have been assigned to, and will become the sole property of, the Sellers
and that the Sellers, on behalf of the Seller Indemnified Parties, will have
the exclusive right to control all decisions with respect to the assertion or
waiver of such privileges and protections. This advance conflict waiver will
apply whether or not Baker McKenzie represents the Sellers in any matter
following the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between the Acquired Companies and a third party after the
Closing, the Acquired Companies may assert the attorney-client privilege with
respect to any potentially privileged matters to the extent not adverse to
the interests of the Sellers.

 



75

    

(b) Furthermore, notwithstanding this Agreement, the Acquired Companies
and the Purchaser agree that neither the Acquired Companies nor the Purchaser
shall have the right to control, assert or access the attorney/client
privilege as to any communications at any time between the Sellers or the
Acquired Companies (for the Acquired Companies, only with respect to
communications at or prior to the Closing) and Baker McKenzie to the extent
that the privileged communications relate to this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The parties agree that following the Closing, the Seller, and no one else,
shall be entitled to control, access and assert such attorney/client privilege
as to such communications.

 

(c) The Sellers and the Purchaser agree that, prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to remove from Acquired
CompaniesÂ’ files and records, including electronic records and email,
attorney-client privileged communications relating to the Agreement or any of
the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
or any efforts to sell the Acquired Companies to the Purchaser or any other
Person. The files generated and maintained by Baker McKenzie in connection
with representation of the Sellers and the Acquired Companies in
connection with this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any efforts to sell the
Acquired Companies to the Purchaser or any other Person, but not files
relating to any other advice provided to the Acquired Companies, the primary
purpose of which was not to facilitate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall be and become the exclusive property of the Sellers subject
to applicable Laws of any regulatory authority to which Baker McKenzie is
subject.

(d) The Purchaser acknowledge that it has consulted with counsel other than
Baker McKenzie regarding the foregoing consents and waivers, that the
consents and waivers are voluntary, have been considered carefully and that
the consents and waivers are the result of fully-informed consent.

 

Section 13.15 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim or cause of action that may be based upon, in respect
of, arise under, out of or by reason of, be connected with or relate in any
manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, performance or
breach, of this Agreement, including, any representation or warranty made or
alleged to have been made in, in connection with or as an inducement to, this
Agreement (each of such above-described legal, equitable or other theories or
sources of liability, a " _Recourse Theory_ ") may only be made or asserted
against (and are expressly limited to) the Persons that are expressly named
parties and signatories to this Agreement and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No Person
who is not a party and signatory hereto (including, (a) any former, current or
future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling Person, management
company, incorporator, member, partner, manager, director, officer, employee,
agent, Affiliate, assignee, attorney or other representative of, and any
financial advisor or lender to (all above-described Persons in this sub-clause
(a), collectively, " _Affiliated Persons_ ") a party hereto or any Affiliate
of such party, and (b) any Affiliated Persons of such Affiliated Persons (the
Persons in sub-clauses (a) __ and (b), together with their respective
successors, assigns, heirs, executors or administrators, collectively,
but specifically excluding the parties hereto, " _Non-Parties_ ")) will have
any liability (whether in contract, in tort, at law or otherwise) whatsoever
in respect of, based upon or arising out of any Recourse Theory under this
Agreement. Without limiting the rights of any party hereto against the other
parties hereto as set forth herein, in no event will any party hereto, any of
its Affiliates or any Person claiming by, through or on behalf of any of them
institute any claim or cause of action under any Recourse Theory against any
Non-Party. The provisions of this _Section 13.15_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and enforceable by, the Non-Parties.

 

Section __ 13.16 _Rights Cumulative_. Except as otherwise
expressly limited by this Agreement, all rights and remedies of each of the
parties under this Agreement will be cumulative, and the exercise of one or
more rights or remedies will not preclude the exercise of any other right or
remedy available under this Agreement or applicable Law.

 



76

     

Section 13.17 _Counterparts_. The parties may execute this Agreement
in multiple counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against
the party that signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement.
This Agreement is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from
each party to the other parties. The signatures of all parties need not
appear on the same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by
facsimile or email transmission or in ".pdf" format that includes a copy of
the sending partyÂ’s signature is as effective as signing and delivering the
counterpart in person.
