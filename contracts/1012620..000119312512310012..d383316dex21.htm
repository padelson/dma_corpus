1 AGREEMENT

In consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

Section 1.1 _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in
accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation under the
Laws of the State of Delaware.

(b) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL
and other applicable Law. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall have all the properties, rights, privileges,
powers, interests and franchises and shall be subject to all restrictions,
disabilities, debts, duties and Liabilities of the Company and Merger Sub.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Closing will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date that is the
second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) set
forth in _Article VI_ (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, NY 10036,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, unless another time, date
or place is agreed to in writing by the parties, if the Marketing Period has
not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions), then the Closing shall occur instead on the date following
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the earlier to occur of
(a) any Business Day before or during the Marketing Period as may be specified
by Parent on no less than two (2) Business Days prior notice to the Company
and (b) the Business Day following the final day of the Marketing Period.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time; Effect of the Merger_. On the Closing Date and
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Certificate of Merger shall be
filed with the Delaware Secretary. The Merger shall become effective at the
Effective Time. The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

Section 1.4 _Conversion of the Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) Except as provided in _Section 1.4(b)_, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Shares_ ")
(excluding Appraisal Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive, in cash without interest, $27.50
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of the Certificate and/or
Letter of Transmittal representing such Shares as provided in _Article II_.
All 

 



2  Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate representing Shares or Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which such Shares have been converted, as provided herein.

(b) Each Share that is owned by the Company as treasury stock and each Share
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist
and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. Each Share
owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time and no
Merger Consideration shall be payable with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger, the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation,
except that, at the Effective Time, _Article I_ of such certificate of
incorporation shall be amended to provide that the corporate name of the
Surviving Corporation is "RailAmerica, Inc." Thereafter, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation may be amended in accordance with
its terms and as provided by Law.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger, the bylaws of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, except that, at the Effective Time, _Article I_ of such
bylaws shall be amended to provide that the corporate name of the Surviving
Corporation is "RailAmerica, Inc." Thereafter, the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation may be amended in accordance with their terms and the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by Law.

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub shall continue in office as the
directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of the Company shall
continue in office as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, and such
directors and officers shall hold office until successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in accordance with and subject to applicable Law and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.7 _Restricted Shares_.

(a) Each share of restricted stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is not then vested under any Company Equity Plan,
agreement or arrangement of the Company, or otherwise (each, a " _Company
Restricted Share_ "), shall, as of the Effective Time, be converted into a
comparable award in respect of Parent Common Stock (each, a " _Parent
Restricted Share_ "), and each such Parent Restricted Share shall continue to
have and

 



3  be subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting and
forfeiture provisions governing the corresponding Company Restricted Share (as
such provisions exist immediately prior to the Effective Time and giving
effect to any applicable "change in control" provisions) immediately prior to
the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each holder of Company Restricted
Shares shall be entitled to receive that number of Parent Restricted Shares
obtained by multiplying (a) the aggregate number of Company Restricted Shares
held by each such individual immediately prior to the Effective Time by (b)
the Conversion Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent
Common Stock subject to a Parent Restricted Share. The "Conversion Ratio"
shall be equal to the quotient of (a) the Merger Consideration and (b) the
average of the closing prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported
on the New York Stock Exchange during the ten (10) trading days preceding the
Closing Date.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 1.7(a)_, with respect to each Company
Restricted Share that vests on or prior to the Closing Date (each, a " _Vested
Share Award_ "), at the Effective Time, each such Vested Share Award shall be
canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (in lieu of any right to receive Parent Restricted
Shares), less any required withholdings. As of the Effective Time, each holder
of Vested Share Awards shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

(c) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or shall otherwise maintain the effectiveness of an existing
registration statement on Form S-8 previously filed by Parent) with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon vesting of the Parent
Restricted Shares promptly following the Effective Time and Parent shall
exercise reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such Parent Restricted Shares remain
outstanding. The Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with and
assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement, if
applicable.

Section 1.8 _Restricted Share Units_.

(a) Each restricted share unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time under any Company Equity Plan, agreement or arrangement of the Company,
or otherwise (each, a " _Company Restricted Share Unit_ " or a " _Company RSU_
"), shall, as of the Effective Time, be converted into a comparable award in
respect of Parent Common Stock (each, a " _Parent Restricted Share Unit_ " or
a " _Parent RSU_ "), and each such Parent Restricted Share Unit shall continue
to have and be subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting,
forfeiture and payment provisions governing the corresponding Company
Restricted Share Unit (as such provisions exist immediately prior to the
Effective Time and giving effect to any applicable "change in control"
provisions) immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time,
each holder of Company RSUs shall be entitled to that number of Parent RSUs
obtained by multiplying (a) the aggregate number of Company RSUs held by each
such individual immediately prior to the Effective Time by (b) the Conversion
Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock subject
to a Parent RSU.

 



4 (b) Notwithstanding _Section 1.8(a)_, with respect to each Company
Restricted Share Unit that vests on or prior to the Closing Date (each, a "
_Vested RSU_ "), at the Effective Time, each such Vested RSU shall be canceled
and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (in lieu of any right to receive Parent RSUs), less any
required withholdings. As of the Effective Time, each holder of Vested RSUs
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or shall otherwise maintain the effectiveness of an existing
registration statement on Form S-8 previously filed by Parent) with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon vesting of the Parent
Restricted Share Units promptly following the Effective Time and Parent shall
exercise reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such Parent Restricted Share Units
remain outstanding. The Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate
with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement, if
applicable.

Section 1.9 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Appraisal Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.4(a)_, but instead
holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262
shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.4(a)_, without interest. At
the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
such rights provided in the preceding two sentences. The Company shall serve
prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any of the Shares,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), or
as otherwise required under the DGCL, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do
any of the foregoing.

Section 1.10 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Subject to the restrictions
contained in _Section 5.1_, in the event that the Company changes the number
of Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender
or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration
shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect such change.

 



5 ARTICLE II

_EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

Section 2.1 _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
the Paying Agent to act as paying agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates pursuant to this _Article II_
, in the case of certificated Shares, and automatically, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Paying Agent cash in the aggregate amount required to pay the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Shares pursuant to  _Section 1.4_ (such cash
amount being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund
shall be used solely for purposes of paying the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article II_ and shall not be used to satisfy any other
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Pending distribution of
the Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Article II_ , Parent may direct the
Paying Agent to invest such cash, provided that such investments (i) shall be
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of domestic commercial banks
with capital exceeding $500,000,000 (collectively " _Permitted Investments_ ")
or money market funds that are invested solely in Permitted Investments and
(ii) shall have maturities that will not prevent or delay payments to be made
pursuant to this _Article II_. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund
will be payable solely to Parent (or its designee). 

Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares
subsequently converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as
set forth in _Section 1.4_: (i) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") that (A) shall specify that delivery shall be effected and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent (or an affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof, together with any bond or indemnity agreement, as contemplated
by _Section 2.6_) and (B) shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify; and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration.

(b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and executed,
and any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation, (i) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a check representing the applicable amount of
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and
(ii) the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the
Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each
such Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration.

 



6 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate
but may, if required by the Paying Agent, be required to deliver an executed
Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_. Each
holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon
the Effective Time or following the Paying Agents receipt of the applicable
Letter of Transmittal (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares
shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after such time,
the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to receive
this _Article II_.

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of the Merger
Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent properly endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer and
accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable Taxes
have been paid.

Section 2.3 _No Further Ownership Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon
the surrender for exchange of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
representing Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares
and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_ , subject to applicable Law in the case of Appraisal Shares.

Section 2.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the former Company Stockholders on the date 12
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent (or its designee)
upon demand, and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore received
any applicable Merger Consideration to which such Company Stockholder is
entitled under this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for
payment of claims with respect thereto and only as a general creditor
thereof.

Section 2.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
Merger Sub shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any part of the Merger

Benefit Plans that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code is hereinafter referred to in this _Section 3.13_ as a "
_Title IV Plan_ ". No Title IV Plan is a multiemployer plan as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA.

(b) No Benefit Plan is a Foreign Benefit Plan. For purposes of this Agreement,
a " _Foreign Benefit Plan_ " means those Benefit Plans maintained, sponsored
or contributed to primarily for the benefit of individuals providing services
to the Company or its Subsidiaries outside of the jurisdiction of the United
States (but excluding any plan, program or arrangement that is mandated by
applicable Law or maintained by a Governmental Entity). 

(c) With respect to each Benefit Plan, the Company has made available to
Parent a true and complete copy of each Benefit Plan, including any
amendments thereto, and a true and complete copy of the following items (in
each case, only if applicable) (i) each trust or other funding arrangement,
(ii) each summary plan description and summary of material modifications,
(iii) the most recently filed annual report on IRS Form 5500, (iv) the most
recent financial statements and actuarial or other valuation reports prepared
with respect thereto, and (v) the most recently received IRS determination or
opinion letter.

 



17 (d) Neither the Company nor any Person that is a member of a "controlled group
of corporations" with, or is under "common control" with, or is a member of
the same "affiliated service group" with the Company, in each case, as defined
in Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, an " _ERISA Affiliate_
") maintains, contributes to, or sponsors (or has in the past six years
maintained, contributed to, or sponsored) a multiemployer plan as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA or any other Title IV Plan. No liability under Title
IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any of its or their ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full,
and no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or its or their ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability,
other than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(which premiums have been paid when due). With respect to each Title IV
Plan set forth on Section 3.13(a) or (d) of the Company Disclosure Letter:
(i) there has not been any failure to satisfy the minimum funding standards
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA,
whether or not waived, and no such plan is in "at risk," "endangered" or
"critical" status within the meaning of Sections 430 and 432 of the Code; (ii)
there has been no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of
ERISA and the regulations thereunder which has not been fully and accurately
reported in a timely fashion, as required by applicable Law; and (iii) there
has not been a partial termination.

 

(e) Each Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and applicable law, including but not
limited to ERISA and the Code. There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened actions, suits, disputes or claims by or on behalf of
any Benefit Plan, by any Company Employee or beneficiary covered under
any such Benefit Plan, as applicable, or otherwise involving any such Benefit
Plan (other than routine claims for benefits). Each Benefit Plan that
constitutes a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code is in documentary and operational compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance thereunder so as to
avoid any interest, penalty or Tax under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

 

(f) With respect to each Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, (i) each such Benefit Plan has been
determined to be so qualified and has received a favorable determination or
opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its
qualification, (ii) the trusts maintained thereunder have been determined to
be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and (iii) no event
has occurred that could reasonably be expected to result in disqualification
or adversely affect such exemption.

 

(g) No Benefit Plan provides welfare benefits, including death or medical
benefits (whether or not insured), beyond retirement or termination of
service, other than coverage mandated solely by applicable Law. The aggregate
unfunded liability of the Benefit Plans set forth on Section 3.13(g) of the
Company Disclosure Letter does not exceed $5,000,000.

 

(h) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
current or former director, employee, officer or individual independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay,
unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as expressly provided
in this Agreement, or (ii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,
vesting, or funding, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
director, employee, officer or individual independent contractor.

 



18 (i) No amounts payable under the Benefit Plans will fail to be deductible for
federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code as a result
of the occurrence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either
alone or in combination with another event.

 

Section 3.14 _Labor Relations_.

(a) There is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown, stoppage or lockout actually
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, since January 1, 2010, there has
not been any such action. Except as listed in Section 3.14(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are party
to any collective bargaining agreements or similar labor agreements. The
Company and its Subsidiaries are, and have at all times been, in material
compliance with all applicable Laws respecting employment and employment
practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages, hours of work and
occupational safety and health, and are not engaged in any unfair labor
practices as defined in the National Labor Relations Act, the Railway Labor
Act or other applicable Law. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Governmental
Entity responsible for the enforcement of labor or employment Laws intends to
conduct an investigation with respect to or relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and no such investigation is in progress.

 

(b) Since January 1, 2011, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not
effectuated (i) a "plant closing" as defined in the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (or similar state or local laws) (the "
_WARN Act_ ") affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or
operating units within any site of employment or facility of the Company or
any Subsidiary, or (ii) a "mass layoff" as defined in the WARN Act affecting
any site of employment or facility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Since January 1, 2010, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have
been affected by any transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment
terminations sufficient in number to trigger application of any Law similar to
the WARN Act.

 

Section 3.15 _Intellectual Property_. Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and complete list
of all patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications, trade
names, service marks, service mark applications, domain name registrations and
registered copyrights and applications therefor (collectively, and together
with unregistered intellectual property rights, " _Intellectual Property
Rights_ ") that, in each case, are material to the conduct of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as presently conducted
and, except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company owns, or is licensed or otherwise has
the right to use, each such scheduled Intellectual Property Right. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe, misappropriate or
otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person, and no
claims are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is infringing the rights of

 



19  any Person with regard to any Intellectual Property Right, except for such
infringements, misappropriations, violations and claims which have not had and
reasonably would not be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the
date of this Agreement, no Person is infringing the rights of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Intellectual Property Right, in a
manner that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

insurance with reputable insurers for the business and assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries against all risks normally insured against, and in
amounts normally carried by, corporations of similar size engaged in similar

Company Material Adverse Effect, all insurance policies and bonds with
respect to the business and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in
full force and effect and will be maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in full force and effect as they apply to any matter, action or
event relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring through the
Effective Time, and the Company and its Subsidiaries have not reached or
exceeded their policy limits for any insurance policies in effect at any time
during the past five years.

 

Section 3.17 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than the
Company Financial Advisor, a true and complete copy of whose engagement
letter has been furnished to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement)
is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers or employees.

Section 3.18 _Company Financial Advisor Opinion_. The Company Financial
Advisor has delivered to the Company Board of Directors its opinion to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the Merger Consideration to be

environmental investigation), other than ordinary course operational visits
for integration planning, with respect to any property of the Company or any

accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement , which Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the "standstill" provisions and any
use restrictions or other similar limitations set forth therein shall be
inapplicable with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any proposal, negotiations or actions by or on behalf of Parent
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
in response to a notice pursuant to _Section 5.6_); provided, further, that
the definition of "Permitted Financing Sources" therein shall be amended to
read "the Financing sources under the Financing Commitments and any other
potential or actual debt or equity financing sources".

(c) No investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

 



32 Section 5.3 _Best Efforts to Consummate Merger; Notification_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such
party pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining all necessary, proper
or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, qualifications and
approvals from Governmental Entities and making all necessary, proper or

necessary to obtain an approval, waiver or exemption from any Governmental
Entity (including under, if applicable, the HSR Act, the Investment Canada
Act, the Competition Act (Canada) and from the STB); (ii) obtaining all
necessary, proper or advisable consents, qualifications, approvals, waivers
or exemptions from non-governmental Third Parties; and (iii) executing and

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall, if applicable, use its best efforts to make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any
event within ten Business Days of the date hereof and any other required
submissions under the HSR Act which the Company or Parent determines should be
made, in each case with respect to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
cooperate with one another (A) in promptly determining whether any filings
are required to be or should be made or consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations are required to be or should be obtained under any other
federal, state or foreign Law or regulation or whether any consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be or should be obtained from other
parties to loan agreements or other contracts or instruments material to the
Companys business in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) in promptly making any such
filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking
to obtain timely any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or

received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this _Section 5.3_ as "Antitrust Counsel
Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the Antitrust Law outside counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or
consultants of the recipient or any of its Affiliates unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the
Company or Parent as the case may be) or its legal

 



33  counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall direct their respective
Antitrust Law outside counsels to comply with this _Section 5.3_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 5.3_, materials
provided to the other party or its counsel may be redacted to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company and privileged
communications.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.3_, if any objections are asserted with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any
other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of
the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law or
which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall use its best efforts to (i) resolve any such
objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections
or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any

Outside Termination Date), including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing
to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (y)
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit the freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the Closing.

(e) In addition to and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company shall, as soon as possible but in any event within ten (10) Business
Days of the date hereof, file with the STB the appropriate and necessary
documentation for the approval or exemption, as the case may be, of the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent also shall, as soon as
possible but in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof,
seek approval or authorization of the STB, through an exemption or notice of
exemption, for a voting trust transaction pursuant to which shares of the
Surviving Corporation shall be placed into an irrevocable voting trust as of
the Effective Time pending receipt of final STB approval or exemption, as the
case may be, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent
shall bear its own costs for the preparation of such filings and responding to
any inquiries or information requests, if applicable, and Parent shall be
responsible for the payment of any applicable filing fees. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall cooperate with one another (A) in promptly making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking to obtain timely any such approval or exemption, and (B) in keeping
the other party reasonably informed of the status of any communications with,

instituted (or threatened to be instituted) against Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or any of their respective directors or officers by a Governmental
Entity challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other, and use its
respective best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding

injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

suit, claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding, and no settlement
thereof shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent.

Statement, the Company, acting through the Company Board of Directors, shall
take all actions in accordance with applicable law, the Company Certificate of
Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as practicable
the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting
upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to _Section 5.6_, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) the Company Board of
Directors shall recommend adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Merger by the Company Stockholders and include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement and (ii) neither the Company Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the
Company Board of Directors that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger. Unless this Agreement
has been duly terminated in accordance with the terms herein, the Company
shall, subject to the right of the Company Board of Directors to modify its
recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent under certain circumstances as
specified in _Section 5.6,_ take all lawful action to solicit from the
Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt this Agreement
and approve the Merger and shall take all other action necessary or advisable
to secure the Company Required Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent,
may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) after
consultation with Parent, solely to the extent necessary to ensure that any
legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to
the Company Stockholders or (ii) with the consent of Parent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld), if as of the time

 



37  for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting.

Section 5.6 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.

(a) The Company agrees that (i) it and its officers and directors shall
not, (ii) its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries officers and directors shall
not and (iii) it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries other Representatives
and RR Acquisition Holding LLC not to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action to knowingly
facilitate, the making of any proposal that constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Takeover Proposal (other than contacting or engaging in
discussions with the Person making a Takeover Proposal or its representatives
for the sole purpose of clarifying such Takeover Proposal) or (B) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any confidential information with respect
to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct its Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all then existing
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted theretofore with
respect to any Takeover Proposal, and shall request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished
in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in
this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to (i) in the event the
Stockholders Written Consent is delivered to the Company in accordance with 
_Section 5.4(a)_, 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the Written Consent End
Date, or (ii) in the event the Stockholders Written Consent is not delivered
to the Company in accordance with _Section 5.4(a)_ and this Agreement is not
terminated by Parent in accordance with _Section 7.1(j)_, the date on which
the Company Required Vote is obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting
(the " _Stockholder Approval Date_ "), in response to an unsolicited bona
fide written Takeover Proposal, if the Company has not breached its
obligations under this _Section 5.6(a)_ and if the Company Board of Directors
determines (x) after consultation with, and taking into account the advice
of, its financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y)
after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may (and may authorize and
permit its Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and Representatives
to), subject to compliance with _Section 5.6(c)_, (A) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions substantially
similar to those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that all
such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to
such Person, and (B) participate in discussions and negotiations with the
Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal.

 

(b) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall
(i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly
propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by

 



38  the Company Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or
the Merger (or take any other action or make any other public statement
inconsistent with such recommendation) or (B) recommend the approval or
adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or
adopt, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Takeover Proposal, other than any confidentiality agreement referred to in
_Section 5.6(a)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. New York City time
on the Written Consent End Date (in the event the Stockholders Written
Consent is delivered to the Company in accordance with _Section 5.4(a)_) or
the Stockholder Approval Date (in the event the Stockholders Written Consent
is not delivered to the Company in accordance with _Section 5.4(a)_ and this
Agreement is not terminated by Parent in accordance with  _Section 7.1(j)_),
as applicable, and subject to compliance with this _Section 5.6(b)_ and
_Section 5.6(a)_, the Company Board of Directors may, if, after consultation
with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside counsel, it
determines that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (1) make an Adverse Recommendation
Change; _provided_ , that in the event the Stockholders Written Consent is
delivered to the Company in accordance with _Section 5.4(a)_, the Company
Board of Directors may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change after such
Stockholders Written Consent is so delivered, or (2) cause or permit the
Company to terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a definitive
agreement regarding a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change,
and the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (2)
above, until after the third Business Day following Parents receipt of
written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising
Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, including the material terms and conditions
of (and documents relating to) any Superior Proposal (and the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal) that is the basis of the proposed
action by such Company Board of Directors and a statement that the Company
Board of Directors intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)_ and during such three Business Day period, if requested by Parent,
the Company and its Representatives shall engage in good faith negotiations
with Parent and its Representatives to, among other things, amend this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents in such a manner that (i) any
Takeover Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no
longer is a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure of the Company Board of
Directors to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being
understood and agreed that (I) any amendment to the financial terms or any
other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice
of Superior Proposal and a new three (3) Business Day period and (II) in
determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or to cause or
permit the Company to so terminate this Agreement, the Company Board of
Directors shall take into account any changes to the financial or other terms
of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents proposed by Parent to
the Company in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise).

 



39 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
5.6(a)_ and _Section 5.6(b)_, the Company shall as soon as practicable
advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal or
any request for information or other inquiry that the Company reasonably
believes could lead to any Takeover Proposal after the date of this
Agreement, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal or
request for information or other inquiry and the identity of the Person making
any such Takeover Proposal or request for information or other inquiry. The
Company shall, subject to the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of
Directors under applicable Law, keep Parent reasonably informed of any
material developments with respect to any such Takeover Proposal or request
for information or other inquiry (including any material changes thereto).

(d) Nothing contained in this  _Section 5.6_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations
under U.S. federal or state Law, including taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen"
communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or any similar disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board of Directors determines (after consultation
with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable Law, it being understood, however, that
this clause (ii) shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board of Directors
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or take any of the actions referred
to in clause (ii) of _Section 5.6(b)_ except, in each case, to the
extent permitted by _Section 5.6(b)_.

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements (including scheduling for a press conference or conference call
with investors or analysts) with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of
the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the
other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be
required by Law or Order, the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange
or any listing agreement with the New York Stock Exchange.

Section 5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and continuing through
December 31, 2013 (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to the Company Employees who are
employees of the Company or a Subsidiary at the Effective Time (collectively,
the " _Transferred Employees_ ") and who remain employees of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries during the Continuation
Period, (i) base salary, and annual incentive bonus opportunities that are no
less favorable than the base salary and target bonus opportunities applicable
to such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
employee benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to the employee
benefits provided to such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _provided_ , _however_ that for all purposes of this _Section
5.8_, Parent shall provide to any Transferred Employee who is represented for
purposes of collective bargaining by any labor organization with the wages,
hours and other terms and conditions of employment as provided for in any
applicable collective bargaining agreement or pursuant to applicable Law.

 



40 (b) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide each Transferred
Employee who incurs an involuntary termination of employment without cause
with severance payments and severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the greater of (1) the severance payments and severance benefits to which such
employees would have been entitled with respect to such termination under the
severance policies of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (2) the severance payments and severance benefits to which
a similarly situated employee of Parent would have been entitled with respect
to such termination under the severance policies of Parent.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company
Equity Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time and the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be deemed to constitute
a "change in control," "change of control" or "corporate transaction" under
such Company Equity Plans, arrangements or agreements.

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall be permitted to pay
to each eligible Transferred Employee, upon the Effective Time, a pro rata
bonus in respect of the Companys 2012 fiscal year based on the Companys
determination, in good faith (and in consultation with Parent), of the amounts
earned, based on actual performance through the Effective Time, under the
Companys incentive bonus plans set forth in Section 5.8(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter; provided, that such payments shall be allocated in a manner
consistent with past practice and as described in Section 5.8(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parents or the
Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, give Transferred
Employees full credit for such Transferred Employees service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not for
purposes of benefit accruals (except for vacation and severance), under any
benefit plans made generally available to employees or officers or any class
or level of employees or officers maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which a
Transferred Employee participates to the same extent recognized by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service.

(f) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parents or the
Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries, as applicable, to use reasonable best
efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise
applicable to Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents under any
plan of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent that provides health benefits in
which Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate following the
Effective Time, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to
such employees as of the Effective Time under the analogous Benefit Plan, (ii)
honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in
which they participated immediately prior to the Effective Time during the

 



41  portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
which they are eligible to participate after the Effective Time in the same
plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums
were incurred and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Transferred
Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Time, in
each case to the extent such Transferred Employee or eligible dependent
had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no current or
former employee, director or individual independent contractor or any
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purposes as a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing contained herein, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Transferred Employee or any other
Person any benefits under any benefit plans, programs, policies or other
arrangements, including severance benefits or the right to employment or
continued employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any period by reason of this Agreement.
No provision of this _Section 5.8_ constitutes an employment agreement or an
amendment to or adoption of any employee benefit plan of or by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates or shall
alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any of them in accordance with the terms of such
plan, program, agreement or arrangement and applicable Law. Following the
Effective Time, nothing contained in this _Section 5.8_ shall interfere with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates
right to terminate the employment of any employee for any reason.

Section 5.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") for acts or
omissions related to such Indemnified Partys service as a director or officer
of the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other applicable Law
or provided under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company
Bylaws in effect on the date hereof; provided that such indemnification shall
be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law.

(b) From the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years thereafter,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect
directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who
are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy (a copy of which has been made available or delivered to
Parent) on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable
than those of such current insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in
any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently
paid by the Company for such insurance, which annual premiums currently paid
are set

 



42  forth on Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Maximum
Premium_ "); and _provided_ , _further_ , that, if the annual premiums for
such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Premium, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that at the Companys option in lieu of the foregoing insurance
coverage, the Company shall purchase prior to the Effective Time six (6) year
"tail" insurance coverage that provides coverage identical in all material
respects to the coverage described above, provided that the Company does not
pay more than the Maximum Premium.

(c) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or
other agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement and furnished to Parent prior to the date hereof shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at
the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. Further, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions
no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of former or present directors and officers than are presently
set forth in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals, except as
amendments may be required by the DGCL during such period.

(d) This _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each
Indemnified Party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified
Parties. The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs, and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

 

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this _Section
5.9_.

Section 5.10 _No Control of the Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the Companys 

 



43  or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time, and nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give the Company, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct Parents or its Subsidiaries operations prior
to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and
Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

Section 5.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of
the Financing, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) with respect to
the Debt Financing Commitments negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Financing Commitments and (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions within
the control of Parent or Merger Sub, and otherwise comply with all
terms, applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in such definitive agreements. In
the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitments and such portion is
reasonably required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company and shall
use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from
alternative sources upon terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent and
Merger Sub (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than those contained in the
applicable Financing Commitments as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with any portion
of the Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material
breach (of which Parent becomes aware) by any party to the Financing
Commitments or any termination of the Financing Commitments. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action
that would reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of the
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments or in any definitive
agreement related to the Financing. Parent shall keep the Company informed on
a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts
to arrange the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub may agree to or permit any
amendment, supplement or other modification to be made to, or any waiver of
any material provision or remedy under, the Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing and may obtain financing in
substitution of all or a portion of the Financing, so long as they consult
with the Company and promptly provide the Company with such information it may
reasonably request regarding any alternative financing arrangements or plans.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Financing (or any alternative) has not been
obtained by the Outside Termination Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall continue
to be obligated to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ of this Agreement and to Parents rights
under _Section 7.1_, regardless of whether Parent and Merger Sub have
complied with all of their obligations under this Agreement (including their
obligations under this _Section 5.11_).

(b) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its respective Representatives to, provide to
Parent and Merger Sub all reasonable cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Financing (or any

 



44  potential alternative financing) and to assist Parent in causing the
conditions to the Financing Commitments to be satisfied, including (i)
furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing sources (as promptly as
practicable) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the related statements of income, change in equity and cash
flows as of the end of the most recent quarterly period prior to the
execution of this Agreement and any quarterly period ending after the
execution of this Agreement, all Company information, financial statements and
financial data, and reports and other information regarding the Company and
its Subsidiaries, of the type required in registration statements on Form S-3
by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of a type
and form customarily included in registered public offerings of equity under
the Securities Act or otherwise necessary to receive from the Companys
independent accountants customary "comfort" (including negative assurance
comfort) with respect to the financial information to be included in such
registration statement, audited financial statements as of December 31, 2010
and 2011, and for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2011 and the other financial data and financial information of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that are required under Paragraph (v) of
Annex II to the Debt Financing Commitment, and customary pro forma financial
statements and information (information required to be delivered pursuant to
this clause (i) being referred to as, the " _Required Financial Information_
"), (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary
one-on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers, underwriters or
agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Financing (or any
potential alternative financing) and including senior management and
Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company and
its Subsidiaries), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the
Financing (or any potential alternative financing), (iii) assisting with the
preparation of customary materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda, offering documents, prospectuses, registration
statements and similar documents required in connection with the Financing (or
any potential alternative financing) (including requesting any consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the
Financing and the delivery of one or more customary representation letters),
(iv) using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary accountants comfort
letters and legal opinions as reasonably requested by Parent and facilitating
the pledging of collateral in connection with the Financing, including
executing and delivering any customary pledge and security documents
(including security documents to be filed with the United States Copyright
Office and the United States Patent and Trademark Office to register
copyrights, patents and trademarks, as applicable, of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent required in connection with the Financing (or any
potential alternative financing)), currency or interest hedging arrangements
or other definitive financing documents or other certificates, legal opinions,
surveys, title insurance and documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company
with respect to solvency matters as of the Closing, on a pro forma basis), (v)
causing the taking of corporate actions (subject to the occurrence of the
Closing) by the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to
permit the completion of the Financing (or any potential alternative
financing) ( _provided_ that nothing herein shall require the Company Board of
Directors to approve the Financing), (vi) facilitating the execution and
delivery at the Closing of definitive documents related to the Financing on
the terms contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, (vii) cooperating
with consultants or others engaged to undertake field examinations and
appraisals, 

 



45  including furnishing information to such persons in respect of accounts
receivable, inventory, equipment, property and other applicable assets and
liabilities, (viii) providing to the Financing sources (or sources of any
potential alternative financing) all documentation and other information
reasonably requested by such Financing sources that such Financing sources
reasonably determine is required by regulatory authorities with respect to
the Company under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, (ix) assisting Parent in
connection with its amendment of any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
hedging, swap or derivative arrangements on terms satisfactory to Parent, (x)
cooperating in procuring, prior to the date that is twenty (20) consecutive
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, corporate and facilities ratings for
the Debt Financing and (xi) providing authorization letters to the Financing
sources authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders and
containing a representation to the Financing sources that the public
side versions of such documents, if any, do not include material non-public
information about the Company or its Affiliates or securities; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to take any action that would subject it to actual or
potential liability or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or provide
or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of
the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, unless such action is contingent
upon the Closing. The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries trademarks, service marks and logos in
connection with the Financing (or any potential alternative financing);
_provided_ that such trademarks, service marks and logos are used in a manner
that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. If the Closing does not occur, Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and its Representatives from
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by it in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including actions taken at
the request of Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.11(b)_) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or other information
furnished by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries), except in the
event such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties arose out of or result from the gross
negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives. Parent shall from
time to time, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with this _Section 5.11(b)_.

(c) In the event that the Debt Financing Commitment (or any related definitive
agreements) or the Equity Financing Commitment are amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified, including as a result of obtaining

Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_, or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by

the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination, a Takeover Proposal

Board of Directors or shall have been publicly announced or publicly made
known to the stockholders of the Company, and (B) within twelve (12) months of
such termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement
with respect to any Takeover Proposal (that is ultimately consummated), or any
Takeover Proposal shall have been consummated (in each case, whether or not
such Takeover Proposal is the same as the original Takeover Proposal
made, communicated, publicly made known or publicly announced), then the
Company shall pay Parent, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, the
Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds (A)
concurrently with the termination, in the case of the preceding clause (i),
(B) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days following such termination) in the case of clause (ii) and (C)
upon the earlier of the Company entering into an agreement providing for such
Takeover Proposal or the consummation of such Takeover Proposal in the case of
clause (iii). For purposes of _Section 7.2(b)(iii)_ only, the definition of

more" shall be deemed references to "more than 50%".

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_, then Parent shall pay, as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty, $135,000,000 (the " _Financing Failure Fee_ ")
to the Company as promptly as practicable (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days following such termination), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Companys right to terminate this Agreement and receive the Financing
Failure Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2(c)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company and its Affiliates against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Financing Sources Parties and any of their respective former, current, or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, affiliates, employees, agents or other Representatives
(" _Parent Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result of any breach
of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or

 



51  the failure of the Merger to be consummated, or in respect of any oral
representation made or alleged to be have been made in connection herewith, in
each case, in any circumstance in which the Company is permitted to terminate
this Agreement and receive the Financing Failure Fee pursuant to this _Section
7.2(c)_ and upon payment of such amounts, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any
Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (except that Parent shall remain obligated for any
reimbursement or indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to the
final two sentences of _Section 5.11(b)_) or in respect of any other
document or theory of law or equity or in respect of oral representations made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith, whether in equity or at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement or to have failed
to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, including for
purposes of _Section 7.1(f)_, solely as a result of the failure of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on
the date the Closing was required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_
due to the proceeds of the Financing not being available in full pursuant to
the Financing Commitments or any other definitive agreements relating thereto
(or any amendment, replacement or supplement to any such
Financing Commitments or definitive agreements).

(d) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of
action that may be based upon or arise out of this Agreement may only be made
against, the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company (and any of
its respective stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates (other than, for
the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub), directors, officers,
employees, representatives or agents) hereby waives any rights or claims it
may have against (i) any Financing source (including each party (other than
Parent and Merger Sub) to one or more Financing Commitments or any definitive
agreements relating thereto or any amendment, replacement or supplement to any
such Financing Commitments or definitive agreements) and (ii) any of the
former, current or future stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents of a Person
described in clause (i) or any of its Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries)
(collectively, " _Financing Source Parties_ "), in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing
waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing Source Party shall
have any liability for any claims or damages to the Company (or any of its
stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, Parent or Merger Sub), directors, officers, employees, representatives
or agents) in connection with this Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the
Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 7.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 7.1_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company,
except that (i) the provisions of _Section 5.2(b)_, _Section 7.2_, this
_Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_ and the last two sentences of _Section
5.11(b)_ shall survive termination and (ii) except as provided in _Section
7.2(c)_, nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any

 



52  willful or intentional breach of this Agreement or for fraud. For purposes
of this Agreement, "willful or intentional breach" shall mean a material
breach that is a consequence of an omission by, or act undertaken by or
caused by, the breaching party with the knowledge (actual or constructive)
that the omission or taking or causing of such act would, or would reasonably
be expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement. 

Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in
writing by action of their respective Boards of Directors at any time before
or after the Company Required Vote has been obtained and prior to the filing
of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, after the Company Required Vote shall have been obtained,
no such amendment, modification or supplement shall be made which by law
requires the further approval of the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended, changed or supplemented
or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
all of the parties.

 

Section 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, or (c) subject to the provisions of _Section 7.4_, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights.

The undersigned (the " _Stockholder_ "), being the holder of a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of RAILAMERICA, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), hereby irrevocably consents in
writing, pursuant to Section 228(a) and Section 251 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and as authorized by the
Section 2.9 of the By-laws of the Company, to the following actions and
adoption of the following resolutions by written consent in lieu of a meeting
of stockholders:

 

WHEREAS, the Company has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of July 23, 2012, by and among the Company,
Genesee and Wyoming Inc. (" _Parent_ ") and Jaguar Acquisition Sub Inc. ("
_Merger Sub_ "), a copy of which has been provided to the undersigned
Stockholder and is attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (capitalized terms used
herein without definition shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them
in the Merger Agreement);

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation of the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger
(the " _Effective Time_ "), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Appraisal Shares and
shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury
stock, owned by any wholly owned subsidiary of Company or owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent) will be converted into the right
to receive $27.50 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"); WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has received the opinion
of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., dated as of the date of the Merger
Agreement, addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company, to the effect
that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration to be received by the holders
of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that it is
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (ii) approved the
execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement, and (iii) resolved to recommend the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the Merger, by the holders of the shares of the Company Common Stock, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein;

 

WHEREAS, the affirmative vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement
by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast thereon by the stockholders of
the Company is required pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL; and

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement and in accordance with Section
251(d) of the DGCL, the Company Board of Directors has the power to terminate
the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances after the Company Required
Vote is obtained by this written consent, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED as follows:

 

RESOLVED, that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, are hereby adopted, authorized, accepted and approved
in all respects, and that the undersigned Stockholder hereby votes all of the
shares of capital stock of the Company held by such Stockholder and entitled
to vote thereon in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger; provided,
however, that this  written consent shall be of no further force or effect following any
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (including,
without limitation, pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)_ thereof); and

FURTHER RESOLVED, that this written consent is coupled with an interest and
is irrevocable; and

FURTHER RESOLVED, that the undersigned Stockholder hereby waives any and
all notice requirements, with respect to the time and place of meeting, and
consents to the transaction of all business represented by this written
consent.

This written consent shall be filed with the minutes of the meetings of the
stockholders of the Company and shall be treated for all purposes as action
taken at a meeting.
