\- 5 - Section 1.11 Adjustment of Transaction Consideration Resulting From
Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital Shortfall.

(a) No more than three (3) Business Days prior to the Effective Date, the
Company and the Buyer shall jointly prepare, or cause to be prepared, a
statement (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement") which shall set
forth a good faith and reasonable itemized calculation of the estimated
Working Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital Amount") expected as of the
Effective Date. If the Estimated Working Capital Amount as reflected on the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement is less than the lower end of the
Target Working Capital Range, then the Transaction Consideration shall be
decreased by the difference between the Estimated Working Capital Amount and
the lower end of the Target Working Capital Range. If the Estimated Working
Capital Amount as reflected on the Estimated Closing Working Capital
Statement is greater than the higher end of the Target Working Capital Range,
then the Transaction Consideration shall be increased by the difference
between the Estimated Working Capital Amount and the higher end of the Target
Working Capital Range and the amount of the excess shall be deposited in the
Working Capital Escrow Fund (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) on the
Effective Date until final determination of the Actual Working Capital Amount.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that there will be no adjustment to the
Transaction Consideration (and no funds deposited into the Working Capital
Escrow Fund) if the Estimated Working Capital Amount is within the Target
Working Capital Range and that any adjustments to Transaction Consideration
made pursuant to this Section 1.11(a) will be reversed pursuant to Section
1.11(d) if the Actual Working Capital Amount is within the Target Working
Capital Range.

 

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Effective Date, the Buyer shall prepare,
or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Shareholders Representative, a
statement (the "Actual Closing Working Capital Statement") which shall set
forth an itemized calculation of the actual Working Capital (the "Actual
Working Capital Amount") as of the Effective Date.

(c) The Shareholders Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders, shall
have thirty (30) days after its delivery to review the Actual Closing Working
Capital Statement. The Shareholders Representative shall have reasonable
access to the work papers of the Buyer and the accountants used in preparing
the Actual Closing Working Capital Statement. If the Shareholders
Representative objects to the Actual Working Capital Amount, the Shareholders
Representative shall inform the Buyer in writing within such thirty (30)-day
period (an "Objection"), setting forth a specific description of the basis of
the Objection and a statement reflecting the adjustments to the Actual Working
Capital Amount which the Shareholders Representative believes should be made.
The Buyer and the Shareholders Representative shall then have fifteen (15)
days to attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with respect to any
disputed matters with respect to the Actual Working Capital Amount. In
reviewing any Objection, the Buyers accountants shall have reasonable access
to the work papers of the Shareholders Representative and its accountants. If
the Parties are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with respect to
the determination of the foregoing items within said fifteen (15)-day period,
they shall submit their respective prepared working capital statements to an
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Shareholders Representative and
the Buyer (the "Audit Firm"). The Audit Firm shall, acting as an expert and
not as an arbitrator, determine in accordance with this Agreement, and only
with respect to the remaining differences so submitted, whether and to what
extent, if any, the Actual Closing Working Capital Statement requires
adjustment; provided, however, that the adjustment to the Actual Closing
Working Capital Statement finally determined by the Audit Firm shall not be
greater than the greatest Actual Working Capital Amount calculated by either
Party or less than the smallest Actual Working Capital Amount calculated by
either Party. The Audit Firm shall consider only those items to which a Party
has objected and that the Parties have not been able to resolve amicably. The
Parties shall direct the Audit 

 



\- 6 -  Firm to use all reasonable efforts to render its determination within thirty
(30) days after such submission. The Audit Firms determination regarding any
such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding upon the Buyer and the
Shareholders. The fees and disbursements of the Audit Firm in rendering its
determination shall be borne by the party losing the majority of the amount at
issue in the dispute. The Buyer and the Shareholders Representative shall
make readily available to the Audit Firm all relevant books and records and
any work papers (including those of the Parties respective accountants)
relating to the Actual Closing Working Capital Statement and all other items
reasonably requested by the Audit Firm. The "Final Working Capital Statement"
shall be deemed to be (i) the Actual Closing Working Capital Statement if no
Objection is delivered by the Shareholders Representative during the thirty
(30)-day period specified above or (ii) if an Objection is delivered by the
Shareholders Representative, the Actual Closing Working Capital Statement, as
adjusted by either (A) the agreement of the Parties or (B) the Audit Firm.

(d) Upon the determination of the Actual Working Capital Amount in accordance
with Section 1.11(c), the Transaction Consideration shall be adjusted
accordingly, with payments as follows:

(i) If the Estimated Working Capital Amount was greater than the higher end
of the Target Working Capital Range then: (A) the payment made to the Working
Capital Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 1.11(a) shall be distributed in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Parent and
Shareholders Representative shall jointly direct the Escrow Agent to
distribute such payment in accordance with the Escrow Agreement within ten
(10) days after the final determination of the Final Working Capital
Statement; and (B) either (I) to the extent the Actual Working Capital Amount
as reflected on the Final Working Capital Statement is greater than the
Estimated Working Capital Amount, then the difference between such Actual
Working Capital Amount and the Estimated Working Capital Amount shall be paid
by the Buyer to the Shareholders Representative (or to such other Person as
the Shareholders Representative may direct in writing) within ten (10) days
after the final determination of the Final Working Capital Statement; or (II)
to the extent the Actual Working Capital Amount as reflected on the Final
Working Capital Statement is less than the lower end of the Target Working
Capital Range, then the Buyer shall be entitled to be paid the difference
between such Actual Working Capital Amount and the lower end of the Target
Working Capital Range (to the extent outside of the Target Working Capital
Range and not already accounted for in clause (A) above) by the Shareholders
Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders), or in the Buyers sole
discretion, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, within ten (10) days after the
final determination of the Final Working Capital Statement.

(ii) If the Estimated Working Capital Amount was less than the lower end of
the Target Working Capital Range then: (A) to the extent the Actual Working
Capital Amount as reflected on the Final Working Capital Statement is greater
than the Estimated Working Capital Amount, then the difference between such
Actual Working Capital Amount and the Estimated Working Capital Amount shall
be paid by the Buyer to the Shareholders Representative (or to such other
Person as the Shareholders Representative may direct in writing) within ten
(10) days after the final determination of the Final Working Capital
Statement (unless: (I) the Actual Working Capital Amount is within the Target
Working Capital Range, in which case the amount of the payment by the Buyer
will be equal to the decrease in Transaction Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.11(a)) or (II) the Actual Working Capital Amount is above the Target
Working Capital Range, in which case the amount of the payment by the Buyer
will be equal to the sum of (x) the difference between the Estimated Working
Capital Amount and the lower end of the Target Working Capital Range, plus (y)
the difference between the Actual Working

 



\- 7 -  Capital Amount and the higher end of the Target Working Capital Range); or
(B) to the extent that the Actual Working Capital Amount as reflected on the
Final Working Capital Statement is less than the Estimated Working Capital
Amount, then the Buyer shall be entitled to be paid the difference between
such Actual Working Capital Amount and the Estimated Working Capital Amount by
the Shareholders Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders), or in the
Buyers sole discretion, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, within ten (10) days
after the final determination of the Final Working Capital Statement.

 

(iii) If the Estimated Working Capital Amount was within the Target Working
Capital Range then: (A) to the extent the Actual Working Capital Amount as
reflected on the Final Working Capital Statement is also within the Target
Working Capital Range, then no adjustment to the Transaction Consideration
shall be made; (B) to the extent the Actual Working Capital Amount as
reflected on the Final Working Capital Statement is greater than the higher
end of the Target Working Capital Range, then the difference between such
Actual Working Capital Amount and higher end of the Target Working Capital
Range shall be paid by the Buyer to the Shareholders Representative (or to
such other Person as the Shareholders Representative may direct in writing)
within ten (10) days after the final determination of the Final Working
Capital Statement; or (C) to the extent that the Actual Working Capital
Amount as reflected on the Final Working Capital Statement is less than the
lower end of the Target Working Capital Range, then the Buyer shall be
entitled to be paid the difference between such Actual Working Capital Amount
and the lower end of the Target Working Capital Range by the Shareholders
Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders), or in the Buyers sole
discretion, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, within ten (10) days after the
final determination of the Final Working Capital Statement.

Section 1.12 Company Options.

 

In accordance with the Plan of Arrangement, at the Effective Time all Company
Options shall become fully vested and exercisable and each Company Option
shall be purchased for cancellation by the Company (from the Companys
available funds) for the Option Consideration. The parties acknowledge that no
deduction will be claimed by the Company in respect of payments made to
a holder of Company Options so cancelled who is a resident of Canada or who
is employed in Canada (both within the meaning of the Tax Act) in respect of
Company Options acquired by such holder by virtue of his or her employment,
and the Company shall: (i) where applicable, make an election pursuant to
subsection 110(1.1) of the Tax Act in respect of such payments, and (ii)
provide evidence in writing of such election to such holders, it being
understood that such holders may be entitled to claim a deduction in respect
of any benefit arising from the cancellation of such Company Options. The
Company shall file such election within the time and in such manner as may be
prescribed under the Tax Act. Upon completion of the Arrangement, the Company
Option Plan shall be wholly terminated and of no further force or effect.

Section 1.13 Restricted Cash Account Matters.



   (a) | The Parent and the Company agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Companys Restricted Cash Accounts to become unrestricted
such that there are no longer cash collateral requirements relating thereto;
provided, however that nothing in this Agreement will require the Parent or
the Buyer to pay any funds or post any collateral to secure any obligations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take all such action as may be necessary
or desirable to ensure that the Company letters of credit and the margin on
the Companys currency forward contracts secured by Restricted Cash Accounts
do not constitute indebtedness prior to the Closing. 
---|--- 
 



\- 8 - unrestricted prior to Closing such that no cash collateral or term deposits
are required to secure letters of credit or margins on currency forward
contracts, any such amounts shall be deemed to be Excess Company Funds. 
---|--- 



   (c) | To the extent that any cash collateral requirement respecting any
Restricted Cash Account remains in place on Closing, the Buyer agrees that:
(i) such Restricted Cash Account, including any interest earned from time to
time thereon, shall be held by the Company pending expiry, discharge or other
release of all cash collateral requirements relating to such Restricted Cash
Account; and (ii) the Buyer shall pay to the Shareholders Representative (on
behalf of the Shareholders), within ten (10) days following such expiry,
discharge or other release of all cash collateral requirements relating to
such Restricted Cash Account, an amount equal to the funds then held in such
released account as an adjustment to the consideration for the Shares
effective nunc pro tunc for all income Tax purposes.

occurred, is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company is threatened,
which, with the giving of notice, lapse of time, or the happening of any
further event, occurrence, condition or act, would constitute a breach or
default by the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party

Authority, or any Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party
or by which it or any of their respective properties, assets or rights is

representatives in connection with the financing (the "Purchaser Financing")

interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
provided further that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required
to provide cooperation that involves any binding commitment by the Company or
any Subsidiary which commitment is not conditional on the completion of the
Arrangement and does not terminate without liability to the Company and its
Subsidiaries upon the termination of this Agreement), including by:



   (a) | participating at a reasonable number of meetings, drafting
sessions, presentations, road shows, and rating agency and due diligence
sessions;

Purchaser Financing. In the event that the completion of the Arrangement does
occur as contemplated under this Agreement, any of the foregoing expenses

acting reasonably (each, a "Pre-Acquisition Reorganization"), provided such
Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations do not result in any detriment to either
Company or any of the Subsidiaries in the reasonable opinion of the Companys
tax advisors; and (ii) co-operate with the Buyer and its advisors in order to
determine the nature of the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations that might be
undertaken and the manner in which they might most effectively be undertaken.
In the event that the completion of the 

 



\- 34 -  Arrangement does not occur as contemplated under this Agreement, the Company
and the Subsidiaries shall be reimbursed for their legal and accounting fees
and expenses paid to third parties as are reasonably incurred implementing
any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization, and for such legal and accounting fees and
expenses paid to third parties as are reasonably incurred in unwinding any
steps taken by the Company or the Subsidiaries in furtherance thereof. In the
event that the completion of the Arrangement does occur as contemplated under
this Agreement, any of the foregoing legal fees and expenses and any liability
for Taxes incurred by the Company or the Subsidiaries arising as a result
of a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization or any part thereof shall be treated for

without limitation, the fees and expenses of financial advisors, accountants

if incurred by the Company or its shareholders shall be paid by the Company

be paid by Buyer and (ii) if incurred by the Company, shall be paid out of the
Companys available funds prior to Closing.

Section 5.4 Confidentiality.

 

Without limiting the effect of any non-disclosure or confidentiality
agreement(s) currently in effect as between the Buyer and the Company ("Prior
Confidentiality Agreements"), all of which shall remain in full force and
effect, each of the parties hereby agrees to keep any information or knowledge
obtained pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby confidential, provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to information or knowledge which

harmless the present and former directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Company Indemnified Parties"), to the

 



\- 36 -  maximum extent permitted under Law, in respect of acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Effective Date, to the extent provided under and
in accordance with written indemnification agreements with such individuals
and/or the By-laws or the Companys certificate of incorporation, in each case
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement and delivered to Buyer. The
provisions of this Section 5.5(a) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each such Company Indemnified Party.

(b) Insurance Policy. Prior to the Effective Date, the Company shall purchase
a DandO Insurance Tail Policy that is reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. For
avoidance of doubt, the purchase price of such DandO Insurance Tail Policy shall
be paid out of the Companys available cash prior to Closing.

Section 5.6 Tax Returns

 

(a) Preparation of Tax Returns. The Buyer shall cause the Company and each
Subsidiary (and each successor thereto) to prepare and file all
its respective income Tax Returns due after the Effective Date in respect of
periods ending on or prior to Closing, which Tax Returns shall be prepared and
filed on a timely basis consistent with the existing procedures for preparing
such Tax Returns and in a manner consistent with prior practice, with respect
to the treatment of specific items on the Tax Returns (to the extent such
treatment is reasonable in the circumstances); provided that, if income taxes
would be payable by the Company or any Subsidiary for any such period in the
absence of the claiming of the maximum amount of any discretionary or other
available deductions or loss carryforward balances available to it, then the
Tax Returns for such corporation, as the case may be, must be prepared on the
basis that such corporation will claim such portion of the maximum amount of
any discretionary deductions or loss carryforward balances available to it for
that period that would result in the least amount of income taxes being
payable by such corporation in respect of that period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent the Buyer reasonably determines that any prior Tax
Return was not prepared in accordance with applicable Law, the Buyer shall not
be required to prepare such Tax Return on a basis consistent with past
practice.

(b) Filing of Tax Returns. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date of any such income Tax Return, the Buyer will provide the Shareholders
Representative with a draft form of the Tax Return (the "Draft Return"). The
Shareholders Representative and its advisors will have the right to review
the Draft Return and any working papers relating to its preparation and to
approve such Draft Return before any such Draft Return is filed with the
relevant Governmental Authority. Within fifteen (15) days after the date
that the Shareholders Representative receives the Draft Return, the
Shareholders Representative will advise the Buyer in writing that the
Shareholders Representative either (i) agrees with the Draft Return so
received by it, or (ii) does not agree with the Draft Return so received by
it, in which event the Shareholders Representative will set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement. If the Shareholders
Representative notifies the Buyer of a disagreement pursuant to clause (ii)
above, the Shareholders Representative and the Buyer shall attempt to resolve
such disagreement; provided, however, that if the Shareholders Representative
and the Buyer fail to reach agreement, then the Buyer shall be entitled to
file or cause to be filed such Tax Return in the manner that it so determines
provided that (A) the Tax Return has been prepared in accordance with Section
5.6(a) and such Tax Return is filed or caused to be filed by the Buyer on or
before the date on which it is required by Law to be filed with the applicable
Governmental Authority and (B) the Shareholders shall not be liable for any
Losses to the Buyer resulting directly or indirectly from an assessment or
reassessment of any such Tax Return with respect to the particular item in
such Tax Return that was the subject of the disagreement between the
Shareholders Representative and the Buyer, but only to the extent that the
change to such Tax Return requested in writing by the Shareholders
Representative and rejected by the Buyer has reasonable support under
applicable Law as evidenced by a customary legal opinion delivered by legal
counsel to the Shareholders Representative.

(including, for the avoidance of doubt, losses in excess of US$200,000 but
less than US$400,000); provided, however, that the limitations in this

respect of any Losses in excess of the Escrow Amounts to which the shareholder

Buyer Indemnified Parties or satisfied by any other Person, including any
insurer.

 

(iv) To the extent that any payment is made by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
in respect of any Losses and the Buyer subsequently obtains a deduction for
corporation tax purposes in respect of the whole or part of the matter to
which such Losses relate then, to the extent that the payment originally made
by the Buyer Indemnified Parties did not reflect the availability of such
deduction, the Shareholders shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Buyer
Indemnified Parties promptly following the date of assessment of such
corporation tax of the amount of corporation tax actually saved as a result
of the whole or part of such payment being deductible for corporation tax
purposes.

(v) No Losses shall be recoverable against the Shareholders under this
Agreement to the extent that such Losses are attributable to (A) any
reorganisation or change in ownership of the Buyer or its Parent or of any
assets of the Buyer after closing or change in any accounting basis for
valuing the Buyers assets; (B) any accounting basis, method, policy or
practice which is different from that adopted or used in the preparation of

Financing.

(vi) The Shareholders shall not be liable under this Agreement for any Losses

granted by or made with any Governmental Authority or as a result of any
change after the date of this Agreement of any generally accepted
interpretation or application of any legislation or in the enforcement policy
or practice of the relevant authorities or as a result of the withdrawal of
any extra-statutory concession or any other formal agreement or
arrangements with any Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force
of law) currently granted by or made with any Governmental Authority.

 

(vii) Each provision of this section shall be read and construed without
prejudice to each of the other provisions of this section.

(viii) The limitations set forth in this Agreement shall apply to any
purported exercise by any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties of their
respective rights under the Escrow Agreement as against the Shareholders
Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders).

 

The foregoing limitations shall not apply in the event of fraud or gross
negligence.

 

(e) Subject to applicable Law, the Shareholders Representative (on behalf of
the Shareholders) and Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment made
pursuant to this Section 8.2 as an adjustment to the consideration for the
Shares effective _nunc pro tunc_ for all income Tax purposes. If,
notwithstanding the treatment required by the preceding sentence, any
indemnification is determined to be taxable to a Buyer Indemnified Party
receiving such payment by any Governmental Authority, the Shareholders
Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders) shall also indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Party for any Taxes incurred by reason of the receipt of such
payment.

Section 8.3 Shareholders Representative.

 

(a) Shareholders Representative shall act as the representative of the
Shareholders and shall be authorized to act on behalf of such holders, and to

therewith.

consideration with respect to his or her Company Options other than any cash
payment to which such Option holder is entitled to receive in accordance

Tax withholding obligation with respect to the Arrangement or the exercise,
cancellation or cash-out of any Company Options or the vesting of restricted
stock interests under the Tax Act, the Code or any other provision of
applicable Tax Law. Withholding in respect of stock options held by Canadian-
resident employees will reflect the application of paragraph 110(1)(d) of the
Tax Act, if applicable. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
deducted by the Buyer, the Company or the Shareholders Representative, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
