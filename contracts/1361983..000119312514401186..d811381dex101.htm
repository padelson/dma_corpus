any Subsidiary for any such period in the absence of the claiming of the maximum amount of any discretionary or other available deductions or loss carryforward balances available to it, then the Tax Returns for such corporation, as the case may be,
must be prepared on the basis that such corporation will claim such portion of the maximum amount of any discretionary deductions or loss carryforward balances available to it for that period that would result in the least amount of income taxes

right to review the Draft Return and any working papers relating to its preparation and to approve such Draft Return before any such Draft Return is filed with the relevant Governmental Authority. Within fifteen&nbsp;(15) days after the date that
the Shareholders&#146; Representative receives the Draft Return, the Shareholders&#146; Representative will advise the Buyer in writing that the Shareholders&#146; Representative either (i)&nbsp;agrees with the Draft Return so received by it, or
(ii)&nbsp;does not agree with the Draft Return so received by it, in which event the Shareholders&#146; Representative will set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement. If the Shareholders&#146; Representative notifies the Buyer

agreement, then the Buyer shall be entitled to file or cause to be filed such Tax Return in the manner that it so determines provided that (A)&nbsp;the Tax Return has been prepared in accordance with Section&nbsp;5.6(a) and such Tax Return is filed
or caused to be filed by the Buyer on or before the date on which it is required by Law to be filed with the applicable Governmental Authority and (B)&nbsp;the Shareholders shall not be liable for any Losses to the Buyer resulting directly or
