PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into as of June 30,

Danaher UK Industries Limited, a private limited company formed under the
laws of the United Kingdom ("Asset Seller 1"), Joslyn Canada, a
general partnership formed under the laws of the province of Ontario, Canada
("Asset Seller 2"), and Thomas and Betts Corporation, a Tennessee corporation
(the "Buyer"). The Parent, Asset Seller 1 and Asset Seller 2 are each
individually referred to herein as a "Seller" and are collectively referred
to herein as the "Sellers." The Sellers and the Buyer are each individually
referred to herein as a "Party" and are collectively referred to herein as
the "Parties."   INTRODUCTION    1. The Business Subsidiaries and the
Asset Sellers are engaged, among other businesses, in the Business.   2.
The Buyer desires to purchase from the Parent, and the Parent desires to sell
to the Buyer, the Membership Interests upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein.   3. The Buyer desires to purchase from
the Asset Sellers, and the Asset Sellers desire to sell to the Buyer, the
Acquired Assets, subject to the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.   4. Each
capitalized term used in this Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to it
in Article XI.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,
the Parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  MEMBERSHIP INTEREST AND ASSET
PURCHASE   1.1 Sale and Transfer of Membership Interests; Purchase and Sale
of Assets; Assumption of Liabilities.    (a) Sale and Transfer of
Membership Interests. On the basis of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Parent shall
sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall
purchase and acquire from the Parent, the Membership Interests.   (b)
Transfer of Assets. On the basis of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, each Asset
Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to the Buyer, and the
Buyer shall purchase and acquire from each Asset Seller, all of the Asset
Seller\'s right, title and interest in and to the Acquired
Assets.       (c) Assumed Liabilities. On the basis of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing, the Buyer shall assume and agree to pay, perform and discharge when
due the Assumed Liabilities.   (d) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement or any other writing to the contrary, the Buyer is assuming only
the Assumed Liabilities and is not assuming any Excluded Liability of any
Seller (or any predecessor of any Seller or any prior owner of all or part of
any Seller\'s business and assets), whether presently in existence or arising
hereafter. All Excluded liabilities shall be retained by and remain
obligations and liabilities of the Sellers.   1.2 Purchase Price and Related
Matters.   (a) Purchase Price. In consideration for the sale and
transfer of the Acquired Assets and the Membership Interests, at the Closing,
the Buyer shall assume the Assumed Liabilities as provided in Section 1.1(c)
and shall pay to the Sellers the Purchase Price in cash by wire transfers of
immediately available funds. The Purchase Price is subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 1.4.   (b) Allocation of Purchase Price. The Parent
shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer, within 60 days following the final
determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.4, a
schedule setting forth a proposed allocation of the Tax Purchase Price among
the assets of DPS, JTC and JHV (including the stock of FPC), the Acquired
Assets and the covenants contained in the Incidental Agreement. Such
allocation schedule will be prepared in a manner consistent with Schedule
1.2(b) attached hereto. If the Buyer does not deliver a written objection
within the 30-day period following the date of delivery of the Parent\'s
allocation schedule to the Buyer, then effective as of the close of business
on such 30th day (or upon the earlier delivery of notice by the Buyer to the
Parent that Buyer has accepted such allocation schedule), such allocation
schedule shall be deemed to be accepted by the Buyer. If the Buyer objects to
the Parent\'s schedule within such 30-day period and such objection is not
resolved by the Buyer and the Parent within 15 days following Buyer\'s notice
to the Parent of such objection, then the Buyer and the Parent shall jointly
engage the Neutral Accountant to resolve the dispute. The Neutral Accountant
shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator, and the Buyer and the Parent
agree to provide to the Neutral Accountant such information as the Neutral
Accountant may reasonably request in connection with its review. If
the Neutral Accountant determines that the allocation schedule provided by
the Parent was reasonable, such allocation schedule shall be final. If the
Neutral Accountant determines that the allocation schedule provided by the
Parent was unreasonable, the Neutral Accountant shall prepare the allocation
schedule based upon its assessment of the fair value of the assets of DPS,
JTC and JHV (including the stock of FPC), the Acquired Assets and the
covenants contained in the Incidental Agreement, and in a manner consistent
with Schedule 1.2(b). The Parent and the Buyer shall request that the Neutral
Accountant provide such allocation schedule as promptly as practicable. The
resolution by the Neutral Accountant of the matters set forth in this Section
1.2(b) shall be conclusive and binding upon the Buyer and the Parent. The
procedures set forth in this Section 1.2(b) shall be the sole and exclusive
method for resolving disputes with respect to the allocation of the Tax
Purchase Price; provided that this provision shall not prohibit either Party
from instituting litigation to enforce any ruling of the Neutral Accountant
in a court of competent jurisdiction determined in accordance with Section
12.12. The parties shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
allocation schedule as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.2(b).
The Buyer and the Parent shall share equally the fees and expenses of the
Neutral Accountant for its services under this Section 1.2(b).   2    
1.3 The Closing.   (a) Time and Location. The Closing shall take place at
the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP in Washington, DC
(or remotely by electronic exchange of documents and signatures), commencing
at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the Closing Date.   (b) Actions at the
Closing.   At the Closing:   (i) the Parent shall execute and deliver to
the Buyer an assignment with respect to the Membership Interests in

(ii) the Asset Sellers shall execute and deliver a Bill of Sale in

Exhibit C;   (iv) the Parent or one of its Affiliates (other than a
Business Subsidiary), as landlord, and JTC, as tenant, shall execute
and deliver the Lease Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as

attached hereto as Exhibit E;   (vi) the Parent and the Buyer shall execute
and deliver the Transition Services Agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit F;   (vii) the Buyer shall execute and deliver
to each Asset Seller an Assumption Agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit G;   (viii) Danaher Corporation shall execute
and deliver the Payment Guaranty in substantially the form attached hereto
as Exhibit H;   3     (ix) Sellers shall execute and deliver
the Incidental Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
I;   (x) for each Seller Guarantee existing as of the Closing, the Buyer
shall deliver to the Parent either (i) a copy of a replacement arrangement
obtained in accordance with Section 4.6, reasonably satisfactory to the
Sellers, or (ii) an irrevocable standby letter of credit in favor of the
Parent in an annual amount equal to the amount of such Seller Guarantee,
issued by a bank rated A or better by Standard and Poor\'s, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parent;   (xi) the Buyer shall
pay to the Sellers the Purchase Price in cash by wire transfers of
immediately available funds in accordance with the wire transfer instructions
delivered to the Buyer by the Sellers not less than 2 Business Days prior to
the Closing; and   (xii) the Parties shall execute and deliver to each
other a cross-receipt evidencing the transactions referred to above.   1.4
Post-Closing Adjustment. The Purchase Price set forth in  Section 1.2(a)
shall be subject to adjustment after the  Closing Date as follows:   (a)
Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause Russell Madera,
Controller of DPS, and Brad Lodge, Director of Finance of JHV, under the
supervision and direction of the Buyer, to prepare and deliver to the Parent,
on behalf of the Buyer, the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement shall be
prepared on a consistent basis with the accounting principles, practices,
procedures, policies and methods set forth on Schedule 1.4.   (b) The Parent
shall deliver to the Buyer, within 60 days after delivery on behalf of the
Buyer to the Parent of the Closing Statement, either a notice indicating that
the Parent accepts the Closing Statement or a statement describing the
Parent\'s objections to the Closing Statement, which statement of objections
shall describe in reasonable detail the nature and amount of the Parent\'s
objections. If the Parent does not object to the Closing Statement delivered
by the Buyer, the Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the
Parties.   (c) If the Parent objects to the Closing Statement and any such
objections are not resolved by the Parent and the Buyer within 90 days after
delivery to the Parent of the Closing Statement, the Buyer and the
Parent shall (A) jointly prepare and sign a statement setting forth (1)
those objections (if any) that the Buyer and the Parent have resolved and
the resolution of such objections and (2) those objections that remain
unresolved and (B) engage the Neutral Accountant to resolve such unresolved
objections. Each of the Buyer and the Parent shall provide to the Neutral
Accountant any information of such Party that the Neutral Accountant
reasonably requests for purposes of resolving such unresolved objections. The
Buyer and the Parent shall instruct the Neutral Accountant that (X) the scope
of its review and authority shall be limited to resolving such unresolved
objections, (Y) the Neutral Accountant shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, and (Z) the Neutral Accountant shall issue a ruling which sets
forth the resolution of each such unresolved objection and includes a
statement setting forth the Closing Working Capital Amount, reflecting the
Neutral Accountant\'s resolution of such unresolved objections. The
resolution by the Neutral Accountant of such unresolved objections and the
Closing Working Capital Amount prepared by the Neutral Accountant giving
effect thereto shall be conclusive and binding upon the Buyer and the
Sellers. The Buyer and the Sellers agree that the procedures set forth in
this Section 1.4(c) for resolving disputes with respect to the Closing
Statement shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any
such disputes; provided that this provision shall not prohibit any Party
from instituting litigation to enforce the determination of the Closing
Statement and the Closing Working Capital Amount by the Neutral Accountant in
a court of competent jurisdiction determined in accordance with Section
12.12. The Buyer and the Parent shall share equally the fees and expenses of
the Neutral Accountant for its services under this Section 1.4(c).   
4     (d) If the Target Working Capital Amount exceeds the
Closing Working Capital Amount as shown on the Final Closing Statement by
more than the Collar, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the difference between such excess and the Collar and the Parent shall pay
to the Buyer, by wire transfer or other delivery of immediately available
funds, within three Business Days after the date on which the Final Closing
Statement is finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.4, an amount equal
to such reduction in the Purchase Price (plus interest thereon at the rate of
2% per annum, compounded monthly, from the Closing Date). If the Closing
Working Capital Amount as shown on the Final Closing Statement exceeds the
Target Working Capital Amount by an amount greater than the Collar, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the difference
between such excess and the Collar and the Buyer shall pay to the Parent, by
wire transfer or other delivery of immediately available funds, within three
Business Days after the date on which the Final Closing Statement is finally
determined pursuant to this Section 1.4, an amount equal to such increase in
the Purchase Price (plus interest thereon at the rate of 2% per annum,
compounded monthly, from the Closing Date). If the absolute value of the
difference between the Closing Working Capital Amount and the Target Working
Capital Amount is less than or equal to the Collar, there shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price.   1.5 Consents to Assignment. Anything in
this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any contract, lease,
authorization, license or permit, or any claim, right or benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom, if (a) an attempted assignment or transfer
thereof, without the consent of a third party thereto or of the issuing
Governmental Entity, as the case may be, would constitute a breach thereof
and (b) such consent is not obtained. In such case, (x) such item shall be
withheld from sale pursuant to this Agreement without any reduction in the
Purchase Price, (y) from and after the Closing, the Asset Sellers and
the Buyer will cooperate, in all reasonable respects, to obtain such consent
as soon as practicable after the Closing, and (z) until such consent is
obtained, the Asset Sellers and the Buyer will cooperate, in all reasonable
respects, to provide to the Buyer the benefits under such item (with the
Buyer entitled to all the gains and responsible for all the losses, Taxes,
liabilities and/or obligations thereunder). In particular, in the event that
any such consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, then the Buyer and the
Asset Sellers shall enter into such arrangements (including, without
limitation, subleasing or subcontracting if permitted) to provide to the
Parties the economic and operational equivalent of obtaining such consent and
assigning or transferring such item, including, without limitation,
enforcement for the benefit of the Buyer of all claims or rights arising
thereunder, and the performance by the Buyer of the obligations thereunder on
a prompt and punctual basis.    5     1.6 Further Assurances. At any
time and from time to time after the Closing Date, as and when requested by
any Party hereto, the other Parties shall promptly execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents, instruments and
certificates and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further actions
as are necessary to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   ARTICLE II  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
SELLERS   The Sellers represent and warrant to the Buyer that the
statements contained in this Article II are true and correct as of the date
hereof, except as set forth in or reasonably ascertainable from the
Disclosure Documents. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure
Documents shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of
itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be
disclosed, is material to the Business, has resulted in or would result in a
Business Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the ordinary course of
business. The specification of any dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Article II is not intended to imply that such
amount, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not material for purposes of
this Agreement, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any
such amount in any dispute or controversy between or among the Parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included
in the Disclosure Documents is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.   2.1 Organization, Qualification and Power.   (a) The Sellers.
Each of the Sellers is a corporation, partnership or private limited company,
as applicable, duly organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly
qualified to conduct business under the laws of each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its activities, in each case as they relate exclusively to the Business,
makes such qualification necessary, except for any such failure to be
qualified that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Business
Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller has all requisite corporate, partnership
or private limited company power and authority, as applicable, to carry on
the business in which it is now engaged and to own and use the properties now
owned and used by it.   (b) The Business Subsidiaries. Each Business
Subsidiary is a limited liability company, corporation, or private limited
company, as applicable, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to
conduct business under the laws of each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification necessary, except for any such failure to
be qualified that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Business
Material Adverse Effect. Each Business Subsidiary has all requisite limited
liability company, corporate or private limited company power and authority,
as applicable, to carry on the business in which it is now engaged and to own
and use the properties now owned and used by it.   (c) Charter Documents.

charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company operating
agreement or other comparable governing documents of each Business Subsidiary
(each as amended to date). No Business Subsidiary is in default under or in
violation of any provision of its charter, bylaws, partnership agreement,
limited liability company operating agreement or other comparable governing
documents, as applicable.    6     2.2 Capitalization.   (a) All of
the Business Subsidiary Interests are owned of record and beneficially by the

Seller 1, as applicable, has good title to the Business Subsidiary Interests,
free and clear of any Security Interest, other than applicable securities law
restrictions.   (b) There are no outstanding or authorized options,
warrants, rights, agreements or commitments to which any Business Subsidiary
is a party or which are binding upon any Business Subsidiary providing for
the issuance, disposition or acquisition of any equity interests of any
Business Subsidiary. There are no outstanding or authorized equity

execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it
will be a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The
execution and delivery by each Seller of this Agreement and such Ancillary
Agreements and the consummation by each Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been validly authorized by all necessary
corporate, partnership or private limited company action, as applicable, on
the part of each Seller. This Agreement has been, and such Ancillary
Agreements will be, validly executed and delivered by each Seller and,
assuming this Agreement and each such Ancillary Agreement constitute the
valid and binding obligation of the Buyer, constitutes or will constitute a
valid and binding obligation of each Seller, enforceable against each Seller
in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally
and by equitable principles, including, without limitation, those limiting
the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief and other
equitable remedies and those providing for equitable defenses.   2.4
Noncontravention. Subject to compliance with the applicable requirements of
the Antitrust Laws and applicable Environmental Laws, neither the execution
and delivery by any Seller of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to
which such Seller will be a party, nor the consummation by any Seller of the

violate any provision of the charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited
liability company operating agreement or other comparable governing document,
as applicable, of such Business Subsidiary or such Seller;   (b) require on
the part of any Business Subsidiary or any Seller any filing with, or any
permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity,

Material Adverse Effect;    7     (c) conflict with, result in a breach

Seller is a party or by which any Business Subsidiary or any Seller is bound
or to which any of their respective assets is subject, except for (i) any
conflict, breach, default, acceleration or right to terminate or modify that
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Business Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) any notice, consent or waiver the absence of which would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Business Material Adverse Effect;
or   (d) violate any order, writ, injunction or decree specifically naming,
or statute, rule or regulation applicable to any Business Subsidiary or any
Seller or any of or their respective properties or assets, except for

Material Adverse Effect.   2.5 Financial Statements. The Disclosure

prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied throughout the periods
involved and fairly present, in all material respects, the financial

accordance with such methodologies; provided, however, the Financial

limitation, those relating to security clearance or export controls) or any
agreement to which it is a party or (B) cause the loss of the attorney-client
privilege with respect thereto. Prior to the Closing, the Buyer and its
representatives shall not contact or communicate with the employees,
customers and suppliers of any Asset Seller or any Business Subsidiary in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with
the prior written consent of the applicable Seller.   (b) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in any other provision of this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Buyer and the Sellers agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the Closing
or any termination of this Agreement and that any information provided by or
on behalf of any Seller or any of such Seller\'s Affiliates to the Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed Proprietary Information (as

Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, if the Closing occurs, the
Confidentiality Agreement, insofar as it covers information
relating exclusively to the Business, shall terminate effective as of the
Closing.   (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the Buyer and its representatives shall not have any access at
any time prior to the Closing to any information regarding pending or
proposed bids for new contracts or subcontracts or any related information
where the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer also has submitted or intends to
submit a bid for such contract or subcontract.    20     4.4
Disclosure Documents. From time to time between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall be entitled to provide to the Buyer
written updates to the Disclosure Documents, disclosing any events or
developments that occurred or any information learned between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date. The Sellers\' representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall be construed for all purposes of
this Agreement as being qualified and limited by the Disclosure Documents, as
so updated.   4.5 Elimination of Intercompany Items. Effective as of the
Closing, all payables, receivables, liabilities and other obligations between
the Business or any Business Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Business Subsidiaries), on the other
hand, shall be eliminated except to the extent (a) expressly provided for
herein or (b) such payables, receivables, liabilities and other obligations
relate to bona fide transactions entered into or conducted on substantially
prevailing market terms at substantially prevailing market prices.   4.6
Replacement of Guarantees and Letters of Credit. The Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to arrange, prior to the Closing,

respective Affiliates (other than the Business Subsidiaries)) with respect to
Seller Guarantees existing as of the Closing Date.   ARTICLE V  CONDITIONS

Article VI, from and after the Closing, the Parent shall indemnify the Buyer
in respect of, and hold the Buyer harmless against, Damages incurred
or suffered by the Buyer or any Affiliate thereof resulting from or
constituting:   (a) any breach of a representation or warranty of the

Certificate;   (b) any failure by any Seller to perform any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; or

Third-Party Claims. Except as set forth in Section 7.4(b), all claims for
indemnification made under this Agreement resulting from, related to or
arising out of a third-party claim against an Indemnified Party shall be made
in accordance with the following procedures. An Indemnified Party shall give
prompt written notification to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of
any action, suit or proceeding relating to a third-party claim for
which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any
such claim by a third party. Such notification shall include a description
in reasonable detail of the facts constituting the basis for such third-party
claim and the amount of the Damages claimed. At any time after delivery of
such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to
the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such action,
suit, proceeding or claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control
of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Party
not controlling such defense may participate therein at its own expense. The
Party controlling such defense shall keep the other Parties advised of the
status of such action, suit, proceeding or claim and the defense thereof and
shall have the right to settle such action, suit, proceeding or claim;
provided, however, (i) the Indemnified Party shall not agree to any
settlement of such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party
shall not agree to any settlement of such action, suit, proceeding or claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such
settlement does not impose equitable relief on the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates and includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates.    23     (b) Procedure for Claims. An Indemnified Party
wishing to assert a claim for indemnification under this Article VI shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice. Except to the extent
otherwise expressly stated in a written notice, if any, delivered by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have contested that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive any portion or all of the Damages claimed in such Claim
Notice or is otherwise entitled to indemnification with respect to the matter
described in the Claim Notice. If a dispute relating to a Claim Notice is not
resolved within 90 days following the delivery of the Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall each have the right to
submit such dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with
the provisions of Section 12.12.   6.4 Survival. The representations and
warranties of the Sellers and the Buyer set forth in this Agreement, the
Parent Certificate and the Buyer Certificate shall survive the Closing and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and continue until
the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date, at which time they shall
expire. If an indemnification claim is properly asserted in writing pursuant
to Section 6.3 prior to the expiration of the representation or warranty that
is the basis for such claim, then such representation or warranty shall
survive until, but only for the purpose of, the resolution of such claim.  
6.5 Limitations.   (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the following limitations shall apply to claims under this
Article VI or otherwise made with respect to this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement or the Parent Certificate:   (i) No individual claim shall be
valid and assertable against any Seller unless it is for an amount in excess
of US$25,000.00, and provided that such individual claims shall be applied
against the threshold amount set forth in Section 6.5(a)(ii).   (ii) No
Seller shall be liable with respect to any Damages except to the extent that
the aggregate amount of all Damages to which the Buyer has otherwise become
entitled under this Article VI exceeds one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the
Adjusted Purchase Price. All reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and reasonable costs of
investigation) paid by Buyer (or any Affiliate of Buyer) in connection with
any claims under this Article VI shall be considered Damages for purposes of
determining whether the threshold set forth in this Section 6.5(a)(ii) has
been exceeded, provided, however, no costs of investigation shall be
considered Damages pursuant to the foregoing clause unless the Buyer provides
the Parent with written notice of such investigation prior to the
commencement thereof and, upon Parent\'s reasonable request, apprises the
Parent of the status, findings and conclusions of such investigation.   
24     (iii) No Seller shall be liable with respect to any Damages to the
extent that such Damages, when aggregated with all other Damages to which the
Buyer has become entitled under this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, exceed US$28,000,000.00.   (iv) The amount
of any Damages to which the Buyer is entitled with respect to any claim shall
be calculated net of any adjustment to the Purchase Price made pursuant to
Section 1.4 and for any accruals, reserves or provisions therefor reflected
in the Final Closing Statement or the Financial Statements.   (v) The
amount of Damages recoverable by the Buyer under this Agreement shall be
reduced by (i) the amount of any payment receivable by the Buyer (or any
Affiliate thereof) with respect such Damages from any insurance provider or
any other third party (or that the Buyer or any of its Affiliates would have
been entitled to receive had the Buyer or its Affiliates maintained adequate
and customary insurance policies for the Business and the Business
Subsidiaries), and (ii) the amount of any Tax benefit realized or realizable
by the Buyer (or any Affiliate thereof) which is attributable to the Damages
to which such claim relates. For purposes of this Section 6.5(a)(v), the Tax
benefit realizable by the Buyer (or any Affiliate thereof) shall
be determined as of the date of the receipt of payment from Parent (or
any Affiliate thereof) by calculating the present value of all expected
reductions in Tax payments attributable to any expected deductions or
decreases in income associated with the Damages to which such claim relates,
assuming that the Buyer is always subject to a total combined Tax rate of 40%
and using a discount rate of 8% (compounded monthly). The Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue, and to cause its Affiliates to
pursue, all insurance claims, other third party payments and Tax benefits to
which it may be entitled in connection with any Damages it incurs. If the
Buyer (or an Affiliate) becomes entitled to receive any insurance or other
third party payment in connection with any claim for Damages for which it has
already received a payment from the Parent (or any Affiliate thereof), it
shall pay to the Parent, within 30 days after such payment becomes
receivable, an amount equal to the excess of (A) the amount previously
received by the Buyer from the Parent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect
to such claim plus the amount of such insurance or other third party payment,
over (B) the amount of Damages to which the Buyer has become entitled under
this Agreement in connection with such claim.   (vi) In no event shall any
Seller have any obligation or liability for:   (A) any Damages that are
consequential, in the nature of lost profits (including, without limitation,
loss of profit or revenue, any multiple of reduced cash flow or any
adjustment based on price to earnings or similar ratios), interference with
operations, or loss of customers, tenants, lenders, investors or buyers,
diminution in the value of property, special or punitive or otherwise not
actual out-of-pocket damages except to the extent arising in connection with
a third-party claim);    25     (B) any Damages arising from or
relating to, directly or indirectly, any matter disclosed in, or reasonably
ascertainable from, the Disclosure Documents or any other matter or facts
(including, without limitation, the breach or nonfulfillment of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement,
the Parent Certificate or any Ancillary Agreement) of which the Buyer has
knowledge on or before the Closing Date;   (C) any Damages arising from or
relating to, directly or indirectly, a breach that is remedied by or on
behalf of the Sellers or for which the Buyer receives compensation within a
reasonable period of time after the Sellers receive notice of such
breach;   (D) any Damages arising from or relating to, directly or
indirectly, any legislation or accounting principle not in force on the date
hereof (or any alteration or repeal of any legislation or
accounting principle in force on the date hereof), or which takes effect
retroactively, or occurs as a result of any increase in the rate of Tax in
force on the date hereof or any change in the practices of the relevant
Governmental Entity (including changes in the interpretation of relevant
legislation or accounting principles);   (E) any Damages arising from or
relating to, directly or indirectly, any act, omission or transaction carried
out by or at the request, or with the consent of, the Buyer or any Affiliate
thereof before, on or after the Closing Date, including, without limitation,
any change in the accounting policies, practices or procedures of the
Business or any of the Business Subsidiaries after the Closing;   (F) any
Damages that, at the time the claim alleging such Damages are notified to the
Sellers, are contingent or otherwise not capable of being quantified unless
(and solely to the extent) such Damages cease to be contingent and become
capable of being quantified prior to the date that is 36 months after the
Closing Date; or   (G) any Damages claimed in any Claim Notice received by
the Sellers more than 18 months after the Closing Date.   (vii) The Buyer
shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts
to pursue all legal rights and remedies available in order to minimize the
Damages to which it may be entitled under this Agreement.   (b) All costs
and expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and costs of
investigation) incurred by such Seller (or any Affiliate thereof) in
connection with the defense of third party claims under Section 6.3 shall,
solely for purposes of determining whether the cap set forth in
Section 6.5(a)(iii) has been exceeded, be considered Damages to which the
Buyer has become entitled under this Agreement or in connection with the
transaction contemplated hereby.   (c) Effective as of the Closing, the
Buyer hereby waives and releases (and shall cause each Business Subsidiary to
waive and release), any claim any Business Subsidiary may have against any
Seller or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date, except for claims that
directly relate to an inter-company item described in clause (b) of Section
4.5.    26     (d) From and after the Closing, except with respect to
(i) claims for equitable relief, including, without limitation,
specific performance, made with respect to breaches of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and (ii)
claims subject to resolution in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Sections 1.2(b) and 1.4, the rights provided to the Parties under this
Article VI shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties and their
respective Affiliates with respect to claims under this Agreement or
otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall any Party, its successors
or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (e) Warranty expenses ("RT
Warranty Expenses") reasonably paid by the Buyer as a result of any design or
manufacturing defect (existing prior to the date of the Closing) in the
discontinued radio product manufactured by Sellers\' Royce Thompson division
(the " RT Warranty Matter") shall be considered Damages solely for purposes
of determining whether the threshold in 6.5(a)(ii) has been exceeded, but (i)
solely to the extent that RT Warranty Expenses exceed, in the aggregate,
$335,000 and (ii) do not exceed, in the aggregate, $829,000. For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer is assuming all RT Warranty Expenses and all
liabilities related to the RT Warranty Matter and Sellers shall have
no obligation to indemnify Buyer for the RT Warranty Matter.   6.6
Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments made
under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
Adjusted Purchase Price.   ARTICLE VII  TAX MATTERS   7.1 Preparation and
Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.   (a) The Sellers shall be
responsible for the preparation and filing of (i) all Tax Returns of the
Sellers for all periods (including the consolidated, unitary and combined Tax
Returns for the Sellers which include the operations of the Business for any
period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date), (ii) all Tax
Returns for Income Taxes of any Business Subsidiary for all taxable periods
that end on or before the Closing Date, (iii) all Tax Returns for Income
Taxes of any Business Subsidiary for any period beginning before the Closing
Date and ending after the Closing Date and (iv) all other Tax Returns of any
Business Subsidiary that are required to be filed (taking into account
extensions) prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers shall make or cause to be
made all payments required with respect to any such Tax Returns. The Buyer
shall promptly reimburse the Sellers for the amount of any such Taxes paid by
the Sellers to the extent such Taxes are (i) Assumed Liabilities, (ii) Taxes
attributable (as determined under Section 7.2) to any of the Business
Subsidiaries, the Acquired Assets or the operations of the Business for
periods or portions thereof beginning after the Closing Date or
(iii) included in the Tax Reserves.   (b) The Buyer shall be responsible
for the preparation and filing of all other Tax Returns for the Business
Subsidiaries, the Acquired Assets, and the Business. The Buyer shall make all
payments required with respect to any such Tax Returns. Buyer shall promptly
reimburse Sellers to the extent that actual Taxes payable by Buyer for
periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date are less
than the amount of the Tax Reserves established for such Taxes.   
27     (c) The Buyer shall not cause or permit the filing of any amended
Tax Return with respect to any of the Business Subsidiaries for any period
ending on or before, or including, the Closing Date without the
Parent\'s consent.   (d) The Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of
any transfer, sales, use, stamp, conveyance, value added, recording,
registration, documentary, filing and other non-income Taxes and
administrative fees (including, without limitation, notary fees) arising in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (e) The Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any
and all Taxes attributable to the acts or omissions of the Buyer or the
Buyer\'s Affiliates occurring after the Closing.   (f) The Buyer shall not
make, or cause or permit to be made, an election under section 338 of the
Code with respect to the acquisition of the Share Capital or with respect to
FPC.   (g) The Buyer shall not cause or permit any Tax attribute (including
any Tax losses) of FPC arising in a period beginning after the Closing Date
to be carried back to a period ending on or before the Closing Date.   7.2
Allocation of Certain Taxes.   (a) The Buyer and the Sellers agree that if
any Business Subsidiary is permitted but not required under applicable
foreign, state or local Tax laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of
a taxable period, the Buyer and the Sellers shall treat such day as the last
day of a taxable period.   (b) In the case of any period that includes, but
does not end on, the Closing Date, Taxes attributable to the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined as follows: (A) real,
personal and intangible property Taxes of the Business Subsidiaries or that
relate to the Acquired Assets for the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date shall equal the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the total number of days in the period; and (B) any other Taxes for the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be computed as if the
period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date; provided that
any Taxes resulting from transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the
Closing other than in the ordinary course of business shall be attributed to
the portion of the period beginning after the Closing Date. Taxes for a
period that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date that are not
attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date pursuant
to the preceding sentence shall be attributable to the portion of the period
beginning after the Closing Date.    28     7.3 Refunds and
Carrybacks.   (a) The Sellers shall be entitled to any refunds
(including, without limitation, any interest paid thereon) or credits of
Taxes with respect to the Business Subsidiaries, the Acquired Assets or the
operations of Business attributable to taxable periods or portions thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date.   (b) The Buyer and/or its
Affiliates, as the case may be, shall be entitled to any refunds (including,
without limitation, any interest paid thereon) or credits of Taxes with
respect to the Business Subsidiaries, the Acquired Assets or the operations
of Business attributable to taxable periods, or portions thereof, beginning
after the Closing Date.   (c) The Buyer shall promptly forward to or
reimburse the Sellers for any such refunds (including, without limitation,
any interest paid thereon) or credits due the Sellers after receipt thereof,
and the Sellers shall promptly forward to the Buyer or reimburse the Buyer
for any such refunds (including, without limitation, any interest paid
thereon) or credits due the Buyer after receipt thereof.   7.4 Cooperation
on Tax Matters; Tax Audits.   (a) The Buyer and the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates shall cooperate in the preparation of all Tax Returns
for any Tax periods for which one Party could reasonably require the
assistance of the other Party in obtaining any necessary information. Such
cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, furnishing in a timely
manner any information within a Party\'s possession or subject to that
Party\'s control as may be reasonably requested by the Party filing such Tax
Returns. Such cooperation and information also shall include, but not be
limited to, provision of powers of attorney for the purpose of signing Tax
Returns and defending audits and promptly forwarding copies of appropriate
notices and forms or other communications received from or sent to any Taxing
Authority which relate to the Business Subsidiaries, the Acquired Assets or
the Business. The Buyer and the Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall
make their respective employees and facilities available on a mutually
convenient basis to explain any documents or information
provided hereunder.   (b) The Sellers shall have the right, at their own
expense, to control any Tax Audit, initiate any claim for refund, contest,
resolve and defend against any assessment, notice of deficiency, or other
adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to (i) any Taxes or Tax Returns of
any Seller, (ii) any Income Taxes or Tax Returns for Income Taxes of any
Business Subsidiary for any period beginning before the Closing Date, and
(iii) any other Taxes or Tax Returns of or relating to any Business
Subsidiary, the Acquired Assets or the operations of the Business with
respect to which the Sellers could have indemnification responsibility
hereunder. The Buyer shall have the right, at its own expense, to control any
other Tax Audit, initiate any other claim for refund, and contest, resolve
and defend against any other assessment, notice of deficiency, or other
adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to Taxes or Tax Returns with
respect to the Business Subsidiaries, the Acquired Assets or the operations
of the Business; provided that, with respect to any item the adjustment of
which may cause any Seller to become obligated to make any payment hereunder
or that could otherwise affect adversely the Taxes of any Seller, the Buyer
shall consult with the Sellers with respect to the resolution of any
such issue, and not settle any such issue, or file any amended Tax Return
relating to such issue, without the consent of the Sellers. This Section
7.4(b) rather than Section 6.3(a) shall govern with respect to the allocation
of responsibility for the conduct of Tax Audits, claims for Tax refunds, and
proceedings relating to assessments, notices of deficiency or other
adjustments or proposed adjustments relating to Taxes.    29     7.5
Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
arrangements with respect to or involving the Business shall be terminated
prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder
for amounts due in respect of periods ending on or before the Closing
Date.   7.6 Scope of Article VII. For the avoidance of doubt, any claim by
any Party relating to a breach by another Party of its obligations under
this Article VII shall be pursued in accordance with the procedures
for indemnification claims, and shall otherwise be subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations, set forth in Article VI.   ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION   8.1 Termination of Agreement. The Parties may terminate this
Agreement prior to the Closing as provided below:   (a) the Parties may
terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent;   (b) either the Buyer
or the Parent may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
other in the event that any Seller (in the case of a termination by the
Buyer) or the Buyer (in the case of a termination by the Parent) is in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement that would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 5.1(a) or Section 5.1(b) (in the case of a material breach by any
Seller) or the conditions set forth in Section 5.2(a) or 5.2(b) (in the case
of a material breach by the Buyer) not to be satisfied and (ii) is not cured
within 30 days following delivery of written notice of such breach by the
Buyer (in the case of a material breach by any Seller) or the Parent (in the
case of a material breach by the Buyer) to the other; and   (c) the Buyer or
the Parent may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other
if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before 60 days after the date
hereof by reason of the failure of (i) in the case of a termination by the
Buyer, any condition precedent under Section 5.1 (unless the failure results
from a breach by the Buyer of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement) or (ii) in the case of a termination
by the Parent, any condition precedent under Section 5.2 (unless the failure
results from a breach by any Seller of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement).   8.2 Effect of Termination. If
any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, except for
Article XI and Sections 4.3(b), 6.5, 12.1, 12.9, 12.11 and 12.12 (which
provisions shall survive any such termination), all obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to the
other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 6.5, termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any
Party from liability for any Damages resulting from fraudulent or willful
breach, prior to such termination, of any covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement.    30     ARTICLE IX  EMPLOYEE MATTERS   9.1 Offer
of Employment; Continuation of Employment. The Parties hereto intend that
there shall be continuity of employment with respect to all
Business Employees. The Buyer shall offer employment commencing on the
Closing Date to all Asset Seller Business Employees, including, without
limitation, those on vacation, military leave, leave of absence (whether paid
or unpaid), disability or layoff, on the terms set forth in Section 9.4.  
9.2 Cessation of Business Benefit Plan Participation; 401(k) Plan Matters.
Except as otherwise provided in this Article IX or as otherwise required by
applicable law, the Business Employees shall cease to participate in or
accrue further benefits under the Business Benefit Plans immediately prior
to the Closing, other than with respect to Business Benefit Plans maintained
solely with respect to Business Employees, and Sellers shall take (or cause
their ERISA Affiliates to take) all actions necessary to cease such
participation and accrual immediately prior to the Closing. Effective as of
the Closing, all Business Employees who participate in the Seller\'s 401(k)
Plan shall cease to participate in such plan. To the extent allowable under
Section 401(k) of the Code and regulations issued thereunder, Business
Employees shall be eligible to receive, at their election, a distribution of
their account balance from the Seller\'s 401(k) plan. Seller shall amend
Seller\'s 401(k) Plan (or shall cause its Affiliates to amend the appropriate
