<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October&nbsp;13, 2004 (this
&#147;Agreement&#148;), by and among Coventry Health Care, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(&#147;Parent&#148;), Coventry Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;), and First Health Group Corp., a Delaware
corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>RECITALS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of
the Company with and into Merger Sub (the &#147;Merger&#148;) upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the &#147;DGCL&#148;);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent
with their respective business strategies and is in the best interest of their
respective stockholders; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective

such later date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in
the Certificate of Merger, such specified date and time, being the &#147;Effective
Time&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Section&nbsp;1.3 </I>Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except

Merger Sub&#146;s Certificate of Incorporation (the &#147;Merger Sub Certificate&#148;) and

Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Section&nbsp;2.1 </I>Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Section&nbsp;2.1.1 </I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I> Conversion of Company Common Stock</I>. Each share of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (&#147;Company Common Stock&#148;) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares
of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1.2 and Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted, subject to this Section&nbsp;2.1.1 and Section&nbsp;2.2.5,
into the right to receive: (A)&nbsp;0.1791 shares (the &#147;Exchange Ratio&#148;) of common
stock, par value $.01 per share (&#147;Parent Common Stock&#148;), of Parent (the &#147;Stock
Consideration&#148;); and (B) $9.375 in cash (the &#147;Cash Consideration&#148;; and,
together with the Stock Consideration, as the same may be adjusted pursuant to
the last sentence of this Section&nbsp;2.1.1, the &#147;Merger Consideration&#148;). All such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
previously representing any such share shall thereafter represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration therefor. No fractional share of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued, and in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made
pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2.5 hereof. In the event that, at the time the Company
is first able to mail
the Proxy Statement to its stockholders (the &#147;Mailing Date&#148;), Parent shall
reasonably determine, after consultation with outside counsel, that the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration when
aggregated with the number of shares of Parent Common Stock which will be
subject to issuance with respect to Company Options pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.5
(excluding those Company Options which have become subject to Consents) (the
&#147;Issuances&#148;) will result in the Merger becoming subject to approval by the
stockholders of Parent pursuant to Rule&nbsp;312.03 of the New York Stock Exchange
(the &#147;Parent Approval Requirement&#148;), then Parent may, upon two Business Days
notice to the Company given within two Business Days after the Company notifies
Parent of its intent to mail the Proxy Statement, adjust the Cash Consideration
and the Stock Consideration as follows:

adopted by the Parent Board) to, and only to, such level that the
Issuances no longer result in the Parent Approval Requirement applying to
the Merger (Parent having so been advised by outside counsel), provided,
that the Exchange Ratio shall not be adjusted to a level that would

subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall

share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares,
the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares.

designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the &#147;Exchange
Agent&#148;), to act as agent for Parent for purposes of, among other things,
mailing and receiving letters of transmittal, and distributing cash and
certificates for Parent Common Stock to the Company&#146;s stockholders.

Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article&nbsp;2: (A)&nbsp;cash in U.S. dollars

Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which represent outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
&#147;Certificates&#148;) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (A)&nbsp;a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form) and (B)

surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with
such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and upon
surrender of such other documents as may be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor

to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2.3, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or

of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled

representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.2, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, cash

holder is entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2.5 and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2.3.

unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the share of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2.5, unless and until the holder

Agent shall so notify Parent and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional share
interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

complied with this Article&nbsp;2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment

Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2.5 and any

claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it

Exchange Agent. If withholding is required from shares of Parent Common Stock,
the Exchange Agent shall sell in the open market such shares of Parent Common
Stock on behalf of the former holder of Company Common Stock as is necessary to
satisfy such withholding obligation and shall pay such cash proceeds to the
appropriate Taxing authority.

a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, as the case may be. Each of the Company and
each Company Subsidiary has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified
or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Section&nbsp;3.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all of the subsidiaries of the
Company (each a &#147;Company Subsidiary&#148; and, collectively, the &#147;Company
Subsidiaries&#148;) and the state of incorporation or organization of such Company
Subsidiary and each jurisdiction in which such Company Subsidiary is qualified
or licensed to do business. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, each Company Subsidiary have been validly issued and
are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the
Company free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances or
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, &#147;Liens&#148;)
other than Liens created by federal or state securities laws, and free of any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other equity interests. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure

Interest in any other person.
