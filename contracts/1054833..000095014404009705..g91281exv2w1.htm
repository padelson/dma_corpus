 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 13, 2004 (this "Agreement"), by and among Coventry Health Care, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Coventry Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and First Health Group Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").   

RECITALS    

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL");   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent with their respective business strategies and is in the best interest of their respective stockholders; and   

 WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:   

Article 1. 
 The Merger    

 _Section 1.1 _The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").   

 _Section 1.2 _Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL (the date and time of such filing, or at such later date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger, such specified date and time, being the "Effective Time").   

 _Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the    ##### 

  

   

Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   

 _Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws. At the Effective Time, Merger Subs Certificate of Incorporation (the "Merger Sub Certificate") and By-laws (the "Merger Sub By-laws") shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.   

 _Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.   

Article 2. 
 Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates    

 _Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:   

 _Section 2.1.1 _ _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1.2 and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted, subject to this Section 2.1.1 and Section 2.2.5, into the right to receive: (A) 0.1791 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Parent Common Stock"), of Parent (the "Stock Consideration"); and (B) $9.375 in cash (the "Cash Consideration"; and, together with the Stock Consideration, as the same may be adjusted pursuant to the last sentence of this Section 2.1.1, the "Merger Consideration"). All such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such share shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor. No fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued, and in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 2.2.5 hereof. In the event that, at the time the Company is first able to mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders (the "Mailing Date"), Parent shall reasonably determine, after consultation with outside counsel, that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock included in the Merger Consideration when aggregated with the number of shares of Parent Common Stock which will be subject to issuance with respect to Company Options pursuant to Section 2.5 (excluding those Company Options which have become subject to Consents) (the "Issuances") will result in the Merger becoming subject to approval by the stockholders of Parent pursuant to Rule 312.03 of the New York Stock Exchange (the "Parent Approval Requirement"), then Parent may, upon two Business Days notice to the Company given within two Business Days after the Company notifies Parent of its intent to mail the Proxy Statement, adjust the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:    ##### 

  

   

 (a) The Exchange Ratio may be reduced (pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Parent Board) to, and only to, such level that the Issuances no longer result in the Parent Approval Requirement applying to the Merger (Parent having so been advised by outside counsel), provided, that the Exchange Ratio shall not be adjusted to a level that would result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2.3 or 6.3.3; and    

 (b) In such event, the Cash Consideration shall be increased to an amount such that the sum of (i) such adjusted Cash Consideration and (ii) the adjusted Exchange Ratio multiplied by $52.3365 equals $18.75.   

 _Section 2.1.2 _ _Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub, any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.   

 _Section 2.1.3 _ _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   

 _Section 2.1.4 _ _Change in Common Stock_. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.   

 _Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates.   

 _Section 2.2.1 _ _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate Mellon Investor Services, LLC, or another bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), to act as agent for Parent for purposes of, among other things, mailing and receiving letters of transmittal, and distributing cash and certificates for Parent Common Stock to the Companys stockholders.   

 _Section 2.2.2 _ _Exchange Fund and Exchange Procedures_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article 2: (A) cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the Cash Consideration, (B) certificates representing the Stock Consideration issuable pursuant to Section 2.1.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and (C) from time to time as needed, additional cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2.3 (such Cash Consideration and certificates representing the Stock Consideration, together with such additional cash    ##### 

  

   

consideration and such dividends or other distributions, being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which represent outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (the "Certificates") as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in customary form) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. On and following
the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed
and duly executed, and upon surrender of such other documents as may be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration or any other cash or other consideration payable to
holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3, may be paid to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2.3.   

 _Section 2.2.3 _ _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the share of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2.5, unless and until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of the Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.    ##### 

  

  

 _Section 2.2.4 _ _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and dividends or other distributions, in each case, issued or paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.   

 _Section 2.2.5 _ _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of such fractional share interests, Parent shall pay to each holder of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to (A) the fractional share interest of Parent Common Stock to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled, multiplied by (B) the average of the closing sales prices of Parent Common Stock on the Exchange, as reported in The Wall Street Journal for the twenty (20) consecutive Business Days in which shares are traded on the Exchange in the period ending on the second Business Day immediately prior to the date of the Effective Time (the "Average Closing Price"). As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional share interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.   

 _Section 2.2.6 _ _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3, in each case, without any interest thereon. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2.3 and all cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2.5) would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2.3 and all cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2.5 in respect thereof) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.   

 _Section 2.2.7 _ _No Liability_. Neither Parent, the Company, Merger Sub nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.    ##### 

  

  

 _Section 2.2.8 _ _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent only in obligations of, or obligations fully guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by, the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, provided that such obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and shall be paid to, Parent. Any losses resulting from such investments shall not in any way diminish Parents and Merger Subs obligation to pay the full amount of the Merger Consideration.   

 _Section 2.2.9 _ _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which such person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3, in each case, without interest thereon.   

 _Section 2.2.10 _ _Withholding_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. If withholding is required from shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall sell in the open market such shares of Parent Common Stock on behalf of the former holder of Company Common Stock as is necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation and shall pay such cash proceeds to the appropriate Taxing authority.   

 _Section 2.3 _Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time held by a holder who shall not have voted to adopt this Agreement and has the right to demand and has properly demanded payment for and an appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be due such holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to such payment or appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any such right to appraisal, each such share of such holder shall no longer be considered a Dissenting Share and shall be deemed to have converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3, in each case, in accordance with Section 2.1. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of    ##### 

  

   

any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common
Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or agree to
do or commit to do any of the foregoing except to the extent required by
applicable Law.   

 _Section 2.4 _Stock Transfer Books. At the close of business, New York time, on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.5 and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2.3.   

 _Section 2.5 _Stock Options.   

 _Section 2.5.1 _ At the Effective Time, all unexercised and unexpired options to purchase Company Common Stock ("Company Options") then outstanding, under any stock option plan of the Company, including the First Health Group Corp. 1995 Stock Option Plan, the First Health Group Corp. 1998 Stock Option Plan, the First Health Group Corp. 1998 Directors Stock Option Plan, the First Health Group Corp. 2000 Stock Option Plan, the First Health Group Corp. 2001 Stock Option Plan, and the First Amended and Restated First Health Group Corp. 2001 Directors Stock Option Plan, as amended, or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (the "Company Stock Option Plans"), whether or not then exercisable, will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Company Stock Option Plan and any agreements thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Company Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by 0.3583 (the "Option Exchange Ratio"), rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole cent; _provided, that_ the conversion of any Company Options which are incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code into options to purchase Parent Common Stock shall be made so as not to constitute a "modification" of such Company Options within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code. Continuous employment with the    ##### 

  

   

Company or its subsidiaries shall be credited to the optionee for purposes
of determining the vesting of all assumed Company Options after the
Effective Time.   

 _Section 2.5.2 _ Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the consent of each holder ("Consents") of Company Options outstanding to cancel his or her Company Options (whether or not then exercisable) effective as of the Effective Time, in exchange for a single lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (whether or not then exercisable) immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the greater of (A) the excess, if any, of $18.75 over the exercise price per share of such Company Option and (B) $1.25. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Consents on or prior to the Mailing Date, but notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the failure to obtain any or all of such consents shall not result in a failure of a condition to Closing (including Section 6.2.2 hereof).   

Article 3. 
 Representations and Warranties of the Company    

 Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), or as set forth in the Company SEC Filings, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:   

 _Section 3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all of the subsidiaries of the Company (each a "Company Subsidiary" and, collectively, the "Company Subsidiaries") and the state of incorporation or organization of such Company Subsidiary and each jurisdiction in which such Company Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do business. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Company Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens") other than Liens created by federal or state securities laws, and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity interests. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary holds an Equity Interest in any other person.    #####

The Company has made available, or will make available to Parent upon request of Parent at the Companys executive offices, complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) of each of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement, and the minute books of each Company Subsidiary. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the minute books of the Company, provided that the minutes contained therein have been redacted to remove competitively sensitive pricing or other information and records of proceedings of the Company Board and any committee thereof with respect to the process (and alternatives thereto) that resulted in this Agreement.

As of the date hereof, no shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding.   

 _Section 3.3.2 _ The Company has delivered to Parent a correct and complete list, as of October 7, 2004, of all outstanding Company Stock Options, restricted stock awards and other rights to purchase or receive shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Option Plans or otherwise, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto, whether or not a stock option is an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, the expiration dates and the exercise prices thereof, in each case broken down as to each plan, agreement or other arrangement and as to each individual holder. As of October 7, 2004, except for (A) Company Options to purchase not more than 10,955,376 shares of Company Common Stock and (B) other arrangements and agreements set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no options, warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock or other Equity Interests from the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock or other Equity Interests. Since October 7, 2004 through the date hereof, the Company has not issued any shares of its capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities (other than Company Options issued in the ordinary course of business) convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock or other Equity Interests, other than shares of capital stock reserved for issuance as provided in this Section 3.3, issuance of shares pursuant to Company Options, or as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule. All shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance under the Company Stock Option Plans, upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which    ##### 

  

   

they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote.   

 _Section 3.4 _Authority.   

 _Section 3.4.1 _ The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholders, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated by the Company. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company and no stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Merger or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby subject, with respect to the Merger, to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholders. This Agreement has been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).   

 _Section 3.4.2 _ The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has adopted resolutions (i) declaring that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders, (ii) approving and adopting this Agreement and the Merger, (iii) directing that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company and (iv) recommending that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.17, the action of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") in approving this Agreement and the Merger is sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the Merger the restrictions on business combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL. To the knowledge of the Company after due inquiry, no other "fair price", "merger moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation applies to this Agreement or the Merger.    #####

subject to compliance with Section 5.7, the Company may adjourn or postpone

 _Section 5.7.1 _ From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any Company Subsidiary or Company Representative to, directly or indirectly, take any action to (A) solicit, initiate or facilitate any    #####

permitted to:    

 (i) take and disclose to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to any tender or exchange offer by a third party or amend or withdraw such a position in accordance with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act;    

 (ii) if the Company has received an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal from a third party made after the date hereof and the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, change the Company Recommendation or enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"); _provided_ , that the Company shall comply with Section 5.7.2 hereof prior to making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;

Parent that the Company Board intends to make such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, which notice shall contain a copy of the Superior
Proposal to which such Company Adverse Recommendation Change relates and the
information required to be provided to Parent by Section 5.7.3 in connection
with such Superior Proposal, together with copies of any written offer or
proposal in respect of such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that
any amendment to the material terms of such Superior Proposal after the
initial Adverse Recommendation Notice shall require a new Adverse
Recommendation Notice. In determining whether to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board
shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent (in response to an Adverse Recommendation Notice or otherwise) in
determining whether such third party Acquisition Proposal still constitutes a
Superior Proposal.   

 _Section 5.7.3 _ The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information, proposal or other inquiry that is, or is reasonably likely to result in, an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry (including any changes to the material terms thereof) and the identity of the person making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
furnish to the other party all information necessary for any such application
or other filing to be made in connection with the Merger or other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly inform the other of any communication with, and any proposed
understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Entity

independently participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry, then such party
shall give the other party reasonable prior notice of such meeting. The
parties shall coordinate and cooperate with one another in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party in
connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or relating to
any such application or filing.   

 _Section 5.8.2 _ The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents, (A) necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (B) required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, or (C) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time or a Parent Material Adverse Effect from occurring after the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that the Company and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Company Contracts in connection with consummation of the Merger and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. In the event that either party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described in the first sentence of this Section 5.8.2, such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to mitigate any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.   

 _Section 5.8.3 _ From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other in writing of any pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or the Company (as the case may be), threatened action, suit, arbitration or other proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Entity or any other Person (A) challenging or seeking material damages in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or otherwise limit in any material respect the right of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to own or operate all or any portion of the businesses or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.   

 _Section 5.8.4 _ Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the expiration of the notice periods under or with respect to the HSR Act, the Other Regulatory Approvals and any other Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement and (B) resolve such objections, if    ##### 

  

   

any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger
or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In connection
therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law, each of
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to,
cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to contest and resist, except
insofar as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree, any such action or
proceeding, including any action or proceeding that seeks a temporary
restraining order or preliminary injunction that would prohibit, prevent or
restrict consummation of the Merger or other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent
shall cooperate in good faith with all Governmental Entities and, subject to
Section 5.10, undertake promptly any and all actions required to lawfully
complete the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   

 _Section 5.8.5 _ Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will, and will cause each of its Representatives to, use its reasonable efforts, subject to applicable Laws, to cooperate with and assist Parent and Merger Sub in connection with planning the integration of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective employees with the business operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries.   

 _Section 5.8.6 _ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Company shall exercise, subject and consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section 5.2, complete unilateral control and supervision over its business operations.   

 _Section 5.9 _Certain Notices.

 _Section 5.10_ Reasonable Best Efforts. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, no covenant in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent to (A) agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any assets or any portion of any business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of business, (C) restrict the manner in which, or whether, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates may carry on business in any part of the world or (D) agree to any terms or conditions that would impose any obligations on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming the consummation of the Merger, the Company or any of the    ##### 

  

   

Company Subsidiaries, to maintain facilities, operations, places of business,
employment levels, products or businesses, which, in the case of any of
clauses (A) through (D), would have, or would be reasonably likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii)

sought to be derived by Parent from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger.

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) that are treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is identified on the Company Disclosure Schedules.   

 _Section 5.13.2 _ From and after the Effective Time, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will, and Parent will cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to, honor, in accordance with their terms, all individual employment, severance and change of control agreements between the Company and any Company Employee    ##### 

  

   

including, without limitation, bonuses, incentives or deferred compensation
in existence on the date hereof. Parent acknowledges that consummation of the
Merger shall constitute a "Change of Control" as defined in such
agreements.   

 _Section 5.13.3 _ From and after the Effective Time, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will, and Parent will cause the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Company Benefit Plans to, provide or pay when due to the Company Employees all benefits and compensation pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans, programs and arrangements in effect on the date hereof earned or accrued through, and to which such individuals are entitled as of, the Effective Time (or such later time as such Company Benefit Plans as in effect at the Effective Time are terminated or canceled by the Surviving Corporation subject to compliance with this Section 5.13).   

 _Section 5.13.4 _ For a period of two years after the Effective Time, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will, and Parent will cause the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to, either (i) maintain the compensation and benefits that are currently available to the Company Employees under the Company Benefit Plans or (ii) provide to the Company Employees compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits that are provided to similarly situated employees of the Parent.   

 _Section 5.13.5 _ As soon as practicable, but not later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Company Options assumed by Parent at the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.5.   

 _Section 5.13.6 _ Nothing in this Agreement shall require the continued employment of any person, and, except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.13, no provision of this Agreement shall prevent Parent or Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan.   

 _Section 5.14_ Indemnification of Directors and Officers.   

 _Section 5.14.1 _ For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and employees of the Company ("Covered Persons") to the same extent such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company Certificate, the Company By-laws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any Covered Persons for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless such persons to the fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Covered Person shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect to any matters subject to indemnification hereunder, _provided_ that, to the extent then required by the DGCL, any person to whom expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such advanced expenses if it is ultimately determined that such    ##### 

  

   

person is not entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any
Covered Person with respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder
on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of
this Section 5.14 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.   

 _Section 5.14.2 _ The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of Covered Persons than are currently set forth in the Company Certificate and the Company By-laws. Any indemnification agreements with Covered Persons in existence on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without any further action, and shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.   

 _Section 5.14.3 _ For six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide to the Companys current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring on or before the Effective Time ("DandO Insurance") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such maximum amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this Section 5.14.3, which policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of at least six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. The obligations under this Section 5.14.3 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to affect adversely any indemnitee to whom this Section 5.14.3 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this Section 5.14.3 applies and their respective heirs, successors and assigns shall be express third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.14.3).   

 _Section 5.14.4 _ In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (A) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.14.   

 _Section 5.15_ Plan of Reorganization. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). Each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not    ##### 

  

   

knowingly take any actions or cause any actions to be taken which could
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   

 _Section 5.16 _ Affiliate Letters. The Company shall, within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof, deliver to Parent a list (reasonably satisfactory to counsel for Parent) setting forth the names of all persons who are expected to be, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall furnish such information and documents as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the list. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each person who is identified as an affiliate in the list furnished or supplemented pursuant to this Section 5.16 to execute a written agreement, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, in substantially the form of Exhibit 5.16-A hereto.   

 _Section 5.17 _ Standstill Agreements. During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company will not release or permit the release of any person from, or waive or permit the waiver of, and the Company will use its reasonable efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced, any "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, except that the Company shall be permitted to release or permit the release of such person from any standstill obligation if the Company Board takes such action in the course of exercising its rights under Section 5.7.   

 _Section 5.18 _ Letters of the Accountants.   

 _Section 5.18.1 _ The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a letter from the Companys independent accountants dated a date on or prior to (but no more than two (2) business days prior to) the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective addressed to Parent and the Company, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement; provided that the failure of such a letter to be delivered by the Companys independent accountants shall not result in a failure of a condition to Closing (including Section 6.2.2 hereof).   

 _Section 5.18.2 _ Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company a letter from Parents independent accountants dated a date on or prior to (but no more than two (2) business days prior to) the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective addressed to the Company and Parent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement; provided that the failure of such a letter to be delivered by Parents independent accountants shall not result in a failure of a condition to Closing (including Section 6.3.2 hereof).   

 _Section 5.19 _ Consents. During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company will not release or permit the release of any person from, or waive or permit the waiver of, and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to    ##### 

  

   

enforce or cause to be enforced, the Consents obtained on or before the date
hereof from the persons identified on Schedule 5.19 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 _Section 8.6 _Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   

 _Section 8.7 _Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.   

 _Section 8.8 _Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent and Company Disclosure Schedules and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto), and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder.   

 _Section 8.9 _Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise and any purported assignment hereof shall be null and void.   

 _Section 8.10 _Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than pursuant to Section 5.13, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.    ##### 

  

  

 _Section 8.11 _Mutual Drafting. Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties.   

 _Section 8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury.   

 _Section 8.12.1 _ This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without regard to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles.   

 _Section 8.12.2 _ Each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (A) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (B) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, (C) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and (D) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 8.3. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.   

 _Section 8.12.3 _ EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.12.3.    ##### 

  

  

 _Section 8.13 _Disclosure. Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of the Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth in any other section of the Disclosure Schedule so long as its relevance to the latter section of the Disclosure Schedule or section of the Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule to the person to which such disclosure is being made. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.   

 _Section 8.14 _Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.   

 _Section 8.15 _Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
