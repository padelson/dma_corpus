financings provided for under the Commitment Letter and the Equity
Commitment Letter and, upon breach, will enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter. 

  

(3) The Purchaser shall keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to
all material activity concerning the status of the financings referred to in
this Section 5.2 and shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware
of any material change with respect to any such financings. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser agrees to notify the
Company promptly if at any time prior to the Effective Time: (a) the
Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter shall expire or be
terminated for any reason; (b) any event occurs that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would individually or in the aggregate, constitute a
default or breach on the part of the Purchaser under any material term or
condition of the Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter or any
other definitive agreement or documentation referred to in this Section 5.2
or if the Purchaser has any reason to believe that it shall be unable
to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition of any financing
referred to in this Section 5.2 to be satisfied by it, that in each case
would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of the Purchaser to
consummate the financings; or (c) the financing source that is a party to
the Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter advises the Purchaser
or any Purchaser Party, whether orally or in writing, that such source (and,
in the case of the Commitment Letter, other sources to whom the financing
commitment under the Commitment Letter may have been syndicated) either no
longer intend(s) to provide or underwrite any financing referred to in this
Section 5.2 on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter or the Equity
Commitment Letter, as applicable, or request(s) amendments or waivers thereto
that are or could reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the
timely completion by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. 

  

(4) Other than in connection with and as contemplated in this Agreement, the
Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, take
any action or enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition,
joint venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financings,
that would reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent the
Purchaser obtaining the financing contemplated by this Section 5.2. 

  

(5) The Purchaser shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, the
Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter or any other definitive
agreement or documentation referred to in this Section 5.2 in any manner that
would reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case
without the prior written consent of the Company. 

  

(6) If the Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter is terminated or
modified in a manner materially adverse to the Purchasers ability to
complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any reason, the
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (a) obtain, as promptly
as practicable, and, once obtained, provide the Company with a copy of, one or
more new financing commitments in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not subject to any condition
precedent materially less favourable from the perspective of the Company than
the conditions precedent contained in the Commitment Letter and/or the
Equity Commitment Letter, as the case may be, (provided that the Purchaser
shall not be required to use reasonable best efforts to obtain any
commitments that are on terms less favourable to the Purchaser (as determined
in the reasonable judgment of the Purchaser) than those in the
Commitment Letter and/or the Equity Commitment Letter); (b) negotiate and
enter into definitive credit, loan or other agreements and all required
documentation with such third parties as may be necessary for the Purchaser
to obtain such funds on terms and conditions consistent with such new
financing commitments, as soon as reasonably 

   ##### 

  

    

practicable but in any event prior to the Outside Date, and deliver to the
Company correct and complete copies of such executed definitive agreements
and documentation promptly when available; (c) satisfy, on a timely basis, in
all material respects all covenants, terms, representations and warranties
and conditions applicable to the Purchaser in respect of such new financing
commitments and all other required agreements and documentation referred to
in this Section 5.2 and enforce its rights under such new financing
commitments and agreements and documentation; and (d) obtain funds under such
commitments to the extent necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Any such replacement commitments shall be
deemed to constitute the Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter,
as applicable, for the purposes of Section 7.8 and this Section 5.2. 

  

(7) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that its obtaining financing is not
a condition to any of its obligations hereunder, regardless of the reasons
why financing is not obtained or whether such reasons are within or beyond
the control of the Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, if any financing
referred to in this Section 5.2 is not obtained, the Purchaser shall continue
to be obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject to and on the terms contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

5.3 Mutual Covenants 

   

(1) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser and

(including the Contracts set forth in Schedule 6.2(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter) in full force and effect following completion of the
Arrangement, in each case on terms that are reasonably satisfactory to the
Purchaser, and without paying, and without committing itself or the Purchaser
to pay, any consideration or incur any liability or obligation to or in
respect of any such other party without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser;  
      
    | (d)  |   | opposing any injunction or restraining or other order
seeking to stop, or otherwise adversely affecting each of its ability to
consummate, the Arrangement and defending, or causing to be defended, any
Proceedings to which it is a party or brought against it or its directors or
officers challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Arrangement
and the transactions contemplated hereby;  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (e)  |   | using, and, in the case of the Company, causing
its subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to satisfy (or cause the
satisfaction of) the conditions precedent to its obligations hereunder as set
forth in Article VI to the extent the same is within its control and to take,
or cause to be taken, all other action and to do, or cause to be done, all
other things necessary, proper or advisable under all applicable Laws to
consummate the Arrangement;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (f)  |   | carrying out the terms of the Interim Order and the
Final Order applicable to it and complying promptly with all requirements
which applicable Laws may impose on it or its subsidiaries or affiliates with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby; and  
      
    | (g)  |   | not taking any action, or permitting any action to be
taken or commercially reasonable action to not be taken, which is
inconsistent with this Agreement or which would reasonably be expected to
significantly impede the completion of the Arrangement or to prevent
or materially delay the completion of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement (including the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article VI) or any Regulatory Approval, in each case, except as specifically
permitted by this Agreement.  
   

  

(2) The Parties shall cooperate in the preparation of any application for the
Regulatory Approvals and any other orders, clearances, consents, rulings,
exemptions, no-action letters and approvals reasonably deemed by either the
Purchaser or the Company to be necessary to discharge their respective
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise advisable under applicable Laws
in connection with the Arrangement and this Agreement. In connection with the
foregoing, each Party shall furnish, on a timely basis, all information as
may be reasonably required by the other Party or by any Governmental Entity
to effectuate the foregoing actions, and each covenants that, to
its knowledge, no information so furnished by it in writing shall contain a
misrepresentation. 

  

(3) The Parties shall consult with, and consider in good faith any suggestions
or comments made by, the other Party with respect to the documentation
relating to the Regulatory Approvals process, provided that, to the extent
any such document contains any information or disclosure relating to a Party
or any affiliate of a Party, such Party shall have approved such information
or disclosure prior to the submission or filing of any such document (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

(4) Subject to applicable Laws, the Parties shall cooperate with and keep each
other fully informed as to the status of and the processes and proceedings
relating to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, and shall promptly notify
each other of any communication from any Governmental Entity in respect of
the Arrangement or this Agreement, and shall not make any submissions or
filings, participate in any meetings or any material conversations with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigations or other
inquiries related to the Arrangement or this Agreement unless it consults
with the other Party in advance and, to the extent not precluded by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to review
drafts of any submissions or filings, or attend and participate in any
communications or meetings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, submissions,
filings or other written communications with any Governmental Entity may
be redacted as necessary before sharing with the other Party to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns,
provided that external legal counsel to the Purchaser and the Company shall
receive non-redacted versions of drafts or final submissions, filings
or other written communications to any Governmental Entity on the basis that
the redacted information shall not be shared with their respective clients.
The Parties shall request that the Regulatory Approvals be processed by the
applicable Governmental Entity on an expedited basis and, to the extent that
a public hearing is held, the Parties shall request the earliest possible
hearing date for the consideration of the Regulatory Approvals. 

   ##### 

  

  

(5) Each of the Purchaser and the Company shall promptly notify the other if
at any time before the Effective Time it becomes aware that: 

  

       | (a)  |   | any application for a Regulatory Approval or
other filing under applicable Laws made in connection with this Agreement,
the Arrangement or the transactions contemplated herein contains a
misrepresentation; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | any Regulatory Approval or other order, clearance,
consent, ruling, exemption, no-action letter or other approval applied for as
contemplated herein which has been obtained contains or reflects or was
obtained following submission of any application, filing, document or
submission as contemplated herein that contained a misrepresentation,  
   

  

such that an amendment or supplement to such application, filing, document or
submission or order, clearance, consent, ruling, exemption, no-action letter
or approval may be necessary or advisable. In such case, the Parties shall
cooperate in the preparation of such amendment or supplement as required. 

  

(6) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
under any applicable Law, or if any proceeding is instituted or threatened by
any Governmental Entity challenging or which could lead to a challenge of any
of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of or not in compliance
with the requirements of any applicable Law, the Parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts consistent with the terms hereof to resolve such
proceeding so as to allow the Effective Time to occur on or prior to the
Outside Date. 

  

(7) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in exercising its
reasonable best efforts, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause its affiliates
to, take any and all steps necessary to obtain the Key Non-Transportation
Regulatory Approvals as promptly as practicable including agreeing in respect
of any of the businesses, properties, assets, operations, rights or interests
of the Purchaser Parties and their subsidiaries and affiliates (including any

divestitures, licensing, hold separate or similar arrangements with respect

existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations; (c) to commit

adverse decision or order by any Governmental Entity or, if requested by the
Company, to commence or defend, or threaten to commence or defend, and to
pursue vigorously litigation reasonably believed by the Company to be helpful
in obtaining authorization from Governmental Entities or in terminating any
outstanding Proceedings to enable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; it being understood that the costs and expenses of all
such legal actions shall be borne by the Purchaser. 

  

5.4 Public Communications 

   

Subject to Section 2.4, none of the Company or the Purchaser Parties shall,
and each shall cause its respective representatives not to, issue any press
release or otherwise make any disclosure relating to this Agreement or the
Arrangement without the consent of the Parties hereto (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , however,
that the foregoing shall be subject to the Companys overriding obligation to
make any disclosure or filing required under applicable Laws, and in such
circumstances the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to give prior
oral or written

notice to the Purchaser Parties and reasonable opportunity for the Purchaser
Parties and its legal counsel to review or comment on the disclosure or
filing (other than with respect to confidential information contained in such

failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the earlier to occur
of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time of any event or
state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be likely to: 

   

       | (a)  |   | cause any of the representations or warranties of
such Party contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect on the date hereof or at the Effective Time; or  
---|---|---|---

delivering such notice is asserting as the basis for the termination right.
If any such notice is delivered, provided that a Party is proceeding
diligently to cure such matter and such matter is reasonably capable of being
cured (except matters arising out of the failure 

  ##### 

  

   

to make appropriate disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter), no Party may
exercise such termination right until the earlier of (a) the Outside Date and
(b) the date that is 30 days following receipt of such notice by the Party to
whom the notice was delivered, if such matter has not been cured by such
date. If such notice has been delivered prior to the date of the

     7.2  |   | Non-Solicitation  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(1) Except as expressly provided in this Section 7.2, the Company shall not,
directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee,
representative (including any financial or other advisor) or agent of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, "Representatives"): (a)
solicit, facilitate, knowingly encourage or initiate any inquiries
or proposals regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (b) encourage or participate
in any discussions or negotiations, including by furnishing any information
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affording access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or its
subsidiaries, with any person (other than the Purchaser Parties) regarding
an Acquisition Proposal; (c) make a Change in Recommendation; (d) accept,
approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to accept, approve,
endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that
publicly taking no position or a neutral position with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal for a period of no more than ten days following the
formal announcement of such Acquisition Proposal shall not be considered to
be in violation of this Section 7.2(1)); or (e) accept, approve, endorse,
recommend or enter into, or publicly propose to accept, approve, endorse,
recommend or enter into, any Contract in respect of an Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality and standstill agreement permitted by Section
7.2(3)). 

  

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.2, the Company shall, and
shall cause its subsidiaries and Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or
negotiation with any persons conducted heretofore by the Company,
its subsidiaries or any Representatives with respect to any actual or
potential Acquisition Proposal, and, in connection therewith, the Company
shall discontinue access to the Data Room (and not establish or allow access
to any other data rooms, virtual or otherwise or otherwise
furnish information) and shall as soon as possible request, to the extent
that it is entitled to do so (and exercise all rights it has to require) the
return or destruction of all confidential information regarding the Company
and its subsidiaries previously provided to any such person or any
other person and shall request (and exercise all rights it has to require)
the destruction of all material including or incorporating or otherwise
reflecting any material confidential information regarding the Company and
its subsidiaries. The Company agrees that neither it, nor any of
its subsidiaries, shall terminate, waive, amend or modify, and agrees to
actively prosecute and enforce, any agreement containing standstill
provisions and any provision of any existing confidentiality agreement or any
standstill agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party
(except to allow the person party to such provisions or agreement to privately
propose an Acquisition Proposal to the Company and except that the Purchaser
acknowledges that the automatic termination of the standstill provisions of
such agreements as a result of the entering into and announcement of this
Agreement shall not be a violation of this Section 7.2(2)); _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not prevent the Board of 

  ##### 

  

   

Directors from considering and accepting any new Acquisition Proposal that is
determined to be a Superior Proposal that might be made by any such person,
provided that the remaining provisions of this Section 7.2 are complied with. 
 

  

(3) Notwithstanding Section 7.2(1), Section 7.2(2) and any other provision of
this Agreement, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior
to obtaining the approval of the Arrangement Resolution by the Shareholders
at the Company Meeting, the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal
not resulting from a breach of this Section 7.2 that the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal advisors, constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to constitute a Superior Proposal, then the Company may, following
compliance with Section 7.2(4): 

   

       | (a)  |   | furnish information with respect to the Company
and its subsidiaries to the person making such Acquisition Proposal; and/or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | enter into, participate, facilitate and maintain
discussions or negotiations with, and otherwise cooperate with or assist, the
person making such Acquisition Proposal;  
   

 

 _provided_ that the Company shall not, and shall not allow its
Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such person
without having entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement with
such person that contains provisions that are no less favourable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement except that
such agreement need not restrict the ability of such person to privately
propose an Acquisition Proposal to the Company (a correct and complete copy
of which confidentiality and standstill agreement shall be provided to the
Purchaser before any such non-public information is provided), provided that
such confidentiality and standstill agreement may not include any provision
calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and may not
restrict the Company or its subsidiaries from complying with this
Section 7.2, and shall promptly provide to the Purchaser any material non-
public information concerning the Company or its subsidiaries provided to
such other person which was not previously provided to the Purchaser. 

  

(4) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours following
receipt) notify the Purchaser (at first orally and thereafter in writing) in
the event it receives after the date hereof an Acquisition Proposal
(including any request for non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of
the Company or its subsidiaries, in each case, in connection with a potential
Acquisition Proposal), including the material terms and conditions thereof
(including the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal), and
shall regularly and promptly inform the Purchaser in writing as to the status
of developments and negotiations with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,
including any changes to the material terms or conditions, of such
Acquisition Proposal. 

  

(5) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time
following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the approval of
the Arrangement Resolution by the Shareholders at the Company Meeting, the
Company receives an Acquisition Proposal not resulting from a breach of this
Section 7.2 that the Board of Directors concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, constitutes
a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors may, subject to compliance with
the procedures set forth in Section 8.1(1)(d)(i), authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement and contemporaneously enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal advisors,
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, if and only if: 

    ##### 

  

     

       | (a)  |   | it has provided the Purchaser with a copy of the
Superior Proposal document, together with any financing documents supplied to
the Company in connection therewith, and written confirmation from the
Company that the Board of Directors has determined that the
proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and 
  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | five business days (the "Matching Period") shall have
elapsed from the date that is the later of (i) the date the Purchaser
received written notice advising the Purchaser that the Board of Directors
has resolved, subject only to compliance with this Section 7.2, to terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal and (ii) the date the Purchaser has received all of the
materials set forth in Section 7.2(5)(a), (it being understood that the
Company shall promptly inform the Purchaser of any amendment to the financial
or other material terms of such Superior Proposal during such period).  
   

 

(6) During the Matching Period, the Company agrees that the Purchaser shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this
Agreement. The Board of Directors shall review any offer by the Purchaser to
amend the terms of this Agreement in good faith in order to determine, in its
discretion in the exercise of its fiduciary duties and in consultation with
its financial and outside legal advisors, whether the Purchasers amended
offer, upon acceptance by the Company would cause the Superior Proposal
giving rise to the Matching Period to cease to be a Superior Proposal. If the
Board of Directors so determines, the Company shall enter into an
amended agreement with the Purchaser reflecting the Purchasers amended
offer. If, after the expiry of the Matching Period, the Board of Directors
continues to believe, in good faith, after consultation with its financial
and outside legal advisors, that such Superior Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal and therefore rejects the Purchasers amended offer, if
any, or the Purchaser fails to enter into an agreement with the Company
reflecting such amended offer, the Company and the Board of Directors may,
subject to compliance with the other provisions hereof, effect a Change
in Recommendation (other than of the type referred to in clause (D) of the
definition thereof) and/or, subject to payment of the Termination Fee as set
forth in Section 8.1(1)(d)(i), terminate this Agreement to enter into an
agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal. 

  

(7) In the event that the Company provides the notice contemplated by Section
7.2(5)(b) on a date which is less than five business days prior to the
Company Meeting, the Purchaser shall be entitled to require the Company to
adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to a date that is not more than seven
business days after the date of such notice. 

  

(8) The Company acknowledges that each successive modification to any
Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes
of the requirement under Section 7.2(5)(b) and shall initiate a new five
business day period. 

  

(9) Nothing contained in this Agreement, including Section 7.2(1), shall
prohibit the Board of Directors from making a Change in Recommendation (other
than of the type identified in clause (D) of the definition thereof) or from
making any disclosure to any securityholders of the Company prior to the
Effective Time, including for greater certainty disclosure of a Change
in Recommendation, if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, failure to take such action or
make such disclosure would be a breach of the Board of Directors exercise of
its fiduciary duties or such action or disclosure is otherwise required under
applicable Law (including its obligations under Rules 14e-2 and 14d-9 under
the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal and by responding to an
Acquisition Proposal under a directors circular or otherwise as required
under Securities Laws), provided that for greater certainty in the event of a
Change of Recommendation and a termination by the Purchaser of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(1)(c)(i), the Company shall pay the 

  ##### 

  

   

Termination Fee as required by Section 7.3(2). The Board of Directors may not
make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to the preceding sentence unless the
Company gives the Purchaser at least two business days prior written notice
of its intention to make such Change in Recommendation;  _provided_ that, for
greater certainty, the foregoing limitation shall not apply in respect of
any actions taken under Section 7.2(6) after the expiry of the Matching
Period. In addition, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company or the Board of Directors from calling and holding a meeting of the
Shareholders, or any of them, requisitioned by the Shareholders, or any
of them, in accordance with the CBCA or ordered to be held by a court in
accordance with applicable Laws. 

   

     7.3  |   | Expenses and Termination Fees  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(1) The Purchaser shall pay all filing fees payable in connection with the
Regulatory Approvals. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party shall
pay all other fees, costs and expenses incurred by such Party in connection
with this Agreement and the Arrangement. 

  

(2) If a Termination Fee Event occurs, the Company shall pay as directed by
the Purchaser in writing (by wire transfer of immediately available funds)
the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3(3). For the purposes of
this Agreement, "Termination Fee" means Cdn$38,500,000, less the amount of
any non-resident withholding required by applicable Laws relating to Taxes
which is concurrently remitted by the Company to the relevant Governmental
Entity in respect of such amount, and "Termination Fee Event" means: 

   

       | (a)  |   | the termination of this Agreement pursuant to (i)
Section 8.1(1)(c)(i), or (ii) Section 8.1(1)(d)(i), or (iii) any subsection
of Section 8.1 if at such time the Purchaser is entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(1)(c)(i); or 
  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | except where a Termination Fee has been paid, (i) the
making or announcement or other public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal,
or an Acquisition Proposal otherwise becomes known to the Company or the
Board of Directors, after the announcement of the transactions contemplated
herein and prior to the termination of this Agreement, (ii) the exercise
by the Company or the Purchaser of their respective termination rights under
Section 8.1(1)(b)(i) or Section 8.1(1)(b)(iii) or by the Purchaser under
Section 8.1(1)(c)(ii), and (iii) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated
within a period of nine months from the exercise of such termination rights,
or a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal is entered
into by the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries within such nine-month
period; _provided_ , that for the purposes of this paragraph (b),
all references to "20%" or "10%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be changed to "50%".  
   

 

(3) If a Termination Fee Event occurs in circumstances described in Section
7.3(2)(a)(ii) or due to a termination of this Agreement by the Company in
circumstances described in Section 7.3(2)(a)(iii), the Termination Fee shall
be paid simultaneously with the occurrence of such Termination Fee Event. If
a Termination Fee Event occurs due to a termination of this Agreement by the
Purchaser in circumstances described in Section 7.3(2)(a)(i) or (iii), the
Termination Fee shall be paid within two business days following such
Termination Fee Event. If a Termination Fee Event occurs in the circumstances
described in Section 7.3(2)(b), the Termination Fee (less any amounts paid by
the Company to the Purchaser under Section 7.3(4)) shall be paid immediately
upon the earlier of entry by the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries into
a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
consummation of an Acquisition Proposal. 

  ##### 

  

   

(4) In the event that this Agreement is: 

   

       | (a)  |   | terminated pursuant to the exercise by the
Purchaser of its rights pursuant to Section 8.1(1)(c)(ii); or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | terminated pursuant to the exercise (A) by the Company
of its termination rights pursuant to Section 8.1(1)(d)(ii) or Section
8.1(1)(d)(iii), in each case if at the time of such termination there is no
state of facts or circumstances (other than a state of facts or circumstances
caused by a breach of this Agreement by the Purchaser) that would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 not to be satisfied on or
prior to the Outside Date, or (B) by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(1)(b)(i), if at such time the Company would otherwise have been entitled
to terminate this Agreement in the circumstances set forth in clause (A),
provided that in each case the Marketing Period shall have been completed,  
   

 

then, (i) in the case of clause (a), in addition to the rights of the
Purchaser under Section 7.3(2)(b) (including to any payment thereunder), the
Company shall pay to the Purchaser by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Purchaser an amount equal to the
Purchasers out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, up to a maximum amount of
Cdn$12,000,000 against receipts therefor and (ii) in the case of clause (b),
the Purchaser shall pay to the Company by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Company an amount equal
to Cdn$61,400,000 (the "Break-Up Fee"). In each case, such payment shall be
due within two business days of such termination. 

  

(5) In no event shall the Company be required to pay to the Purchaser in
connection with this Agreement, in the aggregate, an amount in excess of the
Termination Fee. 

  

(6) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and that, without those agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts
set out in this Section 7.3 are payments of liquidated damages which are
a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the Party entitled to such
damages will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such
payment and the resultant termination of this Agreement and are not
penalties. Each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to
raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or
punitive. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Companys right to receive payment of the Break-Up Fee from the Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 7.3 or the guaranty thereof pursuant to the Guaranty
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its subsidiaries
against the Purchaser, the Guarantor and any of their respective former,
current or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby
to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Purchaser,
the Guarantor or any of their respective former, current or future direct
or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers, general or
limited partners or assignees shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

   

     7.4  |   | Access to Information; Confidentiality Agreement  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(1) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, subject to compliance with applicable Law and
the terms of any Contract of the Company or its subsidiaries, the Company
shall: 

    ##### 

  

     

       | (a)  |   | give to the Purchaser and its representatives
(including its financing sources) reasonable access to the offices,
properties (including for the purpose of conducting environmental assessments
and investigations), books and records, including correspondence with
regulators and work papers, of the Company and its subsidiaries; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | furnish to the Purchaser and its representatives
(including its financing sources) such financial and operating data and other
information as such persons may reasonably request.  
   

 

(2) Any investigation pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall be conducted during
normal business hours and in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the conduct of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. Neither
the Purchaser nor any of its representatives shall contact officers or
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries except after prior
approval of Martin Lockyer, Vice President, Legal Services and Corporate
Secretary, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. 

  

(3) Notwithstanding Section 7.4(1) or any other provision of this Agreement,
the Company shall not be obligated to provide access to, or to disclose, any
information to the Purchaser if the Company reasonably determines that such
access or disclosure would violate applicable Law or jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege claim by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; _provided_
that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to put in place an
arrangement to permit such disclosure without loss of attorney-client
privilege. 

  

(4) For greater certainty, the Purchaser Parties shall treat, and shall cause
their respective representatives to treat, all information furnished to them
or any of such representatives (including the Lenders and any of their
representatives or advisors or any Purchaser Party) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement (including information furnished pursuant to Section 7.8) in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that
the Purchaser shall be entitled to provide such information to its Lenders
and investors in its debt financing and their respective representatives and
rating agencies, subject to the confidentiality conditions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Company Disclosure Letter and
all information contained in it is confidential and shall be treated in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. However, nothing
contained herein shall limit the ability of any person to disclose such
information as is required by Law to any Taxing Authority. 

   

     7.5  |   | Interim Period Consents  
---|---|--- 
   

 

The Purchaser shall, promptly following the date hereof, designate two
individuals from either of whom the Company may seek approval to undertake
any actions not otherwise permitted to be taken under Section 5.1, and shall
ensure that such persons shall respond, on behalf of the Purchaser, to the
Companys requests in an expeditious manner. 

   

     7.6  |   | Employee Matters  
---|---|--- 
   

 

From and after the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall honour and perform, or
cause the Company to honour and perform, all of the obligations of the
Company and any of its subsidiaries under any employment or collective
bargaining agreements with current or former Company Employees and
Company Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before
the Effective Time; _provided_  that no provision of this Section 7.6 shall
preclude the Company from terminating or amending any Company Plan in
accordance with its terms or as may be required by applicable Law nor give
any 

  ##### 

  

   

Company Employees any right to continued employment nor impair in any way the
right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate the employment
of any Company Employees. 

   

     7.7  |   | Indemnification and Insurance  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(1) From and after the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause
the Company to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law (and to also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law), each present and former director and
officer of any of the Company and its subsidiaries (each, an
"Indemnified Person") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any Proceedings arising out of or related to such
Indemnified Persons service as a director or officer of the Company and/or
any of its subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request
of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries at or prior to or following the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including the approval or completion of this Agreement and
the Arrangement or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or arising out of or related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Neither the Purchaser nor the Company shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
Proceeding involving or naming an Indemnified Person or arising out of or
related to an Indemnified Persons service as a director or officer of the
Company and/or any of its subsidiaries or services performed by such persons
at the request of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries at or prior to
or following the Effective Time without the prior written consent of that
Indemnified Person unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Person (which release shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person) from
all liability arising out of such Proceeding. 

  

(2) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its subsidiaries shall and,
if the Company and its subsidiaries are unable to, the Purchaser shall cause
the Company and its subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, to obtain and
fully pay a single premium for the extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys and its subsidiaries existing directors
and officers insurance policies for a claims reporting or run-off and
extended reporting period and claims reporting period of six years from and
after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of
time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carriers
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance ("DandO
Insurance"), and with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons than the
coverage provided under the existing policies of the Company and its
subsidiaries with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company
and its subsidiaries for any reason fail to obtain such "run off" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Company and its subsidiaries shall
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no
less advantageous than the coverage provided under the Companys and its
subsidiaries existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Company shall
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favourable to the Indemnified Persons as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Company be obligated pursuant to this Section 7.7(2) to obtain or
maintain any insurance policies if the annual premium for any such
policy exceeds 300% of the premium currently paid by the Company for any such
policy. 

    ##### 

  

    

(3) If any Indemnified Person makes any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Section 7.7 that is denied by the Company
or the Purchaser, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
Indemnified Person is entitled to such indemnification, then the Company and
the Purchaser shall pay such Indemnified Persons costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with
pursuing such claim against the Company or the Purchaser. 

  

(4) The rights of the Indemnified Persons under this Section 7.7 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the constating
or other charter or governance documents of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any Contract of
any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. All
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto in favour of any Indemnified Person
as provided in the constating documents of the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company or any Contract between such Indemnified Person and the Company
or any of its subsidiaries shall survive the Effective Time and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Person. 

  

(5) If the Company or, following the Effective Time, the Purchaser or any of
their successors or assigns shall (a) amalgamate, consolidate with or merge
or wind-up into any other person and, if applicable, shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity; or (b) transfer all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person or persons,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors, assigns and transferees of the Company or the Purchaser, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
7.7. 

  

(6) The provisions of this Section 7.7 shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are intended for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Persons, and their
respective heirs, executors, administrators and personal representatives and
shall be binding on the Company and its successors and assigns, and, for
such purpose only, the Company hereby confirms that it is acting as trustee
on their behalf. 

   

     7.8  |   | Financing Assistance  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(1) The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, and use its
reasonable best efforts to have its and their Representatives to, provide

Commitment Letter (provided that (i) to the extent reasonably practicable,
such request is made on reasonable notice and reasonably in advance of the
proposed commencement of the Marketing Period and/or the date that the Final

interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its subsidiaries or

or its subsidiaries of their obligations hereunder, and (iii) the Company
shall not be required to provide, or cause any subsidiaries to provide,

subsidiaries, which commitment is not conditional on the completion of the
Arrangement and does not terminate without liability to the Company or its
subsidiaries upon the termination of this Agreement), including as so

to solvency matters and consents of accountants for use of their reports in
any materials relating to such debt financing) and otherwise facilitating the
pledging of collateral as may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser

    | (j)  |   | using reasonable best efforts to take actions necessary

contemplated by this Agreement at the Effective Time, or (d) except as
required to comply with applicable Securities Laws disclose any information
that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure
of any trade secrets or similar information or violate any obligations of the
Company or any other person with respect to confidentiality. The Purchaser
agrees to indemnify the Company, its affiliates and their respective
officers, directors and employees from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any actions
or omissions by any of them in connection with any request by the Purchaser
made hereunder and for any alleged misstatement or omission in any
information provided hereunder at the request of the Purchaser (other
than historical factual information to the extent prepared by the Company and
relating to the Company and its subsidiaries). The Purchaser shall promptly
upon request by the Company and from time to time reimburse the Company and
its subsidiaries for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including legal
fees) incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries and their respective
advisers, agents and representatives in connection with any of actions
contemplated by this Section 7.8, including, if this Agreement is 

  ##### 

  

   

terminated by the Purchaser (other than pursuant to Section 8.1(1)(c)(i) or
8.1(1)(c)(ii)) in accordance with its terms, in connection with any unwinding
or similar transactions by the Company or its subsidiaries required as a
result of actions taken pursuant to this Section 7.8. 

   

     7.9  |   | Repayment of Existing Indebtedness  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(1) The Company shall repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit
Facility in full in accordance with the Senior Credit Facility, and shall
cause all security interests granted under the Senior Credit Facility and any
related agreements to be released in accordance with the Senior Credit
Facility and such agreements, in each case on the Effective Date, immediately
prior to the Effective Time. 

  

(2) As soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of any written request
by the Purchaser to do so, the Company shall make an offer to purchase and,
if requested by the Purchaser, consent solicitation with respect to all, but
not less than all, of the issued and outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes on
such terms and conditions as shall be specified, from time to time, by
the Purchaser in writing (including the related consent solicitation, if any,
the "Debt Tender Offer"), such offer to close immediately prior to the
Effective Time, conditional on all of the conditions to the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement set forth in Article VI
being satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement. The Company
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, and use its reasonable best
efforts to have its and their Representatives to, provide such cooperation to
the Purchaser as the Purchaser may reasonably request in connection with the
Debt Tender Offer. The dealer manager, solicitation agent, information agent,
depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Tender Offer
shall be selected by the Purchaser and the Company shall enter into customary
agreements with such parties so selected and on terms and conditions
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and the Company. The Company shall
not, without the consent of the Purchaser, waive any condition to the Debt
Tender Offer or make any changes to the Debt Tender Offer other than as
agreed between the Purchaser and the Company. The Company shall take all
steps reasonably necessary to complete the purchase of all
Senior Subordinated Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Debt Tender Offer
(and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiry of such offer) (the "Tendered
Notes") on the Effective Date, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including, if applicable, subject to the receipt of the requisite
consents, paying for consents validly delivered pursuant to the Debt Tender
Offer (and not validly withdrawn prior to the expiry of such offer). 

  

(3) If requested by the Purchaser in writing on a timely basis, in lieu of
commencing a Debt Tender Offer (or in addition thereto), the Company shall
(a) notify the Trustee (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture) in
accordance with Section 1103 of the Senior Notes Indenture of the
Companys intention to redeem any or all of the issued and outstanding Senior
Subordinated Notes on the Effective Date and take any other actions
reasonably requested by the Purchaser to redeem the Senior Subordinated Notes
on the Effective Date, immediately prior to the Effective Time and/or
(b) take any actions reasonably requested by the Purchaser that are
reasonably necessary to facilitate the satisfaction and/or discharge of any
or all of the Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the applicable section of
the Senior Notes Indenture, and shall redeem or satisfy and/or discharge,
as applicable, any or all of the Senior Subordinated Notes in accordance with
the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture on the Effective Date, immediately
prior to the Effective Time. 

  

(4) The Purchaser agrees to loan sufficient funds to the Company to enable the
Company to (a) repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility
in full, (b) purchase all Tendered Notes in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Debt Tender Offer and, if applicable, subject to receipt of
the requisite consents, pay for consents validly delivered and not revoked in
accordance with the Debt Tender Offer, and (c) pay all amounts required to
redeem, satisfy and/or discharge any Senior Subordinated Notes, in each case
as contemplated by this Section 7.9. Such funds (the "Purchaser Loan") shall
be advanced by the Purchaser to, or as directed by, the Company effective as
of immediately 

  ##### 

  

   

prior to the Effective Time and shall be evidenced by the issuance of a demand
promissory note, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Parties, by the Company to the Purchaser. 

  

(5) If this Agreement is terminated other than pursuant to Section
8.1(1)(c)(i), Section 8.1(1)(c)(ii) or Section 8.1(1)(d)(i), the Purchaser
shall promptly upon request by the Company reimburse the Company and its
subsidiaries for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including legal fees)
incurred by the Company or its subsidiaries and their respective advisors,
agents and representatives in connection with any actions contemplated by
this Section 7.9. 

   

     7.10  |   | Cooperation Regarding Reorganization  
---|---|--- 
   

 

(1) Subject to Section 7.10(3), the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to implement the Pre-Closing
Reorganization no later than one business day prior to the Effective Date
(unless otherwise agreed by the Purchaser) and shall cooperate with
the Purchaser in structuring, planning and implementing any reorganization
(including for Tax purposes) of their respective capital, assets and
corporate structure or such other planning as the Purchaser may request,
acting reasonably (an "Additional Reorganization"). 

  

(2) The Purchaser shall indemnify and save harmless the Companys and its
subsidiaries respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and
representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest awards, judgements and penalties suffered
or incurred by any of them in connection with or as a result of any
Reorganization. 

  

(3) The obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 7.10(1) are conditional
on the following: 

   

       | (a)  |   | any Reorganization shall not become effective
unless the Purchaser shall have waived or confirmed in writing the
satisfaction of all conditions in its favour in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2
and shall have confirmed in writing that it is prepared to promptly
without condition (other than the satisfaction of the condition contemplated
by Section 6.2(a)) proceed to effect the Arrangement;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the Purchaser shall fully indemnify the Company and its
subsidiaries for the implementation costs and any direct or indirect costs
and liabilities, including actual out-of-pocket costs, Taxes and loss of tax
attributes, that may be incurred as a result of, or to unwind, a
Reorganization if this Agreement is terminated other than pursuant to Section
8.1(1)(c)(i), Section 8.1(1)(c)(ii) or Section 8.1(1)(d)(i), which indemnity
shall survive termination of this Agreement; _provided_ that in no event
shall the Purchaser be required to pay to the Company any amounts under this
Section 7.10(3) in the event the Break-Up Fee is paid;  
      
    | (c)  |   | any Reorganization shall not materially delay, impair
or impede the completion of the Arrangement or the ability of the Purchaser
to obtain any financing required by it in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;  
      
    | (d)  |   | any Reorganization shall not unreasonably interfere in
material operations prior to the Effective Time of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries;  
      
    | (e)  |   | any Reorganization shall not require any filings with,
notifications to or approvals of any Governmental Entity or third party
(other than obtaining the Transportation Regulatory Approvals and such Tax
rulings, and filing such Tax elections or notifications and pre-filings or
pre-clearances with corporations branches or similar Governmental
Entities, in  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | each case as the Company shall agree, acting
reasonably, are necessary or advisable in the circumstances);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (f)  |   | any Reorganization shall not require the Company or any
subsidiary to contravene any applicable Laws, their respective organizational
documents or any Material Contract; and 
  
      
    | (g)  |   | the Company and its subsidiaries shall not be obligated
to take any action that could result in any Taxes being imposed on, or any
adverse Tax or other consequences to, any securityholder of the Company
incrementally greater than the Taxes or other consequences to such party in
connection with the consummation of the Arrangement in the absence of
any Reorganization.  
   

 

(4) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the planning for and
implementation of any Reorganization shall not be considered a breach of any
covenant under this Agreement and shall not be considered in determining
whether a representation or warranty of the Company hereunder has
been breached. The Purchaser and the Company shall work cooperatively and use
reasonable best efforts to prepare prior to the Effective Time all
documentation necessary and do such other acts and things as are necessary to
give effect to such Reorganization. For greater certainty, the Company
shall not be liable for the failure of the Purchaser to benefit from any
anticipated tax efficiency as a result of a Reorganization. 

   

     7.11  |   | Termination of Shareholders Agreement  
---|---|--- 
   

 

The Company shall, effective as of the Effective Date, terminate the
Shareholders Agreement and each other agreement between the Company and/or
any of its subsidiaries and any Shareholder relating to the Shares or to the
governance of the Company or its subsidiaries, in each case in accordance

     7.12  |   | Termination of Total Return Swap Agreement  
---|---|---

2, 2002 transaction confirmation, as amended on July 26, 2007. 

   

     7.13  |   | Designation of Preferred Shares  
---|---|--- 
   

 

Prior to the Effective Date, the Board of Directors shall designate a series

prior to the Outside Date, except that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(1)(b)(i) shall not be available to any Party whose
failure to fulfill any of its obligations has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such date;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | after the date hereof, there shall be enacted or made
any applicable Law (or any such applicable Law shall have been amended) that

non-appealable; or  
      
    | (iii)  |   | the Arrangement Resolution shall have failed to

the Arrangement or the Arrangement Resolution, or publicly proposes or
publicly states its intention to do so (it being understood that publicly
taking no position or a neutral position with respect to an Acquisition

formal announcement thereof shall not be considered a Change in
Recommendation), (B) the Board of Directors fails to publicly reconfirm such

---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | a breach of any representation or warranty or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in

forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 not to be satisfied, and such breach or
failure is incapable of being cured or is not cured within the earlier of (A)
30 days following the Purchasers delivery of notice of such breach and (B)
the Outside Date; _provided_ that the Purchaser is not then in breach of this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or

failure is incapable of being cured or is not cured within the earlier of (A)
30 days following the Companys delivery of notice of such breach and (B) the

Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or

(2) The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1 (other than pursuant to Section 8.1(1)(a)) shall give notice of such

liability for any breach of this Agreement, subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 7.3(5) and Section 7.3(6). 

  

(2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company

Company attempt to recover any amount from any former, current or future
direct or indirect equityholders, controlling persons, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners or assignees of any Purchaser Party (other than
the Guarantor in the case of the Purchaser to the extent set forth in the
Guaranty), and (e) no person (other than the Purchaser or its assignees)
shall have any rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, whether at Law or

liability of the Company (including the obligation to pay the Termination Fee
in accordance with Section 7.3) shall be limited to an amount equal to
the Termination Fee; (b) in no event shall the Purchaser or the Equity
Sponsor attempt to recover any amount (including the payment of the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3) that in the aggregate is in
excess of an amount equal to the Termination Fee; and (c) in no event shall
the Purchaser or the Equity Sponsor or any of their subsidiaries attempt to

     8.3  |   | Waiver  
---|---|--- 
   

 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar) or a
future waiver of the same provisions, nor shall such waiver be binding unless
executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. No failure
or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
applicable Laws.

Dissenting Shareholders in lieu of the Consideration.

amount by which (1) the Consideration multiplied by the number of Class A
Shares or Class B Shares, as applicable, issuable upon exercise of
the Rollover Option immediately before the Effective Time, exceeds (2) the

ARTICLE IV 
 RIGHTS OF DISSENT 

   

     4.1  |   | Rights of Dissent  
---|---|--- 
   

 

Registered holders of the Shares may exercise, pursuant to and in the manner
set forth in Section 190 of the CBCA, the right of dissent in connection with
the Arrangement, as same may be modified by the Interim Order and this
Section 4.1 ("Dissent Rights"); _provided_ that, notwithstanding subsection
190(5) of the CBCA, the written notice setting forth such registered holders
objection to the Arrangement Resolution referred to in subsection 190(5) of
the CBCA must be received by the Company not later than 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver
time) on the business day which is two business days immediately preceding
the date of the Company Meeting (as it may be adjourned or postponed
from time to time). Registered holders of the Shares who duly and validly
exercise such Dissent Rights and who: 

   

       | (1)  |   | are ultimately entitled to be paid by the
Purchaser the fair value for their Shares, (a) shall be deemed to have
transferred the Shares held by them and in respect of which Dissent Rights
have been duly and validly exercised to the Purchaser, without any
further act or formality, free and clear of all Liens at the time specified
in Section 3.1(10), in consideration of a debt claim against the Purchaser to
be paid the fair value of such Shares and (b) shall be entitled to be paid by
the Purchaser an amount equal to the fair value of such Shares, and shall not
be entitled to any other payment or consideration, including any payment that
would be payable under the Arrangement had such registered holders not
exercised their Dissent Rights in respect of such Shares; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid
fair value for their Shares, shall be deemed to have participated in the
Arrangement on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of Shares as
contemplated by Section 3.1(10).  
   

  

     4.2  |   | Recognition of Dissenting Shareholders  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | In no circumstances shall the Purchaser, the
Company or any other person be required to recognize a person exercising
Dissent Rights unless such person is the registered holder of those Shares in
respect of which such rights are sought to be exercised.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | For greater certainty, in no case shall the Purchaser,
the Company or any other person be required to recognize a Dissenting
Shareholder as a holder of Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights have
been validly exercised after the completion of Section 3.1(10), and the names
of such Dissenting Shareholders shall be removed from the registers of holders
of Class A Shares and/or Class B Shares, as applicable, in respect of which
Dissent Rights have been validly exercised at the same time as the event
described in Section 3.1(10) occurs and the Purchaser shall be recorded as
the holder of the Shares so transferred and shall be deemed the legal and
beneficial owner thereof free and clear of any Liens. In addition to any
other restrictions under section 190 of the CBCA, none of the following shall

holders of Rollover Options, (iii) holders of the SARs, (iv) holders of the
PSUs and (v) holders of Shares who vote or have instructed a proxyholder to
vote such Shares in favour of the Arrangement Resolution (but only in respect
of such Shares).

ARTICLE V 
 CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENTS 

   

     5.1  |   | Payment of Consideration  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (1)  |   | Prior to the Filing Time, in accordance with the
terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the Purchaser shall deposit, for the
benefit of holders of Shares, cash with the Depositary in the aggregate
amount equal to the payments in respect thereof required by this Plan
of Arrangement (with the amount per Share in respect of which Dissent Rights
have been exercised being deemed to be the Consideration per applicable Share
for this purpose only). The cash deposited with the Depositary shall be held
in an interest-bearing account, and any interest earned on such funds shall
be for the account of the Purchaser.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | Upon the surrender to the Depositary for cancellation
of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares that were transferred pursuant to Section 3.1(10),
together with a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and such
additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably
require, the holder of the Shares represented by such surrendered
certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor from the
Depositary, and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder as soon as
possible, a cheque (or other form of immediately available funds)
representing the cash which such holder has the right to receive under
the Arrangement for such Shares, less any amounts withheld pursuant to
Section 5.3, and any certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled.  
      
    | (3)  |   | Until surrendered for cancellation as contemplated by
this Section 5.1, each certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Shares shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender a cash payment in lieu of such
certificate as contemplated in this Section 5.1 or Section 4.1, as the case
may be, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.3. Any such
certificate formerly representing Shares not duly surrendered on or before the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim by
or interest of any former holder of Shares of any kind or nature against or
in the Company or the Purchaser. On such date, all cash to which such former
holder was entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered to the
Purchaser.  
      
    | (4)  |   | Prior to the Filing Time, in accordance with the
Arrangement Agreement, the Purchaser shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, for the benefit of holders of Options, PSUs and SARs, the
Subscription Amount (which is an aggregate cash amount equal the payments
in respect thereof required by the Company under this Plan of Arrangement)
with the Depositary. The cash shall be held in a separate interest-bearing
account and any interest earned on such funds prior to the Effective Time
shall be for the account of the Purchaser and thereafter for the account of
the Company. On or as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, the
Depositary shall deliver, on behalf of the Company, to each person
who immediately before the Effective Time was a holder of Options, PSUs and
SARs, as reflected on the register or accounts maintained by or on behalf of
the Company in respect of Options, PSUs and SARs as provided to the
Depositary, a cheque (or other form of immediately available funds)
representing the cash payment, if any, which such holder of Options, PSUs and
SARs is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(7), Section 3.1(8) and
Section 3.1(9), respectively, less any amounts required to be withheld
pursuant to Section 5.3.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | (5)  |   | Any payment made by way of cheque by the
Depositary on behalf of the Company or the Purchaser pursuant to this Plan of
Arrangement that has not been deposited or has been returned to the
Depositary or that otherwise remains unclaimed, in each case, on or
before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, and any right or claim to
payment hereunder that remains outstanding on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or
nature and the right of the holder to receive the consideration for the
Shares, Options, PSUs or the SARs, as the case may be, pursuant to this Plan
of Arrangement shall terminate and be deemed to be surrendered and forfeited
to the Purchaser for no consideration.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (6)  |   | No holder of Shares, Options, PSUs or SARs shall be
entitled to receive any consideration with respect to such securities other
than any cash payment to which such holder is entitled to receive in
accordance with Article III and this Section 5.1 and, for greater certainty,
no such holder will be entitled to receive any interest, dividends, premium
or other payment in connection therewith, other than any declared but
unpaid dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Date. No dividend
or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time with respect
to the Class A Shares and/or the Class B Shares with a record date on or
after the Effective Date shall be delivered to the holder of any
unsurrendered certificate which, immediately prior to the Effective
Date, represented outstanding Shares.  
   

  

     5.2  |   | Lost Certificates  
---|---|--- 
   

 

In the event that any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented one or more outstanding Shares that were transferred
pursuant to Section 3.1(10) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, cash deliverable
in accordance with such holders Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing such
payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the person
to whom such cash is to be delivered shall, as a condition precedent to
the delivery of such cash, give a bond satisfactory to the Purchaser and the
Depositary (acting reasonably) in such sum as the Purchaser may direct, or
otherwise indemnify the Purchaser and the Company in a manner satisfactory to
the Purchaser and the Company, acting reasonably, against any claim that may
be made against the Purchaser and the Company with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

     5.3  |   | Withholding Rights

       | (i)  |   | _General_  Subject to the Act, Amalco may redeem
the whole or any part of the issued Preferred Shares on payment for each
share to be redeemed of the redemption price plus any dividends declared but
unpaid thereon.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | _Notice_  Unless all the holders of the Preferred
Shares to be redeemed shall have waived notice of such redemption, Amalco
shall give not less than 5 days notice in writing of such redemption by
mailing to each person who at the date of mailing is a registered holder of
the Preferred Shares to be redeemed a notice in writing of the intention of
Amalco to redeem such Preferred Shares. Such notice shall be mailed in a
prepaid envelope addressed to each such shareholder at such shareholders
address as it appears on the books of Amalco or, in the event of the address
of any such shareholder not so appearing, then to the last known address of
such shareholder, provided however, that accidental failure or omission to
give any such notice to one or more of such holders shall not affect the
validity of such redemption. Such notice shall set out the redemption price
of the shares to be redeemed and the date on which redemption is to
take place and, if part only of the Preferred Shares held by the person to
whom notice is given is to be redeemed, the number thereof so to be
redeemed.

its sole discretion shall determine or, if the board of directors so
determines, shall be redeemed pro rata, disregarding fractions, and the board
of directors may provide for such adjustments as may be necessary to avoid
the redemption of fractions of shares. If a part only of the Preferred Shares
represented by any certificates are redeemed, a new certificate for the
balance shall be issued by Amalco.  
      
    | (v)  |   | _Cessation of Rights_  From and after the date
specified for redemption in any such notice, the Preferred Shares called for

respect of which such deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed and the
holders thereof after such deposit or such redemption date, as the case may
be, shall be limited to receiving without interest their proportionate part
of the total amount so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the
said certificates held by them respectively, and interest allowed on any such
deposit shall belong to Amalco.

       | (i)  |   | _General_  Subject to the Act, a holder of any
Preferred Shares shall be entitled to require Amalco to redeem the whole or

shares by paying to such registered holder an amount equal to the redemption
price plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon. Such payment shall be

the time being. If a part only of the Preferred Shares represented by any
certificates are redeemed, a new certificate for the balance shall be issued
by Amalco.  
      
    | (iv)  |   | _Cessation of Rights_  The Preferred Shares shall be
redeemed on the redemption date and thereafter such shares shall cease to be
entitled to dividends and the holders thereof shall not be entitled to
exercise any of the rights of shareholders in respect thereof, unless payment
of the redemption price plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon is not
made on the redemption date, in which case the rights of the holders of such
shares shall remain unaffected.

the Laws of Canada and has all corporate power and authority to own its
assets as now owned and to carry on its business as now conducted.
The Company is duly registered or otherwise authorized to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of its
properties, whether owned, leased, licensed or otherwise held, or the nature
of its activities makes such registration necessary, and has all governmental
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents
and approvals the absence of which do not have or would not be reasonably
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (b)  |   | Corporate Authorization _._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and have been, or shall be at the Effective Time,

of the Company Circular and the approval by the Shareholders in the manner
required by the Interim Order and applicable Laws and approval by the Court.
This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the
qualification that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other Laws of general application relating to
or affecting rights of creditors and that equitable remedies, including
specific performance, are discretionary and may not be ordered. As of the
date hereof, the Board of Directors has (i)determined that the Consideration
per Class A Share and per Class B Share to be received by the holders of such

best interests of the Company and (ii) resolved, subject to Section 7.2(9),
to unanimously recommend (subject to abstentions) that the Shareholders vote

resolutions are effective and unamended as of the date hereof.  
      
  (c)  |   | Governmental Authorization _._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the

under the CBCA; (iv) the Regulatory Approvals; (v) compliance with any

the Company of its obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Plan of Arrangement do not
and shall not (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of any provision of the articles of amalgamation or by-laws of the
Company or the constating documents of any of its subsidiaries, (ii) assuming
compliance with the matters, or obtaining the approvals, referred to in
paragraph (c) above, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or
breach of any provision of any applicable Law or any license, approval,
consent or authorization issued by a Governmental Entity held by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) require any notice or consent or other
action by any person under, contravene, conflict with, violate, breach or
constitute a default or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of
time or  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or
permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any
right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries is entitled under, or give rise to any rights of first
refusal or trigger any change in control provisions or any restriction under,
any provision of any Contract or other instrument binding upon the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or affecting any of their respective assets or (iv)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, with such exceptions, in the case of each of
clauses (ii) through (iv), as do not have or would not have, or not be
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the articles of
amalgamation and by-laws of the Company as currently in effect have been made
available to the Purchaser and the Company has not taken any action to amend
or succeed such documents.

Company consists of an unlimited number of Class A Shares, an unlimited
number of Class B Shares, an unlimited number of Ordinary Shares, an
unlimited number of first preferred shares, issuable in series, and an
unlimited number of second preferred shares, issuable in series. As of

    | (v)  |   | To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred
regarding any Company Plan that would entitle any person (without the consent
