suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provisions of, or based on any matter arising out
of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in
any court of the Province of British Columbia, and each of the Parties irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without
the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service
of process on such Party as provided in Section&nbsp;9.1 shall be deemed effective service.

Process Agent, the Party effecting such service shall also deliver a copy thereof to the Purchaser
in the manner provided in Section&nbsp;9.1. The Purchaser shall take all such action as may be necessary
to continue said appointment in full force and effect or to appoint another agent so that the
Purchaser shall at all times have an agent for service of process for the above purposes in the
Province of British Columbia. In the event of the transfer of all or substantially all of the

assets or otherwise, such other entity shall be substituted hereunder for the Process Agent with
the same effect as if named herein in place of Blake, Cassels &#038; Graydon LLP. Nothing herein shall
