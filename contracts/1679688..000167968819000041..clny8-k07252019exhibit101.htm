hereinafter referred to as "the Company," and where the context permits,
references to "the Company" shall include the Company and any successor to the
Company.

WHEREAS, the Executive has on the date hereof entered into a Contribution and
Purchase Agreement with Colony Capital Acquisitions, LLC, a subsidiary of the
Company (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which his and his co-owners
interests in Digital Bridge Holdings, LLC ("DBH") are being transferred to the
Company such that DBH will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company; and

WHEREAS, CLNY desires to enter into this Agreement with the Executive,
effective as of the closing of the Purchase Agreement (the "Effective Date"),
setting forth the terms by which the Executive will be employed by Colony
Capital Operating Company, LLC or one of its subsidiaries (as applicable, the
"Operating Entity") and will serve as a Managing Director of CLNY and Chief
Executive Officer of the Operating Entity's digital realty platform (the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the mutual
covenants, terms and conditions set forth herein, and other valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

EMPLOYMENT TERM. The Executive's employment under the terms and conditions of
this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall expire on the
fifth anniversary of the Effective Date (the "Initial Term"); provided, that,
the term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for additional
successive one-year periods (each a "Renewal Term") unless, not later than 180
days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal
Term, as applicable, either party provides written notice to the other party
hereto that such extension shall not take effect (a "Non-Renewal Notice"). The
period during which the Executive is employed by the Company during the
Initial Term and any Renewal Term pursuant to this Agreement is referred to
herein as the "Employment Term". Notwithstanding anything set forth in this
Section 1 to the contrary, the Employment Term and the Executive's employment
shall earlier terminate immediately upon the termination of the Executive's
employment pursuant to Section 4 hereof.

POSITION; REPORTING AND DUTIES; LOCATION. 

(a) Position and Reporting. During the Initial Term, the Executive shall serve
as a Managing Director of CLNY and the Digital Realty CEO. The Executive shall
report solely and directly to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the
"CLNY CEO"); provided, that, beginning on the later of (i) the date upon which
the investment period for Digital Colony Partners terminates and (ii) December
31, 2020, the Executive shall instead serve as the CLNY CEO and report solely
and directly to the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") and the
Executive Chairman of the Company, if any.



(b) Duties and Responsibilities.

(i) During the Employment Term, the Executive shall devote his full business
time (excepting vacation time, holidays, sick days and periods of disability)
and attention to the performance of his duties hereunder, shall faithfully
serve the Company and shall have no other employment which is undisclosed to
the Company or which conflicts with his duties under this Agreement; provided,
that, nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Executive from (A)
participating in trade associations or industry organizations, (B) engaging in
charitable, civic, educational or political activities, (C) delivering
lectures or fulfilling speaking engagements, (D) engaging in personal
investment activities and personal real estate-related activities for himself
and his family or (E) accepting directorships or similar positions (together,
the "Personal Activities"), in each case so long as the Personal Activities do
not unreasonably interfere, individually or in the aggregate, with the
performance of the Executive's duties to the Company under this Agreement. The
Company hereby acknowledges and approves the current activities of the
Executive as set forth on Schedule 1 hereto, each of which shall be deemed a
Personal Activity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the
Personal Activities include the Executive providing services to any for-profit
company (excluding CLNY, the DBH Legacy Investments (as defined below), and
any subsidiaries or portfolio companies thereof) as a member of such company's
board of directors, only two such directorships shall be permitted as a
Personal Activity.

(ii) In serving in his capacity as a Managing Director of CLNY and the Digital
Realty CEO, during the Employment Term, and as CLNY CEO during each Renewal
Term, the Executive (A) shall have such duties and responsibilities
commensurate with such position, (B) may continue to provide services to
legacy investments managed by DBH (including Digital Colony Partners) (the
"DBH Legacy Investments") and to comply with the Executive's time and
attention commitments to such DBH Legacy Investments and (C) shall provide
such other duties as are consistent with his role as Managing Director of CLNY
and the Digital Realty CEO, or CLNY CEO, as reasonably requested from time to
time by the Board or, during the Initial Term, the CLNY CEO.

(iii) The parties acknowledge and agree that all of the compensation and
benefits provided to the Executive hereunder will be in respect of services
performed by the Executive for the Operating Entity.

(c) Location of Employment. The Executive's principal place of business during
the Employment Term shall be at the DBH office in Boca Raton, Florida;
provided, that, the Executive may perform his duties in such other locations
in his reasonable discretion so long as he performs such duties in a manner
consistent with his position and responsibilities and takes into consideration
the needs of the Company; provided, further,that, the Executive may be
required to engage in travel during the Employment Term in the performance of
his duties hereunder, including at the Board's reasonable request. In the
event such travel results in Executive having to perform a significant portion
of his duties at a Company location other than his principal place of business
for a significant period of time, and Executive determines to relocate his
principal place of residence to a city in proximity to such other Company
location, on a permanent or temporary basis, the Company shall pay for all
relocation and return expenses on a tax-grossed up basis, with



such payments subject to approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, by the
Board or a committee of directors delegated by the Board.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS. 

(a) Base Salary. During the Employment Term, the Company will pay to the
Executive a base salary at the annualized rate of not less than $1,060,000
(the base salary in effect from time to time, the "Base Salary"). The Base
Salary will be paid to the Executive in accordance with the Company's
customary compensation practices from time to time in effect for the Company's
senior executive officers. The CLNY CEO or the Board will review the Base
Salary from time to time, but at least annually, during the Employment Term,
but may not reduce the Executive's then-existing Base Salary without the
Executive's prior written consent and agreement.

(b) Annual Cash Bonus

(i) For each calendar year during the Employment Term beginning with the
calendar year 2020, the Executive shall be given an opportunity to earn an
annual incentive cash bonus based upon the achievement of performance measures
as set forth on Schedule 2 or as otherwise mutually agreed by the Executive
and the CLNY CEO or the Board (as applicable, the "Annual Bonus"). The
Executive's target Annual Bonus for the 2020 calendar year shall be $1,200,000
(such amount, as increased from time to time, the "Target Bonus Amount"). The
actual Annual Bonus amount paid to the Executive in respect of any calendar
year during the Employment Term may be less or more than the applicable Target
Bonus Amount. For each calendar year after 2020, the Board (or a committee of
directors delegated by the Board) will review the Target Bonus Amount from
time to time, but at least annually, but may not reduce the Executive's then
existing Target Bonus Amount without the Executive's prior written consent and
agreement. For 2019, the Executive's cash bonus shall be at an annual rate of
$600,000, which shall be pro-rated from the Effective Date through December
31, 2019.

(ii) Any Annual Bonus payment that becomes payable to the Executive hereunder
will be paid to him in a cash lump sum by no later than March 15 of the
calendar year following the calendar year to which it relates (and no later
than the date on which bonuses are paid to other senior executive officers of
CLNY); provided, that, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, the
Executive is an active employee as of, and has not given or received notice of
termination of employment as of, the date such payment would otherwise be
made.

(c)

Equity Incentives and Related Awards. 

(i) For each calendar year during the Employment Term beginning with the
calendar year 2020, the Executive shall be eligible to receive equity and
equity-based incentive awards based upon the achievement of performance
measures as set forth on Schedule 2 or as otherwise mutually agreed by the
Executive and the CLNY CEO or the Board ("LTIP Awards"), with an annual target
LTIP Award opportunity for the 2020 calendar shall be $1,800,000 (the target
amount in effect from time to time, the "Target LTIP Award"). For each
calendar year after 2020, the Target LTIP Award and any applicable performance
measures will be determined by the Board (or a committee of directors
delegated by the



Board) in consultation with the Executive. The Board (or a committee of
directors delegated by the Board) will review the Target LTIP Award from time
to time, but at least annually, during the Employment Term, but may not reduce
the Executive's then existing Target LTIP Award without the Executive's prior
written consent and agreement. The LTIP Award shall vest (A) at least 50%
based solely on time-based vesting conditions in no more than three equal
annual instalments and (B) up to 50% subject to a combination of time-based
and performance-based vesting conditions over a vesting period no longer than
three years. The LTIP Awards that vest based, in part, on performance-based
vesting conditions shall be structured to provide an additional opportunity
equal to twice the Target LTIP Award applicable to the performance-based
awards in the event that the Company exceeds the performance measures
established by the Board (or committee thereof). For 2019, the Executive's
LTIP Awards shall be at an annual rate of $900,000, which shall be pro-rated
from the Effective Date through December 31, 2019. LTIP Awards may be in the
equity of the Company or the equity of other companies managed by the Company.

(ii) The Executive shall be granted allocations in respect of carried
interests, incentive fees and other such remuneration in respect of funds and
similar vehicles, as applicable, managed by the Company (collectively, "Fund
Incentives") as set forth herein. For any Fund Incentives allocated during the
Employment Term in respect of a successor fund to Digital Colony Partners or
other fund related to digital infrastructure (the "DCP Funds"), the Executive
will be allocated a sharing percentage equal to 15% of such Fund Incentives.
For any Fund Incentives allocated during the Employment Term after the
Executive becomes the CLNY CEO in respect of a New Product (as defined below),
the Executive will be allocated a sharing percentage equal to 10% of such Fund
Incentives. New Products means any fund or similar vehicle, excluding DCP
Funds, managed by the Company, excluding (x) CDCF V and (y) any product that
has completed raising capital prior to the Executive becoming the CLNY CEO.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a product that has previously raised capital
shall not be deemed to be a New Product as a result of raising additional
capital for follow-on investments after the Executive becomes the CLNY CEO.
The terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting and co-investment)
of any LTIP Awards and Fund Incentives shall be no less favorable than the
terms and conditions of any LTIP Awards and Fund Incentives, as applicable,
granted to the executive officers of the Company during the same calendar
year.

(iii) On the Effective Date, the Company shall make an equity award grant to
the Executive (the "Sign-on Equity Award") in the amounts set forth on, and
consistent with the terms and conditions of, the Sign-on Equity Award Term
Sheet, attached hereto as Exhibit C.

(d) Retirement, Welfare and Fringe Benefits. During the Employment Term, the
Executive shall be eligible to participate in the retirement savings, medical,
disability, life insurance, perquisite and other welfare and fringe benefit
plans applicable to senior executive officers of CLNY (which will include
emergency airlift (if needed) from locations outside the United States to the
United States) generally in accordance with the terms of such plans as are in
effect from time to time. The foregoing shall not be construed to limit the
ability of the Company to amend, modify or terminate any such benefit plans,
policies or programs in accordance with their terms or to cease providing such
benefit plans, policies or programs at any time and from time to time;
provided, that, subject to the last sentence of this Section



3(d), the terms and conditions imposed on Executive's participation in such
plans, policies or programs and any adverse amendments, terminations and
modifications are at least as favorable to Executive as those applicable to
other senior executives. In addition, the Executive shall receive
reimbursement for YPO membership dues (the "Other Fringe Benefits").

(e) Paid Time Off. During the Employment Term, the Executive shall be eligible
to participate in the paid time off policies generally applicable to CLNY's
senior executives as are in effect from time to time.

(f) Business Expenses. The Company shall pay or reimburse the Executive for
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that the Executive incurs in connection
with his employment during the Employment Term upon presentation of expense
statements or vouchers and such other information as the Company may require
in accordance with the generally applicable policies and procedures of the
Company applicable to CLNY's senior executive officers as are in effect from
time to time. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent the Executive
travels on a chartered or private jet (including any aircraft which the
Executive may partially or fully own) for Company business, the Company will
reimburse the Executive for the variable operational cost of such flight;
provided that if any passengers on such flight are not traveling on Company
business, an allocation of the variable operational cost of such flight shall
be made equally to each passenger, and reimbursement shall be in the amount of
the allocation for those persons traveling on such flight for Company
business. Variable operational costs shall be limited to the following: fuel;
landing, parking and handling fees; crew expenses (excluding compensation and
benefits); and supplies and catering. No other costs or expenses relating to
chartered or private jet travel will be reimbursable. No expense payment or
reimbursement under this Section 3(f) shall be "grossed up" or increased to
take into account any tax liability incurred by the Executive as a result of
such payment or reimbursement.

(g) Insurance; Indemnification. The Executive shall be covered by such
comprehensive directors' and officers' liability insurance and errors and
omissions liability insurance as the Company shall have established and
maintained in respect of its directors and officers generally at its expense,
and the Company shall cause such insurance policies to be maintained in a
manner reasonably acceptable to the Executive both during and, in accordance
with the provisions of Section 4(a)(i)(D) below, after Executive's employment
with the Company. The Executive shall also be entitled to indemnification
rights, benefits and related expense advances and reimbursements to the same
extent as any other director or officer of CFI and to the maximum extent
permitted under applicable law pursuant to an indemnification agreement at
least as favorable to the Executive as any indemnification agreement between
the CLNY CEO and the Company as of the Effective Date.

(h) Minimum Compensation. For the performance years 2019 (on a pro rata
basis), 2020 and 2021 only, the Executive's minimum annual gross compensation
as provided in Sections 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) will be $2,500,000.

(i) Attorneys' Fees. The Company shall promptly pay or reimburse the Executive
for reasonable attorneys' fees of one law firm incurred by (i) the Executive
in connection with the review, negotiation, drafting and execution of this
Agreement,the Restrictive Covenants Agreement and any related arrangements,
and (ii) Ben Jenkins in connection



with his employment agreement, and any agreements related thereto, in an
aggregate amount not to exceed $100,000, subject to the Executive providing
the Company with reasonable documentation of such fees within 30 days
following the Effective Date. The Company shall reimburse the Executive for
such fees within 10 business days following Executive's submission to the
Company of the documentation evidencing the fees.

the Executive (including any taxes for which the Executive or the Company may
incur solely as a result of the Company providing such access)); and (D) any
additional amounts or benefits due under any applicable plan, program,
agreement or arrangement of the Company (including continuing "tail"
indemnification and directors and officers liability insurance for actions and
inactions occurring while the Executive provided services for CLNY and its
affiliates and continued coverage for any actions or inactions by the
Executive while providing cooperation under this Agreement), including any
such plan, program, agreement or arrangement relating to equity or equity-
based awards (the amounts and benefits described in clauses (A) through (D)
above, collectively, the "Accrued Benefits"). The Accrued Benefits shall in
all events be paid in accordance with the Company's payroll procedures,
expense reimbursement procedures or plan terms, as applicable.

shall remain employed by the Company and shall continue to be bound by all the
terms of this Agreement and any other applicable duties and obligations to the
Company, (B) the Company may direct the Executive not to report to work, and
(C) the Executive shall only undertake such actions on behalf of the Company,
consistent with his position, as expressly directed by the Company.

(b) Termination for Cause or by the Executive without Good Reason.

(i) The Employment Term and the Executive's employment hereunder may be
terminated at any time either (A) by the Company for "Cause" (as defined and
determined below), effective as set forth in Section 4(b)(iii), or (B) by the
Executive without Good Reason, effective 30 days following the date on which
notice of such termination is given by the Executive to the Company.

(ii) If the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or
by the Executive without Good Reason, the Executive shall only be entitled to
receive the Accrued Benefits.



(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, a termination for "Cause" shall mean a
termination of the Executive's employment with the Company because of (A) the
Executive's conviction of, or plea of no contest to, any felony under the laws
of the United States or any state within the United States (other than a
traffic-related felony) which termination shall become effective immediately
as of the date the CLNY CEO or the Board determines to terminate the
Agreement, which action must be taken on or after the date of such conviction
or plea or within 60 days thereafter; (B) the Executive's willful and gross
misconduct in connection with the performance of his duties to the Company
(other than by reason of his incapacity or disability), it being expressly
understood that the Company's dissatisfaction with the Executive's performance
shall not constitute Cause; or (C) a continuous, willful and material breach
by the Executive of this Agreement after written notice of such breach has
been provided to the Executive by the CLNY CEO or the Board, provided, that,
in no event shall any action or omission in subsections (B) or (C) constitute
"Cause" unless (1) the Company gives notice to the Executive stating that the
Executive will be terminated for Cause, specifying the particulars thereof in
reasonable detail and the effective date of such termination (which shall be
no less than 10 business days following the date on which such written notice
is received by the Executive) (the "Cause Termination Notice"), (2) the
Company provides the Executive and his counsel with an opportunity to appear
before the CLNY CEO or the Board to rebut or dispute the alleged reason for
termination on a specified date that is at least three business days following
the date on which the Cause Termination Notice is given, but prior to the
stated termination date described in clause (1), (3) the CLNY CEO, or after
such time that the Executive serves as CLNY CEO, a majority of the Board
(calculated without regard to the Executive), has determined that the
Executive has failed to materially cure or cease such misconduct or breach
within 10 business days after the Cause Termination Notice was given to him
and (4) in the case of subsections (B) and (C) above, the Company has
suffered, or is reasonably expect to suffer, material economic or reputational
harm. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, no act, or failure to act, on
the Executive's part shall be considered willful unless done or omitted to be
done, by him not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action
or omission was in the best interest of the Company, and any act or omission
by the Executive as directed by the CLNY CEO or the Board or on the advice of
counsel for the Company will be deemed made in good faith and in the best
interests of the Company.

(c) Termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good
Reason.

(i) The Employment Term and the Executive's employment hereunder may be
terminated (A) by the Company at any time without Cause, effective four
business days following the date on which written notice to such effect is
delivered to the Executive, or (B) by the Executive for "Good Reason" (as
defined and determined below), effective as set forth in Section 4(c)(iii). If
the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by
the Executive for Good Reason, the Company shall pay or provide to the
Executive (A) the Accrued Benefits and (B) upon the Executive's execution of a
separation agreement containing a general release of claims substantially in
the form attached as Exhibit A hereto (the "Release"), and the expiration of
the applicable revocation period with respect to such Release within 60 days
following the date of termination (the date on which the Release becomes
effective, the "Release Effective Date"):



(A)A lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) three and (ii) the sum
of (1) the Base Salary in effect immediately prior to the date of termination
(without regard to any reduction that gives rise to Good Reason) and (2) (x)
if such termination occurs on or after the date on which the Annual Bonus, if
any, is paid to the Executive in respect of the third calendar year following
the calendar year in which the Effective Date occurs (the "Third Annual
Bonus"), the average Annual Bonus paid in respect of each of the three
calendar years prior to the date of termination or (y) if such termination
occurs prior to the date on which the Third Annual Bonus, if any, is paid, the
Target Bonus Amount in effect immediately prior to the date of termination
(without regard to any reduction that gives rise to Good Reason), payable on
the first regularly scheduled payroll date of the Company following the
Release Effective Date and in no event later than the 60th day following the
date of termination (the actual date of payment, the "Severance Payment
Date"); provided, that, if the 60-day period referenced in this Section
4(c)(i)(A) begins in one calendar year and ends in a subsequent calendar year,
the Severance Payment Date will in all events occur in the second calendar
year;

(B)A lump sum cash payment equal to the Annual Bonus, if any, that the
Executive would have received in respect of the calendar year prior to the
calendar year in which the termination occurs had the Executive remained an
active employee of the Company, based on the achievement of the applicable
performance measures, to the extent unpaid as of the termination date, payable
on the date such amount would have been paid had the Executive continued in
employment (the "Unpaid Bonus");

(C)A lump-sum payment equal to the product of (1) the Target Annual Bonus in
effect for the calendar year in which the termination occurs, and (2) a
fraction, the numerator of which shall equal the number of days during the
year in which the termination date occurs that the Executive was employed by
the Company and the denominator of which shall equal 365, payable on the
Severance Payment Date (the "Pro-Rated Bonus");

(D)The Executive and the Executive's eligible dependents shall continue to be
covered at the expense of the Company by the same or substantially equivalent
coverage for the 24 calendar months immediately following the end of the
calendar month in which the termination date occurs under the medical, dental
and vision programs in which the Executive and the Executive's eligible
dependents participated immediately prior to his termination of employment
(the "Group Health Benefits"). Except as may be otherwise agreed by the
Executive, all such Group Health Benefits coverages shall be provided under
insured plans or arrangements. If the Company determines in good faith that
such continuation of Group Health Benefits coverage would cause adverse tax
consequences to the Company or the Executive under applicable law, the Company
shall instead provide the Executive with monthly cash payments during such
24-month period in an amount that, after reduction for applicable taxes
(assuming the Executive pays taxes at the highest marginal rates in the
applicable jurisdictions), is equal to the cost of providing the continuing
Group Health Benefits coverage. The applicable period of health benefit
continuation under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985
("COBRA") shall begin on the expiration of such 24-month period; and



(E)Except as otherwise provided in the documents governing the Sign-on Equity
Award, full vesting as of the date of termination of any and all equity or
equity-based awards relating to the securities of the Company and any Fund
Incentives that are outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the date of
such termination.

(F)Continued provision of the Other Fringe Benefits (including, without
limitation, security and kidnap insurance as in effect immediately prior to
the date of such termination) for 24 calendar months immediately following the
date of such termination. In addition during the 18 calendar months
immediately following the date of termination, the Company shall provide
Executive continued use of his office and the services of a personal
assistant, in each case, commensurate with those provided prior to the date of
termination.

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean any action by
the Company, in each case without the Executive's prior written consent, that
(A) results in a material diminution in the Executive's duties, authority or
responsibilities or a diminution in the Executive's title or position;
provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) modifying the Executive's
title (other than as set forth in Section 2 hereof) and (y) after the
Executive becomes CLNY CEO, the failure to nominate or maintain the Executive
on the Board shall each constitute Good Reason; (B) requires the Executive to
report to any person other than the CLNY CEO, or, after the Executive becomes
CLNY CEO, the Board; (C) reduces the Base Salary, Target Annual Bonus or
Target LTIP Award as set forth herein; (D) relocates the Executive's principal
place of employment to a location more than 25 miles from the DBH office in
Boca Raton, Florida; provided, that if the Executive agrees in writing to
establish another location as his principal place of employment, then for
purposes of this clause (D) such other location shall be substituted for Boca
Raton, Florida; (E) constitutes a material breach by the Company of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, failure to timely pay or award the
Base Salary, Target Annual Bonus or Target LTIP Award) or any other material
agreement between the Executive and the Company (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Restrictive Covenant Agreement), which such material breach
shall include, without limitation, any action by the Company that restricts
the Executive's ability to comply with his then-applicable time and attention
obligations to the DBH Legacy Investments; (F) results in the Executive not
having the title of CLNY CEO after the later of (x) Thomas J. Barrack, Jr.
ceasing to be CLNY CEO, (y) the investment period for Digital Colony Partners
terminates and (z) December 31, 2020; provided; however, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Executive shall have Good Reason if Executive is not
CEO at any time when all of the foregoing conditions (x), (y) and (z) have
been satisfied; provided, further, that, in no event shall the occurrence of
any such condition constitute Good Reason unless (1) the Executive gives
notice to the Company of the existence of the Executive's knowledge of the
condition giving rise to Good Reason within 90 days following its initial
existence, (2) the Company fails to cure such condition within 30 days
following the date such notice is given and (3) the Executive terminates his
employment with the Company within 30 days following the expiration of such
cure period.

Executive and the Company. All fees and expenses of any such physician shall
be borne solely by the Company.

retain his mobile phone(s) and personal computer(s) and his cell phone
number(s).

(g) Resignation as Officer or Director. Unless requested otherwise by the
Company, upon any termination of the Executive's employment hereunder the
Executive



shall resign each position (if any) that the Executive then holds as an
officer or director of the Company or any other entity where he is an officer
or director at the request or direction of the Company. The Executive's
execution of this Agreement shall be deemed the grant by the Executive to the
officers of the Company of a limited power of attorney to sign in the
Executive's name and on the Executive's behalf any such documentation as may
be required to be executed solely for the limited purposes of effectuating
such resignations.

(h) No Set-Off or Mitigation. The Company's obligations to make payments under
this Agreement shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment
or other claim the Company or any of its affiliates may have against the
Executive. The Executive does not need to seek other employment or take any
other action to mitigate any amounts owed to the Executive under this
Agreement, and those amounts shall not be reduced if the Executive does obtain
other employment.

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. The Executive is entering into the Restrictive Covenant
Agreement, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto (the
"Restrictive Covenant Agreement"), as of the date hereof. The Restrictive
Covenant Agreement shall become effective as of the Effective Date and shall
continue in effect at all applicable times following the Effective Date in
accordance with the terms and conditions thereof.

SECTION 280G. 

(a) Treatment of Payments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any
other plan, arrangement or agreement to the contrary, in the event that an
independent, nationally recognized, accounting firm which shall be designated
by the Company with the Executive's written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld) (the "Accounting Firm") shall determine that any
payment or benefit received or to be received by the Executive from the
Company or any of its affiliates or from any person who effectuates a change
in control or effective control of the Company or any of such person's
affiliates (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan,
arrangement or agreement) (all such payments and benefits, the "Total
Payments") would fail to be deductible under Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or otherwise would be subject
(in whole or part) to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the
"Excise Tax") then the Accounting Firm shall determine if the payments or
benefits to be received by the Executive that are subject to Section 280G of
the Code shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of the
Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax, but such reduction shall occur if
and only to the extent that the net amount of such Total Payments, as so
reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local
income taxes, and employment, Social Security and Medicare taxes on such
reduced Total Payments), is greater than or equal to the net amount of such
Total Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of
federal, state and local income taxes and employment, Social Security and
Medicare taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax (or any
other excise tax) to which the Executive would be subject in respect of such
unreduced Total Payments). For purposes of this Section 6(a), the above tax
amounts shall be determined by applying the highest marginal rate under
Section 1 of the Code and under state and local laws which applied (or is
likely to apply) to the Executive's taxable income for the tax year in which
the transaction which causes the application of Section 280G of the Code
occurs, or such other rate(s) as the Accounting



Firm determines to be likely to apply to the Executive in the relevant tax
year(s) in which any of the Total Payments is expected to be made. If the
Accounting Firm determines that the Executive would not retain a larger amount
on an after-tax basis if the Total Payments were so reduced, then the
Executive shall retain all of the Total Payments.

(b) Ordering of Reduction. In the case of a reduction in the Total Payments
pursuant to Section 6(a), the Total Payments will be reduced in the following
order: (i) payments that are payable in cash that are valued at full value
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, QandA 24(a) will be reduced (if
necessary, to zero), with amounts that are payable last reduced first; (ii)
payments and benefits due in respect of any equity valued at full value under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, QandA 24(a), with the highest values
reduced first (as such values are determined under Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1, QandA 24) will next be reduced; (iii) payments that are payable in
cash that are valued at less than full value under Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1, QandA 24, with amounts that are payable last reduced first, will next
be reduced; (iv) payments and benefits due in respect of any equity valued at
less than full value under Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, QandA 24, with
the highest values reduced first (as such values are determined under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1, QandA 24) will next be reduced; and (v) all other
non-cash benefits not otherwise described in clauses (ii) or (iv) will be next
reduced pro-rata.

(c) Certain Determinations. For purposes of determining whether and the extent
to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax: (i) no portion
of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which the Executive shall
have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a "payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code will be taken into account;
(ii) no portion of the Total Payments will be taken into account which, in the
opinion of tax counsel ("Tax Counsel") reasonably acceptable to the Executive
and selected by the Accounting Firm, does not constitute a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of
Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, no
portion of such Total Payments will be taken into account which, in the
opinion of Tax Counsel, constitutes reasonable compensation for services
actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in
excess of the "base amount" (as set forth in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code)
that is allocable to such reasonable compensation; and (iii) the value of any
non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total
Payments will be determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the
principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. The Executive and the
Company shall furnish such documentation and documents as may be necessary for
the Accounting Firm to perform the requisite calculations and analysis under
this Section 6 (and shall cooperate to the extent necessary for any of the
determinations in this Section 6(c) to be made), and the Accounting Firm shall
provide a written report of its determinations hereunder, including detailed
supporting calculations. If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate
Total Payments should be reduced as described above, it shall promptly notify
the Executive and the Company to that effect. In the absence of manifest
error, all determinations by the Accounting Firm under this Section 6 shall be
binding on the Executive and the Company and shall be made as soon as
reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the later
of the Executive's date of termination of employment or the date of the
transaction which causes



the application of Section 280G of the Code. The Company shall bear all costs,
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and any legal counsel retained by the
Accounting Firm.

(d) Additional Payments. If the Executive receives reduced payments and
benefits by reason of this Section 6 and it is established pursuant to a
determination of a court of competent jurisdiction which is not subject to
review or as to which the time to appeal has expired, or pursuant to an
Internal Revenue Service proceeding, that the Executive could have received a
greater amount without resulting in any Excise Tax, then the Company shall
thereafter pay the Executive the aggregate additional amount which could have
been paid without resulting in any Excise Tax as soon as reasonably
practicable following such determination.

CHANGE IN CONTROL. 

(a) Equity Awards Fully Vest. Except as otherwise provided in the documents
governing the Sign-on Equity Award, on the effective date of any Change in
Control, all equity or equity based awards relating to the securities of the
Company and any Fund Incentives held by the Executive that are outstanding and
unvested shall fully vest.

(b) Definition of Change in Control. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Change in Control" shall have the meaning provided for in the Colony Capital,
Inc. 2014 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan.

8.

|

ASSIGNMENT; ASSUMPTION OF AGREEMENT. No right, benefit or interest hereunder
shall be subject to assignment, encumbrance, charge, pledge, hypothecation or
setoff by the Executive in respect of any claim, debt, obligation or similar
process. This Agreement may not be assigned by CLNY and CLNY will require any
successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the
Company to assume expressly and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same
manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it
if no such succession had taken place. 

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

PERMITTED TRANSFERS. CLNY acknowledges and agrees that any transfer of OP
Common Units (as defined in the LLC Agreement of the Operating Entity) held by
Executive in compliance with the lock-up agreements applicable thereto will be
deemed to constitute a transfer that is "expressly authorized" under a Non-
Managing Ancillary Agreement and shall constitute a "Permitted Transfer" for
purposes of the LLC Agreement of the Operating Entity.

(e) Survival. The representations, warranties and covenants of the Executive
contained in this Agreement will survive any termination of the Executive's
employment with the Company.

(f) Amendment; Waiver. No provision of this Agreement may be amended,
modified, waived or discharged unless such amendment, modification, waiver or
discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and CLNY. No
waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party

performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver



of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior
or subsequent time. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein
shall terminate automatically without any further action by any party upon the

(g) Further Assurances. The parties hereto will from time to time after the

instruments and take such other actions as any other party may reasonably
request in order to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

(h) Severability. If any term or provision hereof is determined to be invalid
or unenforceable in a final court or arbitration proceeding, (i) the remaining
terms and provisions hereof shall be unimpaired and (ii) to the extent
permitted by applicable law, the invalid or unenforceable term or provision
shall be deemed replaced by a term or provision that is valid and enforceable
and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision.

(i) Arbitration. Except as otherwise set forth in the Restrictive Covenant
Agreement, any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this
Agreement that cannot be mutually resolved by the parties hereto shall be
settled exclusively by arbitration in Los Angeles, California, before a panel
of three neutral arbitrators, each of whom shall be selected jointly by the
parties, or, if the parties cannot agree on the selection of the arbitrators,
as selected by the American Arbitration Association. The commercial
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA Rules")
shall govern any arbitration between the parties, except that the following
provisions are included in the parties' agreement to arbitrate and override
any contrary provisions in the AAA Rules:

(i) The agreement to arbitrate and the rights of the parties hereunder shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
California, without regard to conflict or choice of law rules;

(ii) The California Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitration, the
agreement to arbitrate, and any proceedings to enforce, confirm, modify or
vacate the award;

(iii) The arbitrators shall apply California law;

(iv) Any petition or motion to modify or vacate the award shall be filed in a
Superior Court in California (the "Court");

(iv)The award shall be written, reasoned, and shall include findings of fact
as to all factual issues and conclusions of law as to all legal issues;

(v)Either party may seek a de novo review by the Court of the conclusions of
law included in the award and any petition or motion to enforce, confirm,
modify or vacate the award; and

(vi)The arbitration shall be confidential. Judgment may be entered on the
arbitrators' award in any court having jurisdiction.

The parties hereby agree that the arbitrators shall be empowered to enter an
equitable decree mandating specific enforcement of the terms of this
Agreement. Each party shall bear its



own legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in any arbitration
hereunder and the parties shall share equally all expenses of the arbitrators;
provided, that, the arbitrator shall have the same authority to award
reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party in any arbitration as part
of the arbitrator's award as would be the case had the dispute or controversy
been argued before a court with competent jurisdiction.

(j) Section 409A. The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits
under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent
subject thereto, and accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this
Agreement shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith.
In the event that any provision of Agreement or any other agreement or award
referenced herein is mutually agreed by the parties to be in violation of
Section 409A of the Code, the parties shall cooperate reasonably to attempt to
amend or modify this Agreement (or other agreement or award) in order to avoid
a violation of Section 409A of the Code while attempting to preserve the
economic intent of the applicable provision. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the Executive shall not be considered to
have terminated employment with the Company for purposes of any payments under
this Agreement which are subject to Section 409A of the Code until the
Executive would be considered to have incurred a "separation from service"
from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Each amount
to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed
as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.
Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained herein
to the contrary, to the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation
and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would
otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to
this Agreement or any other arrangement between the Executive and the Company
during the six-month period immediately following the Executive's separation
from service shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date
that is six months following the Executive's separation from service (or, if
earlier, the Executive's date of death). To the extent required to avoid an
accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, amounts
reimbursable to the Executive under this Agreement shall be paid to the
Executive on or before the last day of the year following the year in which
the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement
(and in kind benefits provided to the Executive) during one year may not
affect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year. CLNY makes no
representation that any or all of the payments described in this Agreement
will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code and makes no
undertaking to preclude Section 409A of the Code from applying to any such
payment. For purposes of this Section 10(j), Section 409A of the Code shall
include all regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder.

(k) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only and shall
not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

(l) Construction. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement is the result of
arm's-length negotiations between sophisticated parties, each afforded
representation by legal counsel. Each and every provision of this Agreement
shall be construed as though both parties participated equally in the drafting
of the same, and any rule of construction that a document shall be construed
against the drafting party shall not be applicable to this Agreement.



(m) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but both such
counterparts shall together constitute one and the same document.

(n) Tax Withholding. The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under
this Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes as the Company is
required to withhold pursuant to any applicable law, regulation or ruling.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not
be obligated to guarantee any particular tax result for the Executive with
respect to any payment provided to the Executive hereunder, and the Executive
shall be responsible for any taxes imposed on Executive with respect to any
such payment.

(o) Cooperation. For a period of 12 months following the termination of the
Executive's employment with the Company for any reason, the Executive shall
provide reasonable cooperation in connection with any action or proceeding (or
any appeal from any action or proceeding) which relates to events during the
Executive's employment hereunder of which the Executive has knowledge. The
Company shall reimburse the Executive for the Executive's reasonable travel
expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing, in accordance with the
Company's policies (and consistent with the Executive's travel practices
during the Executive's employment with the Company) and subject to the
delivery of reasonable support for such expenses. Any such requests for
cooperation shall be subject to the Executive's business and personal schedule
and the Executive shall not be required to cooperate against his own legal
interests or the legal interests of his employer or partners or business
ventures. In the event the Executive reasonably determines that he needs
separate legal counsel in connection with his cooperation, the Company shall
reimburse the Executive for the reasonable costs of such counsel as soon as
practicable (and in any event within 30 days) following its receipt of an
invoice for such costs. In the event the Executive is required to cooperate
for more than 8 hours in any 12-month period, the Executive shall be paid an
hourly consulting fee in an amount mutually agreed between the Company and
Executive at the time.

(p) Effectiveness. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein
shall be conditioned upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement. In the event that the Purchase Agreement terminates prior
to the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby, this Agreement shall
automatically terminate without any further action by any party and shall be
void ab initio.

EXECUTIVE'S GENERAL RELEASE OF CLAIMS. 

 

(a) Waiver and Release. Pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) of the Employment
Agreement, and in consideration of the Post-Termination Benefits to be
provided to Executive as outlined in the Employment Agreement and this Release
as set forth herein, Executive, on behalf of himself and his heirs, executors,
administrators and assigns, forever waives, releases and discharges Employer,
its officers, directors, owners, shareholders and agents (collectively
referred to herein as, the "Employer Group"), and each of its and their
respective officers, directors, shareholders, members, managers, employees,
agents, servants, accountants, attorneys, heirs, beneficiaries, successors and
assigns (together with the Employer Group, the "Employer Released Parties"),
from any and all claims, demands, causes of actions, fees, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of any kind whatsoever,
whether known or unknown, that Executive has ever had or might have against
the Employer Released Parties that directly or indirectly arise out of, relate
to, or are connected with, Executive's services to, or employment by the
Company, including, but not limited to (i) any claims under Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act, as amended, the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended,
the Family and Medical Leave Act, as amended, the Fair Labor Standards Act, as
amended, the Equal Pay Act, as amended, the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act, as amended (with respect to unvested benefits), the Civil Rights
Act of 1991, as amended, Section 1981 of Title 42 of the United States Code,
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, as amended, the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act,
as amended, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, as amended, and
the California Labor Code, as amended, and/or any other federal, state or
local law (statutory, regulatory or otherwise) that may be legally waived and
released and (ii) any tort and/or contract claims, including any claims of
wrongful discharge, defamation, emotional distress,



tortious interference with contract, invasion of privacy, nonphysical injury,
personal injury or sickness or any other harm. Executive acknowledges that if
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other administrative agency
brings any charge or complaint on his behalf or for his benefit, this Release
bars Executive from receiving, and Executive hereby waives any right to, any
monetary or other individual relief related to such a charge or complaint.
This Release, however, excludes (i) any claims made under state workers'
compensation or unemployment laws, and/or any claims that cannot be waived by
law, (ii) claims with respect to the breach of any covenant (including any
payments under the Employment Agreement) to be performed by Employer after the
date of this Release, (iii) any rights to indemnification or contribution or
directors' and officers' liability insurance under the Employment Agreement,
Indemnification Agreement, any operative documents of the Company or any
applicable law, (iv) any claims as a holder of Company equity awards under the
Company's equity incentive plans or as a holder of Fund Incentives; (v) any
claims for vested benefits under any employee benefit plan (excluding any
severance plan and including claims under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985) or any claims that may arise after the date
Executive signs the Release; and (vi) any claims with respect to the breach of
any covenant of the Employer or any of its controlled affiliates under the
Purchase Agreement or the operating agreement of CCOC in effect from time to
time.



(b) Waiver of Unknown Claims; Section 1542. Executive intends to fully waive
and release all claims against Employer; therefore, he expressly understands
and hereby agrees that this Release is intended to cover, and does cover, not
only all known injuries, losses or damages, but any injuries, losses or
damages that he does not now know about or anticipate, but that might later
develop or be discovered, including the effects and consequences of those
injuries, losses or damages. Executive expressly waives the benefits of and
right to relief under California Civil Code Section 1542 ("Section 1542"), or
any similar statute or comparable common law doctrine in any jurisdiction.
Section 1542 provides:



Section 1542. (General Release-Claims Extinguished) A general release does not
extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect
to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if
known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with
the debtor or released party.



Executive understands and acknowledges the significance and consequences of
this specific waiver of Section 1542 and, having had the opportunity to
consult with legal counsel, hereby knowingly and voluntarily waives and
relinquishes any rights and/or benefits which he may have thereunder. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Executive acknowledges that by
accepting the benefits and payments offered in exchange for this Release, he
assumes and waives the risks that the facts and the law may be other than he
believes and that, after signing this Release, he may discover losses or
claims that are released under this Release, but that are presently unknown to
him, and he understands and agrees that this Release shall apply to any such
losses or claims.



(c) Acknowledgement of ADEA Waiver. Without in any way limiting the scope of
the foregoing general release of claims, Executive acknowledges that he is
waiving and releasing any rights he may have under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967 (the "ADEA") and that such waiver and release is
knowing and voluntary. This waiver and release does not govern



any rights or claims that might arise under the ADEA after the date this
Release is signed by Executive. Executive acknowledges that: (i) the
consideration given for this Release is in addition to anything of value to
which Executive otherwise would be entitled to receive; (ii) he has been
advised in writing to consult with an attorney of his choice prior to signing
this Release; (iii) he has been provided a full and ample opportunity to
review this Release, including a period of at least twenty-one (21) days
within which to consider it (which will not be lengthened by any revisions or
modifications); (iv) he has read and fully understands this Release and has
had the opportunity to discuss it with an attorney of his choice; (v) to the
extent that Executive takes less than twenty-one (21) days to consider this
Release prior to execution, he acknowledges that he had sufficient time to
consider this Release with counsel and that he expressly, voluntarily and
knowingly waives any additional time; and (vi) Executive is aware of his right
to revoke this Release at any time within the seven (7)-day period following
the date on which he executes this Release. Executive further understands that
he shall relinquish any right he has to Post- Termination Benefits described
in the Employment Agreement if he exercises his right to revoke this Release.
Notice of revocation must be made in writing and must be received by [Name,
Title], no later than 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the seventh (7th) calendar day
immediately after the day on which Executive executes this Release.



4.NO CLAIMS BY EXECUTIVE. Executive affirms and warrants that he has not
filed, initiated or caused to be filed or initiated any claim, charge, suit,
complaint, grievance, action or cause of action against Employer or any of the
other Employer Released Parties (except to the extent allowed by Section 7
below).



5.NO ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS. Executive affirms and warrants that he has made no
assignment of any right or interest in any claim which he may have against any
of the Employer Released Parties.



6.ADVICE OF COUNSEL. Executive acknowledges: (a) that he has been advised to
consult with an attorney regarding this Release; (b) that he has, in fact,
consulted with an attorney regarding this Release; (c) that he has carefully
read and understands all of the provisions of this Release; and (d) that he is
knowingly and voluntarily executing this Release in consideration of the Post-
Termination Benefits provided under the Employment Agreement.



7.NO WAIVER OF CLAIMS RELATING TO PURCHASE AGREEMENT. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Executive does not waive any claims, demands, causes of actions,
fees, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of any
kind whatsoever, whether known or unknown, that Executive has ever had or
might have against the Employer Released Parties that directly or indirectly
arise out of, relate to, or are connected with, the Purchase Agreement or the
operating agreement of CCOC in effect from time to time.

Execution Version

RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT

THIS RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of July 25,
2019, and effective as of the Effective Date (as defined below), is made by
and between Colony Capital, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("CLNY"), and Marc
Ganzi ("Executive"). CLNY, together with its Subsidiaries (which, following
the Effective Date, shall include DBH (as defined below) and its subsidiaries)
is hereinafter referred to as "the Company," and where the context permits,
references to "the Company" shall include the Company and any successor to the
Company. Any capitalized term that is used but not otherwise defined in this
Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in the Purchase Agreement (as
defined below).



WHEREAS, Executive has on the date hereof entered into a Contribution and

by the Company.

(b) Executive further agrees that he will execute and deliver to CLNY any and
all further documents or instruments and do any and all further acts which the

interest, to such end. Executive shall be promptly reimbursed by the Company
for all costs and expenditures incurred in connection with any cooperation

(a) The recitals to this Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree with such recitals, and further agree
that the value of the consideration paid by the Company in connection with the

Executive and the Company agree not to challenge the enforceability of the
covenants (and the limitations and qualifications included as part thereof)
contained in this Agreement.

(d) Executive agrees to be bound by the Restrictive Covenants and the other
agreements contained in this Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by Law,

Equity Award Term Sheet





Attached hereto.











Execution Version



MARC GANZI NEW-HIRE LTIP UNIT AWARD TERM SHEET 

--- 
| 

# LTIP Units1

|

10,000,000 

Grant Date

|

Upon Mr. Ganzi's commencement of employment with CLNY, subject to approval by
the Board of Directors. 

Time-Based Vesting

|

Except as described below, Mr. Ganzi must be continuously employed by CLNY
until the date that the performance condition is satisfied, and the LTIP units
shall be forfeited immediately upon his termination of employment, unless (i)
prior to termination, the performance-vesting condition has been satisfied or
(ii) there has been a "Qualifying Termination," as described below. 

Dividends

|

Dividends are only payable once the LTIP units vest; they do not accumulate
prior to vesting. 

Performance-Based Vesting

|

The LTIP units will vest based on the achievement of CLNY's common stock
closing at or above $10.00 during regular trading on the NYSE stock exchange
over any 90 consecutive trading days (the "performance test") during the
period commencing on the grant date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the
grant date (the "performance period"). Once the LTIP units vest, they will not
become unvested regardless of whether CLNY's stock price subsequently drops
below $10.00. 

Expiration

|

Absent a Qualifying Termination, the LTIP units shall be forfeited on the
earlier of a termination of employment and the end of the performance period. 

Effect of a Qualifying Termination

|

A "Qualifying Termination" occurs if, prior to the end of the performance
period, there is a termination of Mr. Ganzi's employment by CLNY without
Cause, by Mr. Ganzi with Good Reason, or due to Mr. Ganzi's death or
Disability.* In such case, the LTIP units will remain outstanding and eligible
to vest pro rata if the performance test is achieved during the two-year
period following the termination date (including upon a CIC during such
period) (but not past the original expiration date). Proration will be
calculated based on the number of days of employment during the performance
period plus an additional 365 days (but not to exceed the total number of days
in the performance period). 

Change in Control and CLNY does not continue as surviving corporation

|

If the CIC price is ≥ $10.00, 100% of the LTIP units will vest upon the CIC.
If CIC price is equal to or greater than $8.00 but less than $10.00, 25% of
the LTIP units will vest. 

Book-up

|

The Company will maintain capital accounts in accordance with the Treasury
Regulations under Section 704(b) and allocate adjustments to the capital
accounts (for any "book-up" events) as required by such regulations. 

 

* Defined terms will have the same definitions provided for such terms in Mr. Ganzi's employment agreement.









____________________________

1At Mr. Ganzi's election, to be made no later than the earlier of (i) five
business days prior to closing and (ii) June 30, 2019, RSUs will be granted
instead of LTIP units.
