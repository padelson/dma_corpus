EXHIBITS    Exhibit A Form of Stock Option Agreement  Exhibit B Form of
Voting Agreement   -iii-  5  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER     This
AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as
of January 16, 2001, among Macromedia, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("PARENT"), Alaska Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned first-tier subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and
Allaire Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("COMPANY").   RECITALS   A.
The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company have
approved this Agreement, and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with
Company (the "MERGER") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware ("DELAWARE LAW").   B. For United States federal income tax
purposes, the Merger is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" pursuant to
the provisions of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "CODE"), except in the event that a Conversion Event (as defined
in Section 1.6) occurs. For accounting purposes, the Merger is intended to be
accounted for as a purchase under United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP").   C. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
and as a condition and inducement to Parent\'s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, Company shall execute and deliver a Stock Option Agreement in
favor of Parent in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
"STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT"). The Board of Directors of Company has approved the
Stock Option Agreement.   D. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent\'s willingness to
enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of Company are entering into
Voting Agreements with Parent in the form of Exhibit B (the "VOTING
AGREEMENT").   In consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1
The Merger. Unless the Conversion Event occurs, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law, at the Effective Time, Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub,
the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease, and Merger Sub shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger. If the Conversion Event
occurs, then upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement
and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into Company, the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall    -1-  6 cease, and Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger. The corporation surviving the Merger
shall be referred to herein as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION."   1.2 Effective
Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of
merger, in such appropriate form as determined by the parties, with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant
provisions of Delaware Law (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") (the time of such
filing (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Company and Parent
and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "EFFECTIVE TIME") as
soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date. The closing of the
Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of Fenwick and West LLP,
275 Battery Street, San Francisco, California, at a time and date to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business
day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VI, or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in
writing (the "CLOSING DATE").   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.   (a) The
Certificate of Merger shall provide that, at the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be in
substantially the form of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Merger Sub
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
as of the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation shall read: "The name of the corporation is
"Allaire Corporation."   (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.   1.5
Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
their respective successors are duly appointed.   1.6 Effect on Capital
Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the following securities:  
(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock.    -2-  7  (i) Except as provided
in Section 1.6(a)(ii), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Company ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be
canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), will be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted (subject to Section 1.6(e)) into the right to receive
(x) 0.20 (the "EXCHANGE RATIO") of a share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of Parent ("PARENT COMMON STOCK") and (y) $3.00 in cash (the "CASH
CONSIDERATION"), upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of
Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7. Unless otherwise
stated or otherwise indicated by the context, all references in this
Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement to "Company Common Stock" shall be
deemed to include the associated preferred share purchase rights ("RIGHTS")
issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2000,
between Company and Fleet Bank, N.A., as Rights Agent (the "RIGHTS
AGREEMENT"). No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by
virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made
pursuant to Section 1.7(e).   (ii) If the Conversion Event occurs, then
upon the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), will be
canceled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Section
1.6(e)) into the right to receive an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the sum of (x) the amount of cash that is the product of
(A) the Trigger Price (as defined below) multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio
(the "SUBSTITUTE CASH CONSIDERATION") plus (y) the Cash Consideration, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock
in the manner provided in Section 1.7.   (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned
and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock held by Company or
owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary
of Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.   (c) Stock
Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plan. At the Effective Time, all options to
purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding, whether under Company\'s 1997
Stock Incentive Plan, Company\'s 1998 Stock Incentive Plan or Company\'s 2000
Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the "COMPANY OPTION PLANS"), pursuant to
another Company compensatory plan or otherwise (each such option, whether
issued pursuant to the Company Option Plans or otherwise, a "COMPANY
OPTION"), and each warrant outstanding to acquire Company Common Stock (the
"COMPANY WARRANTS") shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.8
of this Agreement. Rights outstanding under Company\'s 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "COMPANY ESPP") shall be treated as set forth in Section
5.8 of this Agreement.   (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub.   (i) Except as
provided in Section 1.6(d)(ii), each share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of Merger Sub ("MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be outstanding as
one    -3-  8 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share of the Surviving Corporation.
Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares
of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (ii) If the Conversion Event occurs,
then each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
the Surviving Corporation. Following the Effective Time, each certificate
evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  
(e) Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The Exchange Ratio, the Cash
Consideration and the Substitute Cash Amount, as applicable, shall be
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like
change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring
on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   (f) As used
in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:  
(i) The "CONVERSION EVENT" shall occur if the product of (A) the Trigger
Price multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio shall be less than the amount of
the Cash Consideration.   (ii) The term "MERGER CONSIDERATION" means
the aggregate amount of consideration per share of Company Common Stock
issuable in the Merger, determined as the sum of (A) the Cash Consideration
and (B) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, determined by
application of the Exchange Ratio, or the Substitute Cash Consideration,
whichever is applicable under Section 1.6(a).   (iii) The "TRIGGER PRICE"
shall mean the closing sale price of Parent Common Stock during regular
trading hours on the Nasdaq National Market on the day which is two trading
days before the date fixed for the Company Stockholders\' Meeting in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as each such term is defined in Section
2.17).   1.7 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall
select an institution reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the exchange
agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger.   (b) Exchange Fund. As
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available
to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, the
Merger Consideration (such shares of Parent Common Stock or Substitute Cash
Consideration and Cash Consideration together with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any    -4-  9 dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND") issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock.   (c) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates ("CERTIFICATES")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock which were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration into which their shares of Company Common Stock were
converted at the Effective Time, (including, if shares of Parent Common Stock
are issued to holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger, payment in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that such holders have the right
to receive pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d)) and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence only the ownership of the Merger Consideration (which, if Parent
Common Stock is issued to holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger,
shall include the full number of shares of such Parent Common Stock together
with the right to receive any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 1.7(d)). No interest will be paid or accrued on any Cash
Consideration, Substitute Cash Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock or on any unpaid dividends or distributions
payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of Company, the Merger Consideration, including any
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of
Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.   (d) Distributions
With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. In the event that shares of Parent Common
Stock are issued to the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger, no
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of this
Agreement with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until
the holders of record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates.
If such shares of Parent Common Stock are issued, subject to applicable law,
following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver to the holders of certificates representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the
amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and
the    -5-  10 amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.   (e) Fractional Shares. In the event that Parent Common Stock is
issued to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger:   (i)
as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
shall determine the excess of (A) the number of full shares of Parent Common
Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.7(b), over (B)
the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed
to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.7(c) (such excess,
the "EXCESS SHARES"). Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as
agent for the holders of Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares
at then prevailing prices on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the manner set forth
in paragraph (ii) of this Section 1.7(e).   (ii) The sale of the excess
shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and
shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the
Excess Shares as promptly following the Effective Time as, in the Exchange
Agent\'s reasonable judgment, is practicable consistent with obtaining the
best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until
the net proceeds of such sales have been distributed to the holders of
Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for
the holders of Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent will determine the
portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of Company Common Stock
shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net
proceeds by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional
share interest to which such holder of Company Common Stock is entitled
(after taking into account all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to
such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of Company Common Stock are
entitled. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock with respect
to fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such
amounts to such holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of Section 1.7(c).   (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs
(i) and (ii) of this Section 1.7(e), Parent may decide, at its option,
exercised prior to the Effective Time, in lieu of the issuance and sale of
Excess Shares and the making of the payments contemplated in such
paragraphs, that Parent shall pay to the Exchange Agent an amount sufficient
for the Exchange Agent to pay each holder of Company Common Stock the amount
such holder would have received pursuant to Section 1.7(e)(ii) assuming that
the sales of Parent Common Stock were made at a price equal to the average of
the closing prices of the Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market for
the five consecutive trading days immediately following the Effective Time
and, in such case, all references herein to the cash proceeds of the sale of
the Excess Shares and similar references shall be deemed to mean and refer to
the payments calculated as set forth    -6-  11 in this paragraph (iii).
In such event, Excess Shares shall not be issued or otherwise transferred to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to Sections 1.7(b) or (e).   (f) Required
Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local
or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement (as
defined in Section 2.2(c)). To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.   (g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section
1.6, including, if applicable, cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be
required pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); provided, however, that Parent may, in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such Merger
Consideration, cash and other distributions, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   (h) No
Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7,
neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or rights
to other Merger Consideration or of Company Common Stock for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.   (i) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of
Company Common Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who
have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this Section 1.7 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration to which they are
entitled including, if applicable, any dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
1.7(d) and, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(e), in each case, without any
interest thereon.   1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.
All Merger Consideration issued in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any shares of Parent Common Stock and cash paid in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 1.7(d) and (e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the    -7-  12 Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the
Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
I.   1.9 Restricted Stock. If any shares of Company Common Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
providing that such shares ("COMPANY RESTRICTED STOCK") may be forfeited or
repurchased by Company upon any termination of the stockholders\' employment,
directorship or other relationship with Company (and/or any affiliate of
Company) under the terms of any restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement with Company that does not by its terms provide that such
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition fully lapses upon
consummation of the Merger, then (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issued
upon the conversion of such shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger will
continue to be unvested and subject to the same repurchase options, risks of
forfeiture or other conditions following the Effective Time, and the
certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly
be marked with appropriate legends noting such repurchase options, risks of
forfeiture or other conditions and (ii) any cash payable upon the conversion
of such shares of Company Restricted Stock in the Merger will be paid to each
holder of such shares upon the vesting or lapse of the right of repurchase
thereof. Company shall take all actions that may be necessary to ensure that,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such
repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement. A listing of the holders of Company
Restricted Stock, together with the number of shares and the vesting schedule
of Company Restricted Stock held by each, is set forth in Part 1.9 of the
Company Disclosure Letter.   1.10 Tax and Accounting Consequences.   (a)
Unless the Conversion Event occurs, it is intended by the parties hereto that
the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code. Unless the Conversion Event occurs, the parties hereto adopt
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Income Tax Regulations.  
(b) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall be treated for
accounting purposes as a purchase.   1.11 Taking of Necessary Action;
Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action
is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and
Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Company and Merger Sub will take
all such lawful and necessary action. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform all of its obligations relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.    -8-  13  ARTICLE II

Governmental Entity or any arbitrator that seeks to restrain or enjoin the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or which

such claims, actions or proceedings, to be material to Parent or have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the parties hereto to consummate
the Merger.   3.7 Disclosure. The information supplied by Parent for
inclusion in the Registration Statement shall not at the time the
Registration Statement is filed with the SEC and at the time it becomes

postpone the Company Stockholders\' Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure
that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
is provided to Company\'s stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger and
this Agreement or, if as of the time for which Company Stockholders\' Meeting
is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus)
there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting. Company shall ensure that the Company

that all proxies solicited by the Company in connection with the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting are solicited, in compliance with the Delaware Law,
its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, the rules of the Nasdaq Stock
Market and all other applicable legal requirements. Company\'s obligation to
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting in
accordance with this Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to
Company of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Offer, or by any withdrawal,
amendment or modification of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
Company with respect to this Agreement or the Merger, and the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting shall be called, noticed, convened and held prior to
the calling, noticing, convening or holding of any meeting of Company\'s
stockholders to consider approval of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior
Offer.   (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Board of Directors of
Company shall recommend that Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of
and adopt and approve this Agreement and approve the Merger at the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting; (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of Company has
recommended that Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and
approve this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting;
and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof
shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of Company that Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of and adopt
and approve this Agreement and the Merger.   (c) Nothing in this Agreement
shall prevent the Board of Directors of Company from withholding,
withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation in favor of the Merger
if (i) a Superior Offer (as defined below) is made to Company and is not
withdrawn, (ii) Company shall have provided written notice to Parent (a
"NOTICE OF SUPERIOR OFFER") advising Parent that Company has received a
Superior Offer, specifying all of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Offer and identifying the person or entity making such Superior
Offer, (iii) Parent shall not have, within five business days of Parent\'s
receipt of the Notice of Superior Offer, made an offer that Company\'s Board
of Directors by a majority vote determines in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with a financial advisor of national standing) to be at least as
favorable to Company\'s stockholders as such Superior Offer (it being   
-39-  44 agreed that the Board of Directors of Company shall convene a
meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly following the receipt
thereof), (iv) the Board of Directors of Company reasonably concludes, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer,
the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification of such recommendation
is required in order for the Board of Directors of Company to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to Company\'s stockholders under applicable law and (v)
Company shall not have violated any of the restrictions set forth in Section
5.4 or this Section 5.2. Company shall provide Parent with at least two
business days prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the
members of Company\'s Board of Directors) of any meeting of Company\'s Board
of Directors at which Company\'s Board of Directors is reasonably expected to
consider any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.4) to determine
whether such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer. Nothing contained in
this Section 5.2(c) shall limit Company\'s obligation to hold and convene the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting (regardless of whether the recommendation of
the Board of Directors of Company shall have been withdrawn, amended or
modified).   For purposes of this Agreement, "SUPERIOR OFFER" shall mean an
unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party to consummate
any of the following transactions: (i) a merger or consolidation involving
Company pursuant to which the stockholders of Company immediately
preceding such transaction hold less than 50% of the equity interest in the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or (ii) the acquisition by
any person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder) (including by way of a tender offer or
an exchange offer or a two step transaction involving a tender offer followed
with reasonable promptness by a cash-out merger involving Company), directly
or indirectly, of ownership of 100% of the then outstanding shares of capital
stock of Company, on terms that the Board of Directors of Company determines,
in its reasonable judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of
national standing) to be more favorable to the Company stockholders than the
terms of the Merger; provided, however, that any such offer shall not be
deemed to be a "Superior Offer" if any financing required to consummate the
transaction contemplated by such offer is not committed (and Company provides
Parent with written evidence of such commitment) and is not likely in the
reasonable judgment of Company\'s Board of Directors (after consultation with
its financial advisor) to be obtained by such third party on a timely
basis.   (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company or
its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, provided, however, that the Board of Directors of Company

furnishing nonpublic information regarding Company and its subsidiaries to,
or entering into discussions with, any person or group who has submitted (and
not withdrawn) to Company an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company reasonably concludes (after

Superior Offer if (1) neither Company nor any representative of Company and
its subsidiaries shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.4, (2) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action is
required in order for the Board of Directors of Company to comply with
its fiduciary obligations to Company\'s stockholders under applicable law,

any such discussions with, such person or group, Company gives Parent written
notice of the identity of such person or group and all of the material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of Company\'s intention to
furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such person
or group, and    -41-  46 Company receives from such person or group an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive
with regard to Company\'s confidential information as the Confidentiality
Agreement, (4) Company gives Parent at least two business days advance notice
of its intent to furnish such nonpublic information or enter into such
discussions, and (5) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such person or group, Company furnishes such nonpublic
information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously furnished by Company to Parent). Company and its subsidiaries will
immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or

any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding two sentences by
any officer, director or employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries

Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.4 by Company.   For purposes of this Agreement, "ACQUISITION
PROPOSAL" shall mean any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal
by Parent) relating to, or involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase by any

required by law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange.
The parties have agreed to the text of the joint press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement.    -42-  47  5.6 Reasonable Efforts;

instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates

agreements or submit to orders providing for the sale or other disposition or
holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
assets or categories of assets of Parent or any of its affiliates or Company
or any of its subsidiaries or the holding separate of the shares of Company
Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or imposing or
seeking to impose any limitation on the ability of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates to conduct their business or own such assets or to

Common Stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation).   (b) Each
of Company and Parent will give prompt notice to the other of (i) any notice
or other communication from any person alleging that the consent of such
person is or may be required in connection with the Merger, (ii) any notice
or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the

untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Company to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement. Parent shall give prompt notice to Company of
any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent or Merger
Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition

to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.   5.8 Stock Options; Warrants and ESPP.   (a) At the
Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether or not then
exercisable, will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Option so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock Option
Plan, if any, pursuant to which the Company Option was issued and any option
agreement between Company and the optionee with regard to the Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any
repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each Company
Stock Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance
with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below),
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. Continuous employment with Company or its subsidiaries shall be
credited to the optionee for purposes of determining the vesting of all
assumed Company Options after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "OPTION EXCHANGE RATIO" means, in the event that the
Conversion Event does not occur, the sum obtained by adding (x) the Exchange
Ratio plus (y) the quotient (rounded to the third decimal place) obtained by
dividing (i) the Cash Consideration by (ii) the average of the closing sale
prices of Parent Common Stock during regular trading hours on the Nasdaq
National Market on five trading days ending on the trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the "CLOSING PRICE"); and if the Conversion Event
does occur, the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the sum of (I) the
Substitute Cash Consideration plus (II) the Cash Consideration by (B) the
Closing Price.   (b) It is intended that Company Options assumed by
Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options
as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent Company Options qualified
as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the
provisions of this Section 5.8 shall be applied consistent with such
intent.   (c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Warrant,
whether or not then exercisable, will be assumed by Parent. Each Company
Warrant so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions set    -44-  49 forth in the
applicable Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including, without limitation, any vesting provisions), except that: if
the Conversion Event does not occur, each Company Warrant will be exercisable
(or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) to purchase (i)
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Company Warrant multiplied by (B) the Exchange
Ratio, plus (ii) an amount of cash equal to (C) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company Warrant multiplied by (D) the
Cash Consideration (rounded to the nearest whole cent), at a per share of
Parent Common Stock (and pro rata portion of the aggregate cash receivable
pursuant to such assumed Company Warrant) exercise price equal to the
aggregate exercise price of the Company Warrant divided by the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the assumed Company Warrant
following such conversion; and if the Conversion Event occurs, each Company
Warrant will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with
its terms) on a per former share of Company Common Stock basis to purchase an
amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the sum of (E)
the Cash Consideration plus (F) the Substitute Cash Consideration, at a per
former share of Company Common Stock exercise price equal to the per share of
Company Common Stock exercise price of such Company Warrant immediately
prior to the Effective Time.   (d) If, at the Effective Time, there is an
offering in effect under the Company ESPP, all rights to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock shall be converted into rights to purchase a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company
ESPP.   5.9 Form S-8. Parent agrees to file a registration statement on
Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
assumed Company Options and with respect to the Company ESPP promptly, but in
no event later than five business days, following the Effective Time and
shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement thereafter
for so long as any of such options or other rights remain outstanding.  
5.10 Indemnification.   (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of Company pursuant to any indemnification agreement between
Company and any person who served as a director of officer of Company at any
time prior to the Effective Time (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") and any
indemnification provisions under Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of five years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required
by law.    -45-  50  (b) For a period of five years after the Effective
Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect
Company\'s existing officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policy on
terms comparable to those currently in effect, provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of comparable coverage
containing terms and conditions that are not substantively less advantageous
to the beneficiaries thereof, and provided, further, that in no event will
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of 150%
of the annual premium currently paid by Company for any such coverage (or to
provide more than such coverage as is available for such 150% of such annual
premium).   (c) This Section 5.10 shall survive the consummation of
the Merger, is intended to benefit the Surviving Corporation and each
Indemnified Party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified
Parties. Parent hereby guarantees to each person to whom the Surviving
Corporation has obligations under this Section 5.10 that the Surviving
Corporation will fulfill those obligations and agrees that each of those
persons is an intended beneficiary of that guarantee and has the right to
enforce it against Parent, with regard to himself or herself.   5.11 Nasdaq

Directors of Company shall take all further action (in addition to that
referred to in Section 2.20) necessary (including redeeming the Rights
immediately prior to the Effective Time or amending the Rights Agreement) in
order to render the Rights inapplicable to the Merger, and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement.
If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Stock Option
Agreement, each of Parent and Company and their respective Boards of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such lawful actions as are
necessary to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement or the Stock Option
Agreement, as applicable, and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute and any regulations promulgated thereunder on
such transactions.   5.13 Certain Employee Benefits. As soon as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, Company and Parent shall confer and
work together in good faith to agree upon mutually acceptable employee
benefit and compensation arrangements (and terminate Company Employee Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time if appropriate). Company shall take
all action necessary in advance of the Effective Time to terminate its and
its subsidiaries\' 401(k) plans effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time. To the extent that Company employees become eligible to participate in
any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent and such
plans by their terms so permit, Parent will give such employees full credit
for purposes of eligibility (including service and waiting period
requirements), vesting, benefit accrual, and determination of the level of
benefits under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by
Parent, for such employee\'s service with Company or any of its    -46- 
51 subsidiaries to the same extent recognized by either Company or its
subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.   5.14 Company

Merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action is final
and nonappealable;   (d) by either Company or Parent, if the approval
and adoption of this Agreement, and the approval of the Merger, by the
stockholders of Company shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure
to obtain the required vote at a meeting of Company stockholders duly
convened therefore or at any adjournment thereof; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) shall not be
available to Company where the failure to obtain the Company stockholder
approval shall have been caused by (i) the action or failure to act of
Company and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach by
Company of this Agreement or (ii) a breach of any of the Voting Agreements by
any party thereto other than Parent;   (e) by Parent (at any time prior to
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the required
vote of the stockholders of Company) if a Triggering Event (as defined below)
shall have occurred;   (f) by Company, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent shall
have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of
such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have
become untrue, provided that if such inaccuracy in Parent\'s representations
and warranties or breach by Parent is curable by Parent, then Company may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(f) for 30 days after delivery
of written notice from Company to Parent of such breach, provided Parent
continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it
being understood that Company may not terminate this    -51- 
56 Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (f) if such breach by Parent is
cured during such 30-day period, or if Company shall have materially breached
this Agreement); or   (g) by Parent, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Company set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Company
shall have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth
in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) would not be satisfied as of the time of
such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have
become untrue, provided that if such inaccuracy in Company\'s representations
and warranties or breach by Company is curable by Company, then Parent may
not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(g) for 30 days after
delivery of written notice from Parent to Company of such breach, provided
Company continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
breach (it being understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this paragraph (g) if such breach by Company is cured during such
30-day period, or if Parent shall have materially breached this
Agreement).   For the purposes of this Agreement, a "TRIGGERING
EVENT" shall be deemed to have occurred if: (i) the Board of Directors of
Company or any committee thereof shall for any reason have withdrawn or shall
have amended or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its recommendation in
favor of the adoption and approval of the Agreement or the approval of the
Merger; (ii) Company shall have failed to include in the Proxy

following the public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal; (iv) the Board
of Directors of Company or any committee thereof shall have approved or
publicly recommended any Acquisition Proposal; (v) Company shall have entered
into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement, contract or
commitment accepting any Acquisition Proposal; (vi) Company shall have
materially breached any of the provisions of Sections 5.2, 5.4 or 5.12; or
(vii) a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of Company shall have
been commenced by a person unaffiliated with Parent, and Company shall not
have sent to its securityholders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, within 10 business days after such tender or exchange offer is
first published sent or given, a statement disclosing that Company recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer.   7.2 Notice of Termination;
Effect of Termination. Any proper termination of this Agreement under Section
7.1 will be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the
terminating party to the other parties hereto. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement
shall be of no further force or effect, except (i) as set forth in this
Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article 8, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
party from liability for any willful breach of any covenant of this Agreement
or for any intentional or willful act or omission by a party which renders
any representations or warranties of such party untrue. No termination of
this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in
the    -52-  57 Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.   7.3
Fees and Expenses.   (a) Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that
Parent and Company shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than
attorneys\' and accountants fees and expenses, incurred in relation to the
printing and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including
any preliminary materials related thereto) and the Registration Statement
(including financial statements and exhibits) and any amendments or
supplements thereto.   (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated
by Parent or Company, as applicable, pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or Section
7.1(e), Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after the
date of such termination, pay Parent a fee equal to $10,350,000 in
immediately available funds (the "TERMINATION FEE"); provided, that in the
case of a termination under Section 7.1(d) prior to which no Triggering Event
has occurred, (i) such payment shall be made only if (A) following the date
of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a person
has publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal and (B) within 12 months
following the termination of this Agreement a Company Acquisition (as defined
below) is consummated or Company enters into a letter of intent or other
agreement providing for a Company Acquisition and (ii) such payment shall be
made promptly, but in no event later than two days after the consummation of
such Company Acquisition or the entry by Company into such agreement.   
(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Company under Section 7.1(f) then
Parent shall pay to Company no later than two days after demand by Company
therefor together with a statement from Company\'s Chief Financial Offer
certifying the amount thereof, Company\'s fees and expenses (including fees
of attorneys, accountants and financial advisors to Company) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, up
to an aggregate amount of such fees and expenses not to
exceed $1,000,000.    (d) If this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent

than two days after demand by Parent therefor together with a statement from
Parent\'s Chief Financial Offer certifying the amount thereof, Parent\'s fees
and expenses (including fees of attorneys, accountants and financial advisors
to Parent) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, up to an aggregate amount of such fees and expenses not
to exceed $1,000,000; provided, however, that in the event that this
Agreement is terminated and, pursuant to Section 7.3(b), Parent has received
the full amount of the Termination Fee, Parent\'s fees and expenses which are
payable under this Section 7.3(d) shall not include the fees of Parent\'s
financial advisor Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc., incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    -53-  58  (e) Each of
Parent and Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor Company would enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent or Company fails to pay in a
timely manner amounts due pursuant to Section 7.3(b), 7.3(c) or 7.3(d), and,
in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Company makes a claim for such
amounts that results in a judgment against the other for the amounts
described in Section 7.3(b), 7.3(c) or 7.3(d), the judgment debtor shall pay
to judgment creditor its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses as provided in Section 8.7(b)) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amounts described in Section
7.3(b), 7.3(c) and 7.3(d) (at the prime rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made) from such date until
the payment of such amount (together with such accrued interest). Payment of
the fees described in this Section 7.3(b), 7.3(c) and/or 7.3(d) shall not be
in lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach of this Agreement as
described in clause (ii) of Section 7.2.   For the purposes of this
Agreement, "COMPANY ACQUISITION" shall mean any of the following transactions
(other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); (i) a merger,

representing in excess of 50% of the aggregate fair market value of

beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding
shares of capital stock of Company.   7.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable
law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time by
execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent and
Company.   7.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time

hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in

such right.    -54-  59  ARTICLE VIII  GENERAL PROVISIONS   8.1 Non-
