event no later than the fifth (5th)  Business Day, after the satisfaction or,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waiver of all of the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE VII_ (other than those conditions  that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law and this Agreement, waiver of such
conditions thereat) at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth

108(2) of the Bermuda Companies Act and (c) cause to be included in the Merger
Application a request that the Registrar issue the certificate of merger with

ARTICLE II

 


 

 

EFFECT ON THE SHARE CAPITAL OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES

 


 

 

Section 2.01. _Effect on Share Capital_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent Parties, the
Company, the holders of any Class A common shares, par value $0.01 per
share,  of the Company (the " _Class A Shares_ "), the holders of any Class B
common shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Class B
Shares_ " and, together with the Class A Shares, the " _Company Shares_ ") or
the holders of any common shares, par value $0.01 per  share, of Merger Sub
(" _Merger Sub Shares_ "):

 


 

 

(a) _Share Capital of Merger Sub_. Each Merger Sub Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
cancelled and converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable Class
A  common shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company such
that, when taken together with any Class A Shares that remain outstanding
immediately following the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ will
equal the aggregate number of Class A Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 


 

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares; Treatment of Class B Shares; Treatment
of Parent-Owned Shares and Shares Owned by Company Subsidiaries_.

 


 

 

(i) All Company Shares issued and  outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time that (A) are owned by the Company as treasury shares or (B) are
owned by any Parent Party shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered  in exchange therefor nor any
repayment of capital be made in respect thereof.

 


 

 

(ii) All Class B Shares issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding as Class B common shares, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company and shall be unaffected by the
Merger.

 


 

 

(iii) All Company Shares issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company (other than any Class B Shares, which shall be
treated pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)(ii)_ ) and all Company Shares owned by
any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent (other than Holding or Merger Sub)
shall remain outstanding as shares of the same class of the Surviving
Company  and shall be unaffected by the Merger except that the number of
shares of the Surviving Company represented thereby shall be adjusted as
necessary such that each entity owns the same percentage of the outstanding
shares of such class of the  Surviving Company immediately following the
Effective Time as such entity owned of such class of Company Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor nor any repayment of capital be  made in
respect thereof.

 


 

 

 

3  

(c) _Conversion of Class A Shares_. Each Class A Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Class A Shares to be
cancelled or to remain outstanding in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_ and
Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated pursuant to _Section 2.03_ ) shall
be  automatically converted into and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to $25.00 per Class A Share, without
interest (the " _Per Share Merger  Consideration_ " and in the aggregate for
all such Class A Shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Subject to _Section
2.03_ with respect to Dissenting Shares, at and as of the Effective Time, all
such Class A Shares shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each  holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced ownership
of any Class A Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") or person entered on the transfer
records  of the Company as the owner in book-entry of any uncertificated
Class A Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ")             shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pertaining to the Class A Shares represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, without interest, upon the
surrender  thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02_.

 


 

 

Section 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 


 

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Parent Parties shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment and delivery to 
holders of Class A Shares of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to
such holders in connection with the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ and
_Section 2.03(a)_ (the " _Paying Agent_ "). In connection therewith, prior to
the Closing Date, the  Parent Parties shall enter into an agreement with the
Paying Agent for its services in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company.
At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent Parties shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying  Agent an amount in cash sufficient to pay
the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Class A Shares hereunder
(such cash, together with any amounts deposited pursuant to the immediately
following sentence, being hereinafter referred to as  the " _Payment Fund_
"). If for any reason the Payment Fund is at any time inadequate to pay all
amounts to which holders of Class A Shares shall be entitled under _Section
2.01(c)_ and _Section 2.03(a)_ , including as a result of any investment
losses, the Parent  Parties shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional cash with the Paying Agent so that the Payment Fund is at all times
sufficient to make all payments to the former holders of Class A Shares of the
aggregate Merger Consideration  they are entitled to in respect thereof. The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than the payment to
holders of Class A Shares of the Merger Consideration or payment to the
Surviving Company as contemplated in _Section 2.02(f)_.

 


 

 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after the
Closing Date), the Parent Parties shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to 
each holder of record of a Certificate a form of letter of transmittal, which
shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as the Parent
Parties may specify (subject to the Company's reasonable approval thereof) and
shall be  prepared prior to the Closing, but which shall in any event
specify, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent,  together with instructions thereto (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ").

 


 

 

 

4  

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. In the case
of Class A Shares represented by Certificates, upon the surrender of the
Certificate representing Class A Shares for cancellation to the Paying
Agent,  together with a Letter of Transmittal duly, completely and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, and, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, without any  action by the holders of any Book-Entry Shares,
the Paying Agent shall deliver to such holder of Class A Shares the portion of
the Merger Consideration into which such holder's Class A Shares have been
converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ or _Section 2.03(a)_ , as applicable.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Class A Shares that  is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares may be issued to a transferee if and only if the
Certificate representing such Class A Shares (or, if such Class A Shares are
held in  book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to
the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable share transfer Taxes have
been paid or are not  applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.02(c)_ , subject to _Section 2.03_ ,  each Class A Share, and any
Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender
thereof, the Merger Consideration that the holders of Class A Shares  are
entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ or
_Section 2.03(a)_ ,  as applicable (and the former holders of Class A Shares
shall cease to have any rights as a shareholder with respect to the underlying
shares, except as provided for herein or by any Applicable Law or Order). No
interest shall be paid or shall  accrue on the cash payable with respect to
the Class A Shares pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ , whether upon surrender of
any Certificate or otherwise.

 


 

 

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. Except as provided in _Section 2.02(j)_
, no cash payment with respect to the Merger Consideration shall be paid  to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_.

 


 

 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration paid in respect of each Class A Share in accordance with the
terms of this _ARTICLE             II_ shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Class A
Shares. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and from and after the Effective Time there  shall be no further
registration of transfers on the register of members of the Surviving Company
of Class A Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates (or  evidence
of ownership of Book-Entry Shares) formerly representing Class A Shares are
presented to the Parent Parties or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE II_ , subject to
satisfaction of the terms, conditions and requirements set forth in _Section
2.02(c)_.

 


 

 

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Class A Shares following the first anniversary of the Closing 
Date shall, upon the request of the Parent Parties, be delivered to the Parent
Parties, and any holder of Class A Shares who has not theretofore complied
with this _ARTICLE II_   shall thereafter look only to the Parent Parties for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration.

 


 

 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Company, the Parent Parties or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration (including
any  portion of the Payment Fund in respect thereof) delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of Class A Shares at  such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Parent Parties
or their designee, free and clear of all  claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 


 

 

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall, pending its
disbursement pursuant to this _Section 2.02_ , invest the cash in the Payment
Fund  as directed by the Parent Parties in (i) short-term direct obligations
of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for the payment of  principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper
rated the highest quality by either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's  acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $5,000,000,000. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be payable to the Parent Parties. No investment losses
resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall  diminish the rights of
any shareholder of the Company to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
or any other payment as provided herein, and the Parent Parties shall in any
event be liable for the payment of all such amounts.

 


 

 

 

5  

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parent Parties and the Paying Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, including any amounts 
payable to any former holder of Class A Shares or Company Equity Awards, such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under Applicable Law with respect to Taxes. Any amounts that
are deducted  and withheld from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be timely paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Entity. Amounts so withheld and timely paid over
to the appropriate Governmental  Entity shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

 


 

 

(j) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed  and,
if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable and customary amount as the Parent Parties may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate,  the Parent Parties shall cause the Paying Agent to pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration.

 


 

 

Section 2.03. _Shares of Dissenting Holders_.

 


 

 

(a) At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall  automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist and, unless otherwise required by Applicable
Law, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration without interest pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ , upon the
surrender thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02_. Any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall,  in the event that the fair value of a Dissenting Share as
appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section 106(6) of the Bermuda
Companies Act (the " _Appraised Fair Value_ ")             is
greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration also be entitled to receive
from the Surviving Company an amount in cash equal to the difference between
the Appraised Fair Value and the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of
each  Dissenting Share by payment made within thirty (30) days after such
Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such appraisal
procedure.

 


 

 

(b) In the event that a holder of Dissenting Shares fails  to exercise,
effectively withdraws or otherwise waives any right to appraisal (each, an "
_Appraisal Withdrawal_ "), such holder shall have no other rights in respect
of such  Dissenting Shares, which shall have automatically been canceled and
shall have ceased to exist at the Effective Time, other than the right to
receive solely the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Dissenting
Share as contemplated by _Section 2.01(c)_.

 


 

 

(c) The Company shall give the Parent Parties (i) written  notice of (A) any
demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, Appraisal Withdrawals and any
other written instruments, notices, petitions or other written communication
received by the Company in connection with this _Section 2.03_ and (B) to the
extent that the Company has Knowledge thereof, any applications to the Supreme
Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and
(ii) to the  extent permitted by Applicable Law, the right to participate
with the Company in any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any demands for appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act. The Company
shall not, without the prior  written consent of the Parent Parties,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, offer to settle or settle any
such demands or applications, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal or timely take any other action  to exercise appraisal
rights in accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act. Payment of any amounts
payable to holders of Dissenting Shares shall be the obligation of the Parent
Parties.

tranche, to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, over (B)  the applicable per share exercise price of such
Company Stock Options tranche, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Company
Stock Options of such tranche  immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "

Taxes, if any) equal to (i) the target number of Class A Shares subject to
such Company  Performance Share Awards (which number of Class A Shares
corresponds to not more than the maximum number of Class A Shares set forth in
_Section 3.03(a)(B)_ together with  the number of Class A Shares underlying

(ii) the number of Class A Shares subject to such Company Deferred Share
Awards or Company  Restricted Share Awards.

 


 

 

(d) _Cancellation of Other Company Awards_. In connection with the Merger,
effective at the Effective Time, all rights of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to acquire or receive Class A Shares or benefits measured by the

Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for
issuance under the Company Share Plans or any other Company Benefit Plan, in
each case that are outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time, but
other than the Company Stock Options, the Company Deferred Share Awards and
the Company Restricted Share Awards (collectively, the " _Other  Company

Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Options, Company Deferred Share Awards, Company Restricted Share Awards and
Other Company Awards pursuant to this _Section 2.04_ shall be paid through the
payroll systems of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries promptly
following the Closing Date (but in any event not later than the next regular

Company or its Subsidiaries shall pay such amounts at the earliest time
permitted under the terms of the applicable agreement, plan or arrangement
relating to such payment that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section
409A of the  Code.

 


 

 

(f) _Action by the Company_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt such resolutions
(a copy of which shall be promptly provided to the Parent Parties, and  in
any case no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) and

Time the issued and outstanding Class A Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any bonus issue,
share dividend, subdivision, reclassification, change in capital structure, 
split, combination, consolidation or exchange of Company Shares, exercise of
rights issued pursuant to the Company Rights Plan or any similar event shall
have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon
the number of  Class A Shares will be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Class A Shares and the Parent Parties with the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_
, that with respect to outstanding awards made under the Company Share Plan,
any such adjustments shall be made in  accordance with the Company Share
Plan. Nothing in this _Section 2.05_ shall be construed to permit the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that would  otherwise be
prohibited by this Agreement, including pursuant to _Section 5.01(a)_.

under the laws of Bermuda and has all requisite power and authority 
necessary to own, lease and operate its properties (if any) and assets and to

provide  information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.02(c)_.

 


 

 

 

35  

(d) _Adverse Recommendation Change_. Except as set forth in this _Section
5.02(d)_ , neither the Company, the Company Board nor any committee of the 
Company Board shall (i) (A) change, withhold, withdraw or qualify in any
manner adverse to Parent (or publicly propose to change, withhold, withdraw or
qualify), the Company Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the  Proxy Statement, (C) approve, declare advisable or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, declare advisable or recommend, to
the shareholders of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal, (D) with respect to
the public announcement of any  Acquisition Proposal, fail to confirm
publicly through a press release or similar means the Company Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days after the date when requested to do so in
writing by Parent, (E) if a tender offer or exchange offer  for shares of the
Company that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to
recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
shareholders of the Company on the earlier of (1) the tenth (10th) Business
Day  after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer and (2) the
second (2nd) Business Day prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting or (F)
resolve to take any action described above (any of the foregoing, an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) authorize, adopt or approve, or
publicly propose to authorize, adopt or approve, an Acquisition Proposal, or
cause or permit the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries to enter into any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company
Board may (I) in response to an Intervening Event, effect an  Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law  and (II) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result, in
the case of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, from any breach of
_Section 5.02(a)_ , or, in  the case of the Company or its Subsidiaries'
respective Representatives, result from any material breach of _Section
5.02(a)_ that the Company Board determines in good  faith, after consultation
with a financial advisor of recognized international reputation and outside
legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, (1) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or (2) authorize, adopt and approve such Superior 
Proposal and cause or permit the Company and/or one of its Subsidiaries to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company Board may only take the
actions described in clause _(II)(2)_ if the  Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ concurrently with entering into such
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and pays the Termination Fee in  compliance
with _Section 8.03(b)_ , and may only take the actions described in clause
_(I)_ or _(II)_ if:

 


 

 

(i) the Company has provided prior  written notice to Parent of its or the
Company Board's intention to take such actions at least five (5) Business Days
in advance of taking such action, which notice shall specify (A) in the case
of an Intervening Event, the material circumstances  giving rise thereto and
(B) in the case of a Superior Proposal, the material terms of the Superior
Proposal, including the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal
and, if the Company intends to take the actions described in clause _(II)(2)_
, shall include a copy of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement;

 


 

 

(ii) after providing such notice and  prior to taking such actions, the
Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during
such five (5) Business Day period to make such commercially  reasonable
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would permit the
Company or the Company Board not to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
determine that a proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and

 


 

 

 

36  

(iii) the Company Board shall have  considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement that may be offered in writing by Parent by 5:00 PM Eastern
Time on the fifth (5th) Business Day of such five (5) Business Day period and
shall have determined in good faith (A) with respect to  the actions
described in _Section 5.02(d)(ii)(I)_ , after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that it would continue to be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary  duties under Applicable Law not to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event and (B) with
respect to the actions described in _Section  5.02(d)(ii)(II)_ , after
consultation with a financial advisor of recognized international reputation
and outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal received by the
Company would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal, in  each case, if
such changes offered in writing by Parent were given effect (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of a Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice in accordance with _Section 5.02(d)(i)_
(except that references to five (5) Business Days shall be replaced with three
(3) Business Days) prior to the Company taking any such action).

 


 

 

(e) _Disclosure Obligations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i)
prevent the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) from
issuing a customary "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each
case with respect to an Acquisition Proposal in the form of a tender offer
subject to Section  14(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
of the SEC thereunder, or from making any disclosure to the Company's
shareholders if the Company Board concludes, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that such disclosure is  required under Applicable Law or (ii)
prevent the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this
_Section 5.02_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Adverse Recommendation 
Change may only be made in accordance with _Section 5.02(d)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes the
Company's receipt of an  Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto (without including any reaffirmation) shall not
be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 


 

 

(f) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 


 

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any written or oral inquiry, proposal,
offer or indication of interest from any Person or Group (other than Parent or
its Subsidiaries), whether or not subject to  conditions, providing for (A)
any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions, of (1) 20% or more (based on the fair market
value) of the consolidated assets (including capital stock of  the Company's
Subsidiaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (2)
securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the issued and
outstanding securities of the Company (determined either by the number of
shares or voting  power) or (3) any number of Class B Shares, (B) any tender
offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person or
Group owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the outstanding
securities of the Company (determined either  by the number of shares or
voting power), (C) any merger, amalgamation, consolidation, business
combination, scheme of arrangement, binding share exchange, joint venture,
partnership or similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which 
any Person or Group (or the shareholders or other equity owners of any Person
or Group) would own, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the issued and
outstanding securities of the surviving or resulting entity in a merger or
amalgamation or the  resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company
(determined either by number of shares or voting power) or (D) any combination
of the foregoing, other than, in each case, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

37  

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
from a Person or Group (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) that did
not result, in the case of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, from a
breach of the provisions of this _Section 5.02_ , or, in the case of the
Company or its Subsidiaries' respective Representatives, from a material
breach  of the provisions of this _Section 5.02_ , and that, if consummated,
would result in such Person or Group acquiring, directly or indirectly, 100%
of the then issued and  outstanding Class A Shares or all or substantially
all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and which the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with a financial advisor of recognized  international reputation
and outside legal counsel), (A) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, taking into account the financial, legal and
regulatory aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, including the conditions 
contained therein with respect to the completion thereof, and the identity of
the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal, and (B) if consummated,
would be more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Class
A Shares than  the Merger (after taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed or offered by Parent pursuant to _Section 5.02(d)(iii)_ ).

 


 

 

(g) Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, the  Company and the
Company Board shall continue to comply with their respective obligations under
this _Section 5.02_ and _Section 6.01_ and, unless this Agreement has been
terminated prior to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance
with _ARTICLE VIII_ ,  shall submit this Agreement to the shareholders of the
Company for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change
made in accordance with _Section 5.02(d)_ , the Company shall  not be
required to make the Company Recommendation.

 


 

 

(h) Without limiting the obligations of the Company  pursuant to this
_Section 5.02_ , promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
advise its directors and executive officers as well as the financial
advisors,  outside legal counsel and communication agency engaged by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in writing as to the restrictions set forth in this _Section
5.02_. Any breach or material breach, as provided in this _Section 5.02_ , of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.02_ by any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach or violation
of this Section 5.02 by the Company.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 


 

 

Section 6.01. _Preparation and Mailing of the Proxy Statement_.

 


 

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after (and the  Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to file within fifteen (15) Business Days after the
date of this Agreement) the execution of this Agreement (with the assistance
and cooperation of Parent as reasonably requested by the Company), the 
Company shall prepare and cause a proxy statement relating to the matters to
be submitted to the shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders
Meeting (such proxy statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the
" _Proxy Statement_ ") to be filed with the SEC on a Current Report on Form
8-K. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be disseminated  to its shareholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing. Subject to _Section 5.02_ , the Company Board
shall make the Company Recommendation to the  Company's shareholders and
shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Parent shall furnish
all information concerning Parent and its Affiliates to the Company, as may be
reasonably requested by the Company, to be included in the  Proxy Statement
and, to the extent reasonably requested by the Company, shall otherwise assist
and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any  information
provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto),  the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document, which comments the Company shall consider
in good faith.

 


 

 

 

38  

(b) The Company shall take all necessary actions in  accordance with
Applicable Law, the Company Organizational Documents and the rules of the NYSE
to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders
Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, as soon
as  reasonably practicable after the filing of the Proxy Statement with the
SEC. Subject to _Section 5.02_ , the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the  Company Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may, in its
reasonable discretion, adjourn, recess or postpone the Company Shareholders
Meeting, (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that  any supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement that the Company determines is reasonably
necessary is provided to the shareholders of the Company within a reasonable
amount of time in advance of the Company Shareholders Meeting, (ii) if as of 
the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Proxy Statement), (A) there will be an insufficient
number of shareholders and/or Company Shares represented (either in person or
by proxy) to  constitute the quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Shareholders Meeting or (B) sufficient votes to constitute the Company
Shareholder Approval have not been (or are not reasonably expected to be)
obtained, in the case of clause  _(A_ ) or _(B)_ , in order to solicit such
additional proxies and/or votes such that a quorum would  be present and/or
to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval or (iii) or to the extent required
by Applicable Law or requested by a Governmental Entity, including the SEC or
its staff; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company Shareholders Meeting
shall not be adjourned, recessed or postponed for an aggregate period of more
than ten (10) days without the prior written  consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Company shall provide updates to Parent with respect to the proxy solicitation
for the Company Shareholders Meeting (including interim results) as 
reasonably requested by Parent.

 


 

 

(c) If, prior to the Effective Time (or the earlier  termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms), any event occurs with respect to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which 
would be required to be described in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement in order for the Proxy Statement not to contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or  necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, Parent shall
promptly notify the Company of such event or change, and Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in the prompt  filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by Applicable
Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or
supplement to the Company's shareholders.

 


 

 

 

39  

Section 6.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Cooperation_.

 


 

 

(a) Subject to Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall  cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, during the period prior to the Closing Date (or the
earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms), (i)
afford Parent and Parent's Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable
advance  notice (and in any event not less than twenty-four (24) hours'
notice), and during normal business hours, to all of their respective
properties, books, records, Contracts, officers and employees and (ii) furnish
as promptly as practicable to Parent  such other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as may be reasonably requested by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in each case of clauses _(i)_ and _(ii)_ , 
Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in a manner
so as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and Parent and Parent's Representatives shall not
be permitted  to conduct any invasive environmental assessment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide
such access or furnish such information if the Company reasonably determines
that doing so could reasonably be likely to  (i) violate the terms of any
confidentiality agreement or other Contract with or obligation of
confidentiality owed to a third party, (ii) result in the waiver or loss of
any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (iii) violate any Applicable 
Law or Order or expose the Company to an unreasonable risk of liability for
disclosure of sensitive or personal information. If the Company does not
provide access or information pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
the Company shall,  to the extent possible without violating any agreement or
Applicable Law or Order or risking a loss of attorney-client privilege, inform
Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enable  such information to be furnished or made
available to Parent or its Representatives without so jeopardizing privilege
or protection, incurring liability, or contravening applicable Law or any
Contract or obligation. Notwithstanding anything  contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or
make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.02(a)_ to  the
extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation
where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any
of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are or could reasonably expected to
become adverse  parties. The Company may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, designate any competitively sensitive material to be provided to
Parent under this _Section 6.02 (a)_ as  "Outside Counsel Only Material."
Such materials and information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside counsel of the recipient pursuant to the terms of an agreement with
respect thereto on terms that are reasonably acceptable to the  Company and
pursuant to which such information will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the Company or its legal counsel. All
requests  for information made pursuant to this _Section 6.02(a)_ shall be
directed to such Person(s) as are designated by the Company. All information
made available pursuant to  this _Section 6.02(a)_ , including all
information and/or discussions resulting from any access provided pursuant to
this _Section 6.02(a)_ , shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement,
dated as of September 10, 2018, between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality  Agreement_ "), which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms
set forth therein.

 


 

 

(b) Provided that the Company Shareholders Approval has been obtained, at the
request of Parent, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
cooperate with the Parent Parties and shall use (and shall cause its 
Subsidiaries to use) reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals,
consents, registrations, waivers, Permits (including any Permit transfer,
amendment or reissuance), authorizations, Orders and other confirmations from
any Governmental Entity  or third party with respect to any Permits or
Contracts that are identified by the Parent Parties as having any right in
favor of such Governmental Entity or third party that would be triggered by
the consummation of the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement,
including the Merger. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, from and after such time, the
Parent Parties may request that the Company contact any relevant third
parties  in connection with the foregoing and the Company and the Parent
Parties shall reasonably cooperate with respect to any such communication;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event shall any Parent Party contact any
such third parties without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld,  conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) obtaining any such
approval, consent, registration, waiver, Permit, authorization, Order or other
confirmation, other than the Required Antitrust  Approvals as contemplated by
_Section 7.01(b)_ , shall not be condition precedent to the obligations of the
parties to consummate the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be obligated to pay any fee to obtain any such approval, consent,
registration, waiver, Permit, authorization, Order or confirmation.

 


 

 

 

40  

Section 6.03. _Best Efforts_.

 


 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  each of the
parties hereto shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) cooperate with the
other parties and shall use (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
use) their respective best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken,
all  actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the
other parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the  date hereof and to consummate and make effective,
in the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) preparing and
filing as promptly as reasonably practicable  and fully all documentation to
effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents with any
Governmental Entity, (ii) obtaining (and taking all steps necessary to 
obtain) all approvals, consents, registrations, waivers, Permits (including
any Permit transfer, amendment or reissuance), authorizations, Orders and
other confirmations from any Governmental Entity or third party necessary to
consummate the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) executing
and delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) defending
or contesting in good faith any  Action brought by a third party (including
any Governmental Entity) that could otherwise prevent or impede, interfere
with, hinder or delay in any material respect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 


 

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,  each of the
parties hereto agrees to (i) make all filings and notifications under any
applicable Regulatory Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable and advisable (and, with respect to
each of  the Required Antitrust Approvals, in any event within sixty (60)
Business Days following the date hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed by
Parent and the Company, (ii) supply as promptly as practicable and advisable
any additional information  and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to any applicable Regulatory Law and (iii) use best efforts to take
or cause to be taken all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods  under any applicable
Regulatory Laws and to obtain all consents, authorizations, waivers and
approvals under any Regulatory Laws that may be required by any Governmental
Entity with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to 
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 


 

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,  to the extent
required to obtain each of the Required Antitrust Approvals, each party hereto
shall take or cause to be taken any and all actions necessary to avoid,
eliminate and resolve any and all impediments or objections under any
Regulatory  Law and to obtain all approvals, consents, registrations,
waivers, authorizations, and other confirmations under any Regulatory Law that
may be required by any Governmental Entity in order for the parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable and in any event prior to the End Date, including (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to, and/or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, transfer,  license, disposition,
or hold separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of the
assets, properties or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement as
are required to be divested in order to avoid the entry of any decree, 
judgment, injunction (permanent or preliminary), or any other Order that would
make the transactions contemplated hereby unlawful or would otherwise
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii)  terminating, modifying, or assigning existing relationships,
Contracts, or obligations relating to any assets, properties or businesses to
be acquired pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) changing or modifying any course
of conduct regarding future  operations relating to the assets, properties or
businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement, or (iv) otherwise
effecting any other change or restructuring relating to the assets, properties
or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this  Agreement (all such actions
referenced in clauses _(i)_ through _(iv)_ , " _Divestiture Actions_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take
or agree to  take any Divestiture Action in relation to any of the assets,
properties, businesses, contracts, licenses, product lines, customers or
interests of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the assets,
properties or businesses to be acquired  pursuant to this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

41  

(d) In addition, if any Action is instituted (or  threatened) challenging the
transactions contemplated hereby as violating any Regulatory Law or if any
decree, order, judgment, or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary, or
permanent) is entered, enforced, or attempted to be entered or  enforced by
any Governmental Entity that would make the transactions contemplated hereby
illegal or otherwise delay or prohibit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, each of the parties shall take any and all actions to
contest  and defend any such Action to avoid entry of, or to have vacated,
lifted, reversed, repealed, rescinded, or terminated, any Order (whether
temporary, preliminary, or permanent) that prohibits, prevents, or restricts
consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby.

 


 

 

(e) Parent and its Representatives shall be primarily  responsible for
determining and implementing the process for obtaining all approvals,
consents, registrations, waivers, authorizations and confirmations required
under applicable Regulatory Laws in connection with the transactions
contemplated by  this Agreement, subject to cooperation and prior
consultation with the Company and its Representatives. Each of the parties
hereto shall (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with

connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental
Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) subject to Applicable Laws relating  to the exchange of information,
and to the extent reasonably practicable, provide each other party and its

or submissions in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each
case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby (it being
understood  that certain documents may be subject to reasonable redactions
(A) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, (B) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege concerns, (C) to redact competitively- or
commercially-sensitive material or  (D) as otherwise required by any
Applicable Law or Order), and (iv) to the extent practicable and permitted by
the applicable Governmental Entity or private party, as the case may be, give
the other parties hereto the opportunity to attend and  participate in any
meetings and conferences.

 


 

 

(f) None of the parties shall be required to, and without  Parent's prior
written consent neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, take or

42  

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.03_ or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the right of any party to terminate this Agreement in accordance 
with _ARTICLE VIII_ , so long as such party has until that time complied in
all material respects with its obligations under this _Section 6.03_.

 


 

 

Section 6.04. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 


 

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification,  advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries as
provided  in their respective Organizational Documents (including the
Company's bye-laws) and any indemnification or other similar agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnitee, in each
case as in effect on the date of this  Agreement, shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 


 

 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Parent shall, and  Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each individual who
as of the Closing Date is, or who at any time prior to the Closing Date was, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who  is (or
at any time prior to the Closing Date was) serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person
(including any other Person in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
owns any  equity interests), together with each such individual's heirs,
executors and administrators (each an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the
" _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise), and expenses (including fees and  expenses of legal counsel) in
connection with any Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative, or
investigative), whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in
part, (i) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director or  officer of the
Company or such Subsidiary or other Person or (ii) acts or omissions by an
Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as a director, officer, employee, or
agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or other Person or taken at the
request  of the Company or such Subsidiary or such other Person (including in
connection with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a
director, officer, employee, agent, trustee, or fiduciary of another Person
(including any employee  benefit plan)), in each case under clause _(i)_ or
_(ii)_ , at, or at any time prior to, the  Closing (including any Action
relating in whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest 
extent permitted under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Indemnitee shall be  indemnified against any liability that attaches to such
Indemnitee by virtue of any rule of law as a result of any fraud or dishonesty
of which such Indemnitee is guilty in relation to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as finally judicially  determined by the Supreme Court of
Bermuda. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to
the fullest extent permitted from time to time under Applicable  Law, cause
the memorandum of association and bye-laws of the Surviving Company to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of
expenses and exculpation of each Indemnitee with respect to facts or 
circumstances occurring on or prior to the Closing Date that are no less
favorable to the Indemnitee than the provisions with respect to limitation of
liability, indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and
exculpation contained  in the Company Organizational Documents in effect on
the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended except as
required by Applicable Law or except to make changes permitted by Applicable

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any  of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys  all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case as a condition thereto, Parent or
the Surviving Company (or their respective successors or assigns), as
applicable, shall cause such Person to assume  the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.04_.

 


 

 

(d) For a period of six (6) years commencing immediately  after the Closing,
the Surviving Company shall either (i) cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) 
provide substitute policies for the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date with
respect to individuals who are currently (and any individuals who prior to the
Closing become)  covered by the directors' and officers' and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that in either case of clause _(i)_ and
_(ii)_ , such policies (A) shall provide not less than the existing coverage
provided by and shall otherwise have other terms not less favorable to the
individuals covered thereby than the directors' and officers'  liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Closing Date and (B) shall be with insurance carriers having
at  least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. In lieu of maintaining
or obtaining such insurance policies, prior to the Closing Date, the Company
may (at Parent's  expense) purchase a pre-paid, six-year "tail" directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance
policy for the Company and the individuals who are covered by the directors'
and officers' and fiduciary liability  insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company (and any individuals who prior to the Closing become
covered), such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the
existing coverage and to be on terms and conditions that otherwise  provide
substantially the same benefits to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events  that occurred at or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Company be required to
pay a premium for such insurance in the aggregate in excess of the applicable
amount set forth in _Section 6.04(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the
foregoing insurance can only be obtained at a premium in excess of the
applicable amount set forth in _Section 6.04(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, Parent shall obtain or cause to be obtained directors' and officers'
and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the  applicable
individuals with the most advantageous coverage obtainable for a premium equal
to the applicable amount set forth in _Section 6.04(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure  Letter. The Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to) at all times maintain such policies in full force and
effect in accordance with this _Section  6.04(d)_ , and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

 


 

 

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall guarantee  the prompt
payment of the obligations of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries under
this _Section 6.04_.

 


 

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.04_ , (i) shall survive consummation of
the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives,  and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may
have under the Organizational Documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, by
Contract or otherwise. The  obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company
under this _Section 6.04_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any  Indemnitee to whom this _Section
6.04_ applies, unless (A) such termination or modification is required by
Applicable Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee shall have  consented in
writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that
the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.04_ applies shall be third party 
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.04_ ).

 


 

 

 

44  

Section 6.05. _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with  respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except (a) as may be required by any Applicable Law or Order,
court process or the  rules and regulations of any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system to which the party is subject
or submits or (b) with respect to any press release or public statement that
in the good faith judgment of the  applicable party is consistent with
previous press releases or public statements made in accordance with this
_Section 6.05_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Company
shall be required to consult with the other party in connection with, or
give  the other party the opportunity to review and comment on, any press
release or public statement made in accordance with or matters referred to in
_Section 5.02_ , including  any press release or public statement to be
issued or made in order to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, in the
case of the Company to the extent made pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section 5.02_. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby following
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release in the form 
heretofore agreed to by Parent and the Company. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement (including the first sentence of this _Section
6.05_ ) or as required by  any Applicable Law or Order, no party shall issue
any press release or make any public statement regarding the other party or
the other party's operations, directors, officers or employees without
obtaining the other party's prior written consent.

 


 

 

Section 6.06. _Employee Matters_.

 


 

 

(a) For a period of at least one (1) year following the  Closing Date (or
until such earlier date of the employee's termination of employment with
Parent or its Subsidiaries), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
provide each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than 
those employees whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a
Collective Bargaining Agreement, whose compensation and benefits shall be
provided in accordance with any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement)
who remains in the  employment of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately after the Closing (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with (i)
annual base salary or wages that are no less  favorable than the annual base
salary or wages provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior
to the Closing Date, (ii) incentive compensation, including, as applicable,
equity compensation, and bonus opportunities (excluding any  bonuses and
incentive compensations granted in relation to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) commensurate with those provided to similarly-situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and (iii) other employee benefits
that are  substantially comparable in the aggregate to the other employee
benefits provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company or its
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, except as required by  Applicable Law or any applicable Collective
Bargaining Agreement or as set forth on _Section 6.06(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall  not be required to
provide or continue any defined benefit pension benefits or retiree life or
medical benefits for any Continuing Employee.

 


 

 

(b) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Parent  shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, credit each Continuing Employee for service earned on and
prior to the Closing Date with the Company and its Affiliates, or any of their
respective predecessors, in addition to service earned with Parent  and its
Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date, (i) to the extent that service is
relevant for purposes of eligibility, vesting or the calculation of vacation,
sick days, severance, layoff and/or similar benefits (but not for purposes of
defined  benefit pension benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which the
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date,
and (ii) for such additional  purposes as may be required by Applicable Law,
in each case, if an analogous Company Benefit Plan was in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date, to the extent such service would have
been recognized by the Company or its applicable  Subsidiary under such
analogous Company Benefit Plan as of immediately prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to Continuing Employees.

 


 

 

 

45  

(c) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Parent  shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, waive or cause to be waived any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
that would be applicable to Continuing Employees and their eligible  spouses
and dependents. Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize
for purposes of annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket limits under
their health and/or welfare plans applicable to Continuing Employees, the
dollar  amount of all deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses paid
by Continuing Employees and their respective spouses and dependents under the
Company's or any of its Affiliates' health and/or welfare plans in the
calendar year in which the  Closing occurs.

 


 

 

(d) Without otherwise limiting the generality of _Section 9.07_ , the
provisions of this _Section 6.07_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to
this  Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former
employee of the Company or any of  its Affiliates), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters
provided for in this _Section 6.06_ ) under or by reason of any provision of
this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 6.06_ shall constitute or be  deemed
to constitute the establishment, adoption or amendment of any Company Benefit
Plan or any other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement.

 


 

 

Section 6.07. _Merger Sub; Parent Subsidiaries; Company Subsidiaries_. Parent
shall cause each of Holding, Merger Sub and any other applicable Subsidiary of

Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Company
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply with and perform all of its
obligations  under or relating to this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 6.08. _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent prompt

Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their directors or 
officers by holders of securities of the Company relating to this Agreement,
the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to Applicable Law, Parent and the
Company shall give  the other party the opportunity to participate (at such
other party's sole cost and expense) in the defense or settlement of any
litigation against the other party or its directors or officers by a holder of
securities of the Company relating to  this Agreement, the Statutory Merger
Agreement, the Merger, or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be  unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 


 

 

Section 6.09. _Control of the Other Party 's Business and Operations_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall or is intended to give Parent or the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations  of the other prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, each of
Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision of its
and its Subsidiaries'  respective operations.

 


 

 

 

46  

Section 6.10. _Company Rights Plan; Takeover Statutes_. If (a) any provision
of the Company Rights Plan or the Company Organizational Documents or (b) any
"fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or "interested 
shareholder" statute or other similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to, or restricts or limits in any manner, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Support
Agreement, the Merger or any  of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are within their power and authority and are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the  Statutory Merger Agreement
and the Support Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and thereby. Parent acknowledges that, on the date
hereof in connection with the execution and delivery of this  Agreement, the
Company has entered into an amendment to the Company Rights Plan providing
that the Rights (as defined in the Company Rights Plan) shall expire and shall
cease to be exercisable effective as of immediately prior to, but contingent
on  the subsequent occurrence of, the Effective Time.

 


 

 

Section 6.11. _Peruvian Tax Certification_.

 


 

 

(a) If the Company and Parent determine that the Merger  will constitute an
indirect transfer of shares issued by any direct or indirect Subsidiaries of
the Company that are incorporated in Peru pursuant to Section 10(e) of the
Peruvian Income Tax Law and applicable Peruvian Income Tax Law Regulations, 
upon the request of Parent, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to request that any holder of Class A Shares who would reasonably be
expected to incur any income Tax liability in Peru as a result of such Tax
provisions deliver to  Parent, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, a cost certification from the Peruvian Tax authorities
certifying as to the cost basis in such holder's Class A Shares.

 


 

 

(b) If the Company decides not to take the actions  contemplated by _Section
6.11(a)_ , the Company shall deliver to Parent, at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, an opinion from a recognized Peruvian tax 
adviser or Peruvian legal counsel as to the opinion of such adviser or counsel
that the Merger should not be considered an indirect transfer for purposes of
such Peruvian Tax laws.

 


 

 

Section 6.12. _Notice of Certain Events_. Each of Parent and the Company shall
notify the other in writing after receiving or becoming aware of the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any change or event that would be reasonably 
likely to cause any condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied by the End Date;
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that (a) the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 6.12_ shall not constitute an admission that any condition has
not or will not be satisfied or limit or  otherwise affect the remedies
available under this Agreement to the party receiving such notice and (b) a
failure to comply with this _Section 6.12_ shall not constitute  the failure
of any condition set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ to be satisfied by the End Date.

 


 

 

Section 6.13. _Deregistration and Delisting_. The Company shall cooperate with
the Parent Parties in taking or causing to be taken all actions necessary to
delist the Class A Shares from the NYSE and terminate its registration  under
the Exchange Act, in each case effective as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date.

 


 

 

Section 6.14. _Resignation of Directors and Corporate Officers_. As a material
inducement to the Parent Parties to enter into and perform their obligations
under this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, the Company has 
obtained and delivered to Parent irrevocable written resignations from each of
the directors and corporate officers (excluding the corporate secretary) of
Belmond Holdings, effective as of, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the
Effective  Time. If prior to the Closing Date any additional or substitute
directors or corporate officers of Belmond Holdings are elected or appointed,
the Company shall obtain and promptly provide to Parent irrevocable written
resignations, effective as of  the Closing Date, executed by each such
individual prior to, and as a condition of, such individual's election or
appointment. If for any reason any of the foregoing resignations has not been
received, or is not in full force and effect, at least  twenty (20) days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions required under
Applicable Law and the Organizational Documents of Belmond Holdings to remove
from office, effective as of, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the 
Effective Time the applicable director or corporate officer of Belmond
Holdings. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and
provide to Parent, on or prior to the Closing Date, to the extent requested in
writing by Parent at  least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
resignation letters, effective as of and contingent upon the Effective Time,
from each of the directors and corporate officers of each of the other
Subsidiaries of the Company as requested by  Parent, resigning from such
position as a director and/or corporate officer. The Company shall cooperate
with and assist Parent, at Parent's request, in connection with implementing
changes in the directors of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as  determined
by Parent, effective as of the Closing Date.

(II) a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the
Company Board and shall not have been withdrawn prior to the date of
termination of this Agreement; (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated 
pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ (prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval), _Section  8.01(b)(iii)_ or _Section 8.01(e)_ ; and (C) within
twelve (12) months following the date of termination of this Agreement, the
Company Board recommends that  shareholders vote in favor of, or tender their
shares into, any Acquisition Proposal or the Company enters into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (in
each case, which Acquisition Proposal is ultimately  consummated) or the
Company otherwise consummates the transaction contemplated by any Acquisition
Proposal (in each case, including any Acquisition Proposal made after the date
of such initial Acquisition Proposal or after the termination of this 
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section
8.03(b)(iii)_ , the references to 20% in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50%.

 


 

 

 

51  

Any Termination Fee due under this _Section 8.03(b)_ shall be  paid by wire
transfer of same-day funds (I) in the case of clause _(i)_ above, on the
Business Day immediately following the date of termination of this Agreement,
(II) in  the case of clause _(ii)_ above, on the date and as a condition to
the effectiveness of the termination of this Agreement and (III) in the case
of clause _(iii)_ above, on the date of consummation of the Acquisition
Proposal.

 


 

 

(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements  contained in
_Section 8.03(b)_ are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this  Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amounts due pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit  that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amounts set forth in _Section 8.03(b)_ , the Company shall pay
to Parent its reasonable and documented costs and  expenses (including
attorneys' fees and expenses) actually incurred in connection with such suit
and any appeal relating thereto, together with interest on the amounts set
forth in _Section             8.03(b)_ accrued at the prime rate
as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition on the date such
payment was first required to be  made. In no event shall the Company be
obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Each of the
parties acknowledges and agrees that in light of the difficulty of accurately
determining actual damages with respect to any  termination of this Agreement
resulting in the obligation of the Company to pay the Termination Fee pursuant
to _Section 8.03(b)_ , the right to the Termination Fee  constitutes a
reasonable estimate of the losses or damages that will be suffered by reason
of any such termination of this Agreement and constitutes liquidated damages
(and not a penalty).

 


 

 

(d) The parties agree that the payment of the Termination  Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive monetary remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub under or
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the failure thereof to be consummated) in the event any such payment  becomes
due and payable and, upon payment of the Termination Fee by the Company,
neither Company nor the Company's Affiliates nor its and their respective
current and former directors, officers, employees, members, managers,
partners, shareholders,  agents and representatives (the " _Company Related
Parties_ ") shall have any further liability to Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person for any losses or damages suffered  under, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the termination hereof and the abandonment of the Merger), whether at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. The foregoing is not intended and  shall not
be construed to limit or impair the right of Parent to specific performance or
other equitable relief in accordance with _Section 9.10_.

 


 

 

Section 8.04. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time prior to or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_
,  _however_ , that (a) after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
there shall be made no amendment that by Applicable Law or the rules of the
NYSE requires further  approval by the shareholders of the Company without
the further approval of such shareholders, and (b) except as provided above,
no amendment of this Agreement shall be submitted to be approved by the
shareholders of the Company unless required by  Applicable Law. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by a
duly authorized representative of each of the parties.

 


 

 

 

52  

Section 8.05. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing Date, each
party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the 
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement by another party, (c) waive compliance
with any covenants and agreements of another party contained in this Agreement
or (d) waive  the satisfaction of any of the conditions applicable to such
party contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver by the Company shall
require the approval of the shareholders of the Company unless such approval
is required by Applicable  Law. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under  this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

vice versa, and words of one gender shall be held to include the other gender
as the context  requires; (b) references made to an article, a section, a
schedule or an exhibit, such reference shall be to an article, a section, a

Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the

by the words "without limitation"; (f) the words "hereof", "hereto", "hereby",

Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this  Agreement; (g) the term "or" is not exclusive; (h) the
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a

and thereof. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in  accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to
be performed entirely in that State, without regard to any laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts or choice of law
or  otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that, (i) to the extent any
provisions of this Agreement  relate to the exercise of a director's or
officer's fiduciary duties and/or similarly, statutory duties or obligations
and/or (ii) statutory provisions or other Applicable Laws of Bermuda are
mandatorily applicable to the Merger, such provisions  shall be governed by
and in accordance with the laws of Bermuda.

 


 

 

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this  Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the interpretation and enforcement
hereof shall (except to the extent, and solely to the extent, that any such
Action that relates to the Merger or the Statutory Merger Agreement 
mandatorily must be brought in Bermuda) be heard and determined in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the
State of Delaware, or,  if both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the
federal courts within the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any other state court within the State of Delaware,
and, in each case, any appellate court  therefrom. The parties hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in
any such Actions and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or
lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such Action and  agree not to
assert any Action in any other court or forum. The parties agree that a final
judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by 
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in the
foregoing shall restrict  any party's rights to seek any post-judgment relief

with any such Action in the manner provided  in _Section 9.02_ or in such
other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid and

(c) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE  FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH
RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF, RELATED TO, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
TRANSACTION  CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF A
DISPUTE, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING  WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.08_.

 


 

 

 

64  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 9.08_ are not intended and shall not be
deemed to constitute a submission by the Parent Parties to the jurisdiction of
any United States federal or state court or any other United States 
Governmental Entity, other than and solely for purposes of any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
as provided in this _Section             9.08_ and, if the
Effective Time occurs, any Action initiated (i) by the holders of Class A
Shares to enforce their right to receive the Merger Consideration, (ii) by the
holders of Company Equity Awards to enforce their right to  receive the
consideration payable in accordance with _Section 2.04_ and (iii) by any
Indemnitee to enforce its rights set forth in _Section 6.04_.

 


 

 

Section 9.09. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the
prior  written consent of the other parties hereto. No assignment by any
party shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit  of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this _Section 9.09_ shall  be null and void.

 


 

 

Section 9.10. _Specific Enforcement_. Each party hereto acknowledges and
agrees that irreparable damage would occur in the event of a breach by it of,
or failure to perform under, this Agreement and that monetary damages or any 
other remedy at law, if available, would not be a sufficient remedy therefor.
Therefore, it is agreed that each party shall be entitled to specific
performance and injunctive relief to prevent breaches of and enforce the
provisions of this  Agreement, including the right to specific performance
and injunctive relief to cause the other party to effect the Closing in
accordance with the requirements of _Section 1.02_   of this Agreement, and
each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond or other undertaking in connection with such remedy. Such remedies shall
be cumulative and not exclusive and, subject to _Section 8.03(d)_ , shall be
in addition to any other remedies which any party may have under this
Agreement, whether at law or in equity.

the part of the Parent Parties, the Company or any holder of any share capital
of the Company or Merger Sub:

 


 

 

8.1.1 each Excluded Share shall  automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor nor any
repayment of capital be made in respect thereof;

 


 

 

8.1.2 all Class B Shares issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding as Class B common shares, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company and shall be unaffected by the
Merger; and

 


 

 

8.1.3 subject to _clause 8.1.4_ , each Class A Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) shall
automatically be converted  into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration on the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, and all such Class A Shares
shall no longer be issued and outstanding  and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pertaining to the Class A Shares represented thereby,  without interest, upon
the surrender thereof.

 


 

 

8.1.4 At the Effective Time, each  Dissenting Share shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist and, unless otherwise required by Applicable
Law, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration without interest upon the  surrender thereof. Any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall, in the event that the Appraised Fair Value is
greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, also be entitled to receive
from the Surviving Company an amount in cash equal to the  difference between
the Appraised Fair Value and the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of
each Dissenting Share by payment made within thirty (30) days after such
Appraised Fair Value is finally determined by the Supreme Court of Bermuda 
(the "Court") under Section 106(6) of the Companies Act pursuant to such
appraisal procedure. In the event of an Appraisal Withdrawal with  regards to
a holder of Dissenting Shares, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall be
canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, other than the right to
receive solely the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Dissenting
Share.
