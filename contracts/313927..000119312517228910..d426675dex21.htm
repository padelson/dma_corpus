PURCHASE AND SALE

 

 _Section 2.1_ _Purchase and Sale of the Shares; Conversion of Company
Options._

 

(a) _Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Parent will purchase
from the Company Stockholders, and the Company Stockholders will sell,
transfer, assign and deliver to Parent, all right, title and interest in and
to all of the Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other than restrictions to
which Parent may be subject under applicable securities laws) in exchange for
the Purchase Price. The Purchase Price will be estimated prior to the Closing
Date and will be subject to post-Closing adjustments as provided in _Section
2.3_.

 

(b) _Conversion of Company Options_. At the Closing, each Vested Company
Option (other than a Rollover Option) that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Closing and that has not been exercised prior to the Closing
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
of each such unexercised Vested Company Option outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Closing, by (y) the excess, if any, of (1) the Per Share Common
Payment  _less_ (2) the exercise price per share of such Vested Company
Option (such amount, an " _Option_

 



11   _Payment_ "), and a portion of the other amounts payable (if any) in
respect of Company Equity Securities under this Agreement, in each case as
provided for in this Agreement (including a portion of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount and the Representative Expense Amount). As of the Closing, all Company
Options (whether or not vested) shall no longer be outstanding and shall be
automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of any such Company Option (each, an " _Optionholder_ ") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except as otherwise expressly provided for
herein or by applicable law. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all
actions pursuant to the Option Plan (and the option grant/stock award
agreements in effect with the Optionholders) or otherwise that are necessary
to give effect to the provisions of this _Section 2.1(b)_ with respect
to Company Options as herein provided.

(c) _Rollover Agreements_. As of the date hereof, the Company has entered into
Option Rollover Agreements to be effective as of the Closing with each holder
of Rollover Options providing that the Rollover Options held by each such
holder will be exchanged at the Closing for non-vested Parent Replacement
Options subject to the terms of the applicable Option Rollover Agreement,
that will retain the same aggregate spread value as the Rollover Options they
were exchanged for, and other than with respect to vesting, such Parent
Replacement Options shall have substantially the same terms and conditions as
applied to the Rollover Option immediately prior to the Closing. From and
after the Closing, (i) each Parent Replacement Option may be exercised solely
to purchase shares of Parent Common Shares, (ii) the number of shares of
Parent Common Shares purchasable upon exercise of each Parent Replacement
Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that
were purchasable under such option immediately prior to the Closing multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (iii)
the per share exercise price under each Parent Replacement Option shall be
adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price of such option immediately
prior to the Closing by the Exchange Ratio, and rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of each Rollover Option
shall comply with the requirements of Code Section 409(A) and Treasury
Regulation 1.409(A)- 1(b)(5)(v)(D).

 

 _Section 2.2_ _Closing._ The closing of the Transactions (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the
Parties, which shall be no later than the third (3rd) Business Day following
the satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such
time), unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the Parties;
provided, that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Article 7_ , the Closing shall take place no earlier than the
thirtieth (30th) Business Day following the date of this Agreement. The "
_Closing Date_ " shall be the date on which the Closing is consummated.

_Section 2.3_ _Purchase Price._

(a) _Estimated Purchase Price_. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement executed by an
executive officer of the Company with the Companys good faith estimate of the
Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ "), which sets forth or
includes (i) good faith estimates of (A) the Aggregate Option Exercise Price,
(B) the amount of Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, (C) the amount of Unpaid
Company Stockholder Expenses, (D) the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents, (E)
the Net Working Capital Adjustment and (F) the Section 280G Losses, (ii) a
calculation of the Per Share Estimated Common Payment based on such estimates,
(iii) reasonable supporting documentation for such estimates, and (iv) a flow
of funds setting forth the amounts to be paid pursuant to this _Section
2.3(a)_ (including with respect to each holder of Company Shares and Company
Options) along with wire instructions therefor. The Company shall provide
Parent with such additional support for such estimates set forth in such
statement as Parent may reasonably request. At the Closing, Parent shall pay
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Estimated
Purchase Price as follows:

 



12 (i) $5,000,000 (such amount, the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") shall be
deposited into an escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ "), which
account shall be established pursuant to an escrow agreement (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ "), which Escrow Agreement shall be (x) entered into on
the Closing Date among Parent, the Representative and Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") as security for Company
Stockholders obligations pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)(ii)_, and (y)
substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto;

(ii) $500,000 (such amount, the " _Representative Expense Amount_ ") shall be
deposited into an account established by the Representative for purposes of
satisfying costs, expenses and/or liabilities incurred in its capacity as the
Representative and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement;

 

(iii) with respect to each Company Common Share issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Closing, an amount equal to the Per Share Estimated
Common Payment shall be paid to the holders thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts designated in the flow of funds;
and

 

(iv) with respect to each Vested Company Option (other than the Rollover
Options), an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
of each such unexercised Vested Company Option outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Closing, by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per
Share Estimated Common Payment _less_ (B) the exercise price per share of
such Vested Company Option. With respect to each holder of Company Options who
(i) is currently an employee of a Group Company or (ii) was an employee of a
Group Company at the time such individual became a holder of Company Options,
Parent shall cause the Company to promptly process through the Companys
payroll (not later than the first payroll date following the Closing Date) the
Option Payment,  _less_ any Tax deductions or withholdings required under
applicable Law. In the case of each Optionholder who is not an employee or
former employee of a Group Company, Parent shall promptly pay the Option
Payment to each such Optionholder by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in the amount and to the account designated in the flow of funds, _less_
any Tax deductions or withholdings required under applicable Law.

 

On a date that is mutually agreed to by the Parties, within ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing and prior to the delivery of the statement referred
to in _Section 2.3(a)_, the Company shall proceed with a physical stocktaking
of the inventory of the Group Companies (the " _Inventory Taking_ "),
consistent with the Companys historical procedures for the taking of a full
year-end physical inventory count. Parent may designate a representative to
witness the Inventory Taking at the Group Companies facility located in
Memphis, Tennessee. The Company shall deliver to Parent all
supporting documentation for the receipt of Inventory in transit. At the end
of the physical count, on the same day if practicable and at the latest on the
following day, the Company shall prepare and sign a certificate, stating in
reasonable detail the results of such physical stocktaking, including
quantities of each product or each product family, and reflecting an estimate
of all shipments of finished products to or to be made by, or shipments of any
inventories to be received by, the Group Companies after such physical
stocktaking and prior to the Closing (the " _Inventory Statements_ "). The
quantity and value of the inventory set forth in each of the Inventory
Statements is hereby deemed final for purposes of the inventory included in
the Net Working Capital Adjustment and reflected in the statement referred to
in _Section 2.3(a)_. The value of the inventory items included in the
Inventory Statements will be calculated and determined in accordance with the
Accounting Principles.

 



13 (b) _Determination of Final Purchase Price_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Parent shall prepare (with the assistance of the Companys
current accountants if requested by Parent) and deliver to the Representative
Parents good faith proposed calculation of each of (A) the Aggregate Option
Exercise Price, (B) the Net Working Capital Adjustment, (C) the amount of
Cash and Cash Equivalents, (D) the amount of Closing Date Funded Indebtedness,
(E) the amount of Unpaid Company Stockholder Expenses, (F) the Section 280G
Losses and (G) the Purchase Price (which calculations shall collectively be
referred to herein as the " _Proposed Closing Date Calculations_ "), in each
case, including reasonably detailed calculations of the components thereof and
in a manner consistent with the definitions thereof and determined in
accordance with the Accounting Principles. The calculation of the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations does not permit the introduction of different
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, conventions,
classifications, definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques
or estimation methodologies (including with respect to the calculation of
reserves and accruals), including with respect to the nature of accounts. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (and
components thereof) (i) shall exclude the impact of any decisions made or
actions taken or omitted by Parent or the Group Companies following the
Closing, (ii) shall not reflect changes in assets or liabilities as a result
of purchase accounting adjustments, and (iii) shall be based on facts and
circumstances as they exist on or prior to the Closing. If Parent fails to
timely deliver the Proposed Closing Date Calculations within such ninety (90)
day period, then the Actual Adjustment shall be deemed to equal zero. For the
avoidance of doubt, the calculations to be made pursuant to this _Section
2.3(b)_ and the purchase price adjustment to be made pursuant to  _Section
2.3(b)_ are not intended to be used to adjust for errors or omissions that may
be found with respect to the Company Financial Statements or any
inconsistencies between the Company Financial Statements or the Accounting
Principles, on the one hand, and GAAP, on the other, for which Parents
rights under the RWI Policy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy.

 

(ii) If the Representative does not give written notice of any dispute, which
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the nature and basis of each item
that Representative disputes with respect to the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations (a " _Purchase Price Dispute Notice_ ") to Parent within forty-
five (45) days of receiving the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, Company
Stockholders and the other Parties agree that the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall, with respect to any item not so disputed, be deemed to set
forth the final Aggregate Option Exercise Price, Net Working Capital,
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, Unpaid Company
Stockholder Expenses and Purchase Price, as applicable, in each case, for
purposes of determining the Actual Adjustment. Prior to the end of such forty-
five (45)-day period, the Representative may accept the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations by delivering written notice to that effect to Parent, in which
case the Purchase Price will be finally determined when such notice is given.
If the Representative gives a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Parent within
such forty-five (45)-day period, Parent and the Representative shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the disputed items during the
forty-five (45)-day period commencing on the date Parent receives the
Purchase Price Dispute Notice from the Representative. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 408 shall apply to Parent
and Representative during such 30-day period of negotiations and any
subsequent dispute arising therefrom. If the Representative and Parent do not
agree upon a final resolution with respect to any disputed items within such
forty-five (45)-day period, then either the Representative or Parent may
submit any remaining items in dispute to a nationally-recognized, independent
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Representative or, if
Parent and the Representative fail to agree on such an accounting firm, to
Alvarez and Marsal (in either case, the " _Accounting Firm_ "). Any item not
specifically submitted to the Accounting Firm for evaluation shall be deemed
final and binding on the Parent and Company Stockholders (as set forth in the
Proposed Closing Date Calculations, the Purchase Price Dispute Notice or as
otherwise resolved in writing by Parent and the Representative). The
Accounting Firm shall be

 



14  requested to render a determination of each disputed item within forty-five
(45) days after referral of the matter to such Accounting Firm, which
determination must be in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail,
the basis therefor and must be based solely on (i) the definitions and other
applicable provisions of this Agreement, (ii) a single written presentation
(which presentations shall be limited to the remaining items in dispute set
forth in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations and Purchase Price Dispute
Notice) submitted by each of Parent and the Representative to the Accounting
Firm within fifteen (15) days after the engagement thereof (which the
Accounting Firm shall forward to Parent or the Representative, as applicable)
and (iii) one written response submitted to the Accounting Firm within fifteen
(15) Business Days after receipt of each such presentation (which
the Accounting Firm shall forward to Parent or the Representative, as
applicable), and not on independent review, which such determination shall be
conclusive and binding on each party to this Agreement. The terms of
appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as reasonably
agreed upon between the Representative and Parent, and any associated
engagement fees shall be initially borne 50% by the Representative and 50% by
Parent; _provided_ that such fees shall ultimately be borne by Parent and the
Representative in the same proportion as the aggregate amount of the disputed
items that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as determined by the
Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of the disputed items submitted to
the Accounting Firm. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other
costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving any
dispute hereunder before the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party
incurring such cost and expense. The Accounting Firm shall resolve each
disputed item by choosing a value not in excess of, nor less than, the
greatest or lowest value, respectively, set forth in the presentations (and,
if applicable, the responses) delivered to the Accounting Firm pursuant to
this _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_. The Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be
revised as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto
pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_ and, as so revised, such Proposed
Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final Aggregate
Option Exercise Price, Net Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Closing
Date Funded Indebtedness, Unpaid Company Stockholder Expenses and Purchase
Price, in each case, for all purposes hereunder (including the determination
of the Actual Adjustment).

(iii) Parent shall and shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
to, promptly make its financial records and personnel available to the
Representative and its accountants and other representatives as reasonably
requested by Representative, at reasonable times and upon reasonable prior
notice, during the review by the Representative of, and the resolution of any
objections with respect to, the Proposed Closing Date Calculations.

 

(iv) The Parties agree that the procedures set forth in this _Section
2.3(b)(iv)_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
disputes; _provided_ , that this provision shall not prohibit Parent or the
Representative from instituting litigation to enforce any final determination
of the Purchase Price by the Accounting Firm pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_
in any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction in accordance with
_Section 10.16_. The substance of the Accounting Firms determination shall
not be subject to review or appeal, absent a showing of fraud or manifest
error. It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement to have any final
determination of the Purchase Price by the Accounting Firm proceed in
an expeditious manner; _provided_ ; _however_ , any deadline or time period
contained herein may be extended or modified by the written agreement of
Parent and the Representative and the Parties agree that the failure of the
Accounting Firm to strictly conform to any deadline or time period contained
herein shall not be a basis for seeking to overturn any determination rendered
by the Accounting Firm which otherwise conforms to the terms of this _Section
2.3(b)_. There shall be no ex parte communications between either party and
the Accounting Firm.

 



15 (c) _Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price_.

 

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, (x) Parent shall pay or
cause the Company to pay, to the Company Stockholders and Optionholders (pro
rata based upon such Persons Pro Rata Share) an amount equal to such positive
amount, if any, (1) in the case of the Company Stockholders, by wire transfer
or delivery of immediately available funds, within three (3) Business Days
after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.3_ and (2) in the case of the Optionholders, the Company will
promptly process such amounts through the Companys payroll, _less_ any Tax
deductions or withholdings required under applicable Law and (y)
simultaneously therewith, Parent and the Representative shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent
to release the Adjustment Escrow Amount from the Adjustment Escrow Account to
the Company Stockholders and Optionholders (pro rata based upon such Persons
Pro Rata Share); provided that any amounts payable to the Optionholders will
be released to the Company which in turn will promptly process such amounts
through the Companys payroll, _less_ any Tax deductions or withholdings
required under applicable Law.

 

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within three (3)
Business Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.3_, Parent and the Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to deliver to Parent an amount equal to the absolute value of
such negative amount out of the Adjustment Escrow Amount; _provided_ that if
the absolute value of the Actual Adjustment is less than the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, then simultaneously with the delivery of such joint written
instructions, Parent and the Representative shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release any
excess funds remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account to the Representative;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the absolute value of the Actual Adjustment
is greater than the Adjustment Escrow Amount, then Parent and the
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver the full amount of the Adjustment
Escrow Account to Parent.

_Section 2.4_ _Option Plans_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take the appropriate actions

thereof, other than as set forth herein (including pursuant to _Section 2.3_)
or by applicable Law.

 

 _Section 2.5_ _Payment of Closing Date Funded Indebtedness and Unpaid
Company Stockholder Expenses_. Contemporaneously with the Closing and on
behalf of the Company and Company Stockholders, Parent shall pay in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness that is listed on _Schedule 2.5_ hereto (the " _Repaid
Indebtedness Schedule_ ") and the Unpaid Company Stockholder Expenses that is
set forth in the calculation of Estimated Purchase Price delivered hereunder
and pursuant to wire instructions provided to Parent in connection therewith.
In order to facilitate the repayment of the Closing Date Funded Indebtedness
listed on the Repaid Indebtedness Schedule, no fewer than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver such documents
or instruments and take all such actions as may be required or necessary to,
effective as of the Closing, effect or permit Parent to effect the repayment
of all such Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, including obtaining payoff
letters for all such Closing Date Funded

 



16  Indebtedness that is listed on the Repaid Indebtedness Schedule, which
payoff letters shall acknowledge the aggregate principal amount and all
accrued but unpaid interest constituting such Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness and the names of each Person to which such Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness is owed.

 

 _Section 2.6_ _Withholding_. Parent and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of Company Equity Securities such amount as the
Company is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
provision of applicable state, local or foreign Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Equity Securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made, and the Company shall timely remit such amounts to the appropriate
Governmental Entity. If Parent or the Company would deduct and withhold any
amounts paid to a holder of Company Equity Securities under this Agreement
(excluding for this purpose amounts that are treated as compensation for
income tax purposes), the party proposing the withholding shall take
commercially reasonable efforts to notify the holder of the proposed
withholding before such withholding would otherwise take place in order to
allow such holder a reasonable opportunity to attempt to cure or remedy the
situation, and if the issue causing the withholding requirement to arise has
not been timely cured or remedied by the holder, the Parent or the Company,
as applicable, shall be entitled to withhold. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement
that are treated as employee compensation (including amounts paid to holders
of Company Options) for income tax purposes shall be paid to the Company (at
such time upon which such payment is due), which in turn, shall pay the
applicable recipient such amounts through the Companys payroll, less
applicable withholding Taxes.

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10(b)_ , no Employee Benefit Plan is,
and no Group Company has within the previous six years ever maintained,
sponsored or contributed to, nor does a Group Company have any liability on
account of an ERISA Affiliate with respect to: (i) a Multiemployer Plan, (ii)
any "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA or any other
plan that is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of
ERISA, (iii) any "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 210 of
ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code, or (iv) any "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA, and no Employee Benefit
Plan provides post-termination health, life insurance or other welfare
benefits to current or former employees of any Group Company other than
health continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA or as required by applicable
Law. No Group Company has any liability under Title IV of ERISA, Section 412
or 430 of the Code or under COBRA as a consequence of at any time being
considered a single employer under Section 414 of the Code with any other
Person.

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.10(c)_ , each Employee Benefit Plan
has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms
and complies in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
ERISA, the Code, COBRA, and any other applicable Laws. Each Employee Benefit
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service or
is the subject of a favorable opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service on the form of such Employee Benefit Plan and no events have
occurred and, to the Companys Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances
that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the qualified status of
any such Employee Benefit Plan. All required reports and descriptions of the
Employee Benefit Plans have been timely filed and distributed in all material
respects.

 



24 (d) No Group Company has any material liability under Title IV of ERISA nor,
is any material liability under Title IV of ERISA reasonably expected to be
incurred by any Group Company, including on account of any ERISA Affiliate.
All material contributions required to be made by any Group Company under
applicable Law or the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan, Multiemployer Plan
or the plan of a Governmental Entity, or collective bargaining agreement as of
the Closing Date, have been made in full or properly accrued as of such date.

 

(e) No Group Company nor, to the Companys knowledge, any third party, has
engaged in any "prohibited transactions" (within the meaning of Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan, other than any such transactions that are covered by a statutory or
administrative exemption, and no such non-exempt "prohibited transaction"
with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan is reasonably expected to occur as a
result of any action or inaction by any Group Company or, to the Companys
knowledge, any third party.

 

(f) No Group Company has engaged in any transaction with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan or Multiemployer Plan, that would reasonably
be expected to subject any Group Company to any material Tax or penalty
(civil or otherwise) imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law. Other
than claims and appeals for benefits in the ordinary course, there is no
pending, or to the Companys knowledge, threatened or anticipated action,
suit, grievance, investigation, arbitration, litigation or claim with respect
to any Employee Benefit Plan, Multiemployer Plan, or any assets of any
thereof, and there is no pending audit or investigation of any Employee
Benefit Plan or Multiemployer Plan, by any Governmental Entity, in each case,
that would result in material liability to a Group Company. With respect to
each Employee Benefit Plan that is funded through an insurance policy,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability in
the nature of retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other
similar liability arising wholly or partially out of events occurring on or
before the Closing Date.

(g) The consummation of the Transactions will not give rise to any liability
under any Employee Benefit Plan or Multiemployer Plan for severance pay,
unemployment compensation, termination pay or withdrawal liability, or
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of
compensation or benefits due to any employee, officer, director, stockholder
or other service provider of any Group Company (whether current, former or
retired) or their beneficiaries.

(h) No Group Company nor any of its officers has made any legally binding
promises or commitments, to create any employee benefit plan or agreement, or
modify or change any Employee Benefit Plan (other than non-material
modifications or non-material changes in connection with annual plan
renewals). To the Companys knowledge, no event, condition, or circumstance
exists that could reasonably be expected to result in an increase of the
benefits provided under any Employee Benefit Plan or the expense
of maintaining any Employee Benefit Plan from the level of benefits or
expense incurred for the most recent fiscal year ended before the Closing Date
(other than non-material modifications or non-material changes in connection
with annual plan renewals). To the Companys knowledge, no event, condition,
or circumstance exists that would prevent the amendment or termination of any
Employee Benefit Plan other than in accordance with its terms.

 

(i) With respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that is maintained outside the
jurisdiction of the United States, or covers any employee residing or working
outside the United States: (i) all such plans have been established,
maintained and administered in compliance in all material respects with their
terms and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, orders,
decrees judgments, writs, and regulations of any controlling governmental
authority or instrumentality; (ii) all such plans that are required by
applicable Law or general accounting principles applicable to the relevant
jurisdiction to be funded are funded on the required basis in all material
respects, and with respect to all other such

 



25  plans, reserves sufficient to provide for all obligations accrued through
the Closing Date thereunder have been established on the accounting statements
of the Group Companies; (iii) no material liability or obligation of the
Group Companies exists with respect to such plans; and (iv) for each such plan
that is a defined benefit pension plan, the "projected benefit obligation" of
the plan does not materially exceed the market value of its "plan assets," as
such terms are defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 87 ("
_SFAS 87_ "), as determined in accordance with GAAP and based upon reasonable
actuarial assumptions which would be acceptable for financial reporting
purposes under SFAS 87.

all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the Transactions (including the satisfaction, but
not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in _Article 7_ ). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts, as determined by the Company and/or the
Representative, to obtain consents of all Governmental Entities necessary to
consummate the Transactions. Costs incurred in connection with obtaining such
consents shall be borne by the Parties in accordance with _Section 10.5_
except that all filing fees incurred in connection with the filing and
compliance under the Competition Laws shall be borne by Parent. Each Party
shall make an appropriate filing, if necessary, pursuant to the Competition
Laws with respect to the Transactions promptly (and in any event, within ten
(10) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement and shall supply as
promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the Competition Laws. The Company, Parent and their respective Affiliates
shall not extend any waiting period or comparable period under the Competition
Laws or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to
consummate the Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the
other Parties. Parent agrees to take (and Parents "reasonable best efforts"
shall expressly include the taking of) all actions that are necessary or
advisable or as may be required by any Governmental Entity to expeditiously
(and in no event later than the Termination Date) consummate the Transactions,
including (A) selling, licensing or otherwise disposing of, or holding
separate and agreeing to sell, license or otherwise dispose of, (i) any
entities, assets or facilities of any Group Company after the Closing or (ii)
any entity, facility or assets of Parent or its Affiliates before or after the
Closing, (B) terminating, amending or assigning existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations (other than terminations that would result
in a breach of a contractual obligation to a third party) and (C) amending,
assigning or termination existing licenses or other agreements (other than
terminations that would result in a breach of a license of such other
agreement with a third party) and entering into such new licenses or other
agreement; _provided_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to take any action
pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ that, individually or in the aggregate with
any other actions, would have a material adverse effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(b) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding by
any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced which questions the
validity or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in connection
therewith, the Parties agree to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to
defend against such claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding
and, if an injunction or other order is issued in any such action, suit or
other proceeding, to use reasonable best efforts to have such injunction or
other order lifted.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary and for the avoidance of doubt,
Parent and its external counsel, after good faith consultation with the
Company and its external counsel, and after considering, in good faith, the
views and comments of the Company and its external counsel, shall have the
principal responsibility for devising and implementing the antitrust approval
strategy. 

 



40 _Section 6.5_ _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of the directors and officers of each Group Company or any
other natural person indemnified by any Group Company as of the date of this
Agreement (collectively, " _Indemnified Persons_ "), as provided in such Group
Companys Governing Documents or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof
with respect to any matters occurring prior to the Closing Date, shall survive
the consummation of the Transactions and shall continue in full force and
effect and that Parent shall, and shall cause the Group Companies to, perform
and discharge the Group Companies obligations to provide such indemnity and
exculpation after the Closing. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Group Companies shall advance expenses in connection with such
indemnification as provided in their respective Governing Documents or other
applicable agreements. The indemnification and liability limitation or
exculpation provisions of the Group Companies Governing Documents shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Closing Date in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
as of the Closing Date or at any time prior to the Closing Date, were
Indemnified Persons, unless such modification is required by applicable Law.

(b) Parent shall cause the Company to, and the Company shall, purchase and
maintain in effect beginning on the Closing and for a period of six (6) years
thereafter without any lapses in coverage, a "tail" policy providing
directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the benefit of those
Persons who are covered by any Group Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policies as of the date hereof or at the Closing with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing. Such policy shall provide
coverage that is at least equal to the coverage in effect on the date of this
Agreement under the Group Companies directors and officers liability
insurance policies; _provided_ that the Company may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof so long as such
substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Closing Date, and in no event shall the
Company be required to pay a premium for such "tail" policy in excess of 150%
of the Group Companies current annual premium for liability insurance for the
directors and officers of the Group Companies.

 

(c) The Indemnified Persons entitled to the indemnification, liability
limitation, exculpation and insurance set forth in this  _Section 6.5_ are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.5_.

(d) In the event that Parent, the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Company shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this  _Section 6.5_.

_Section 6.6_ _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company and its Affiliates shall
not take, nor shall it permit any Group Company or their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants or other agents to take, any action to solicit,
encourage, initiate, facilitate or engage in discussions or negotiations with,
or provide any information to or enter into any agreement with any Person
(other than Parent and/or its Affiliates) concerning any purchase of any of
the Companys equity securities or any merger, sale of substantial assets or
similar transaction involving the Group Companies, other than the exercise of
outstanding options and other than the sale or disposition of immaterial
assets in the ordinary course of

 



41  business (each such acquisition transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent hereby acknowledges that prior to the
date of this Agreement, the Company has provided information relating to the
Group Companies and has afforded access to, and engaged in discussions with,
other Persons in connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction and that
such information, access and discussions could reasonably enable another
Person to form a basis for an Acquisition Transaction without any breach by
the Company of this _Section 6.6_. The Company shall promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days after receipt thereof) notify Parent if it
receives any proposal or offer or any inquiry regarding an Acquisition
Transaction which could reasonably be expected to result in such proposal or
offer, the material terms and conditions of such proposal or offer.

_Section 6.7_ _Documents and Information_. After the Closing Date, Parent and
the Group Companies shall, until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, retain all books, records and other documents in connection with audits,
investigations, litigations or other reasonable business purposes pertaining
to the business of the Group Companies prior to or on the Closing Date and
make the same available for inspection and copying by the Representative (at
the Representatives expense) during normal business hours of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon reasonable request and upon
reasonable notice; provided, that if Parent or the Company shall desire to
dispose of any of such books or records prior to the expiration of such
seven (7) year period, Parent shall, prior to such disposition, give the
Representative a reasonable opportunity, at its own expense, to segregate and
remove such books and records as the Representative may select. No such books,
records or documents shall be destroyed after the seventh (7th) anniversary
of the Closing Date by Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without
first advising the Representative in writing and giving the Representative a
reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof.

_Section 6.8_ _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business
Relations_. During the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, Parent hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and shall
not (and shall not permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or
Affiliates to) contact any employee, customer, supplier, distributor or other
material business relation of any Group Company regarding any Group Company,
its business or the Transactions without the prior consent of Richard Bisson
at the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or,
subject to the following sentence, conditioned). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent may request in writing delivered to Richard Bisson to
arrange for meetings with one or more Major Suppliers or Major Customers
identified by Parent and upon receipt of such written notice, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of the other Group Companies to, reasonably
cooperate, assist and arrange meetings, in person or telephonically, between
Parent and any such Major Supplier or Major Customer; provided, however, that
(i) Richard Bisson and representatives of Parent shall agree on an agenda
for any such call, and (ii) Richard Bisson or other representative of the
Company identified by Richard Bisson shall participate in any such meeting
(whether conducted in person, by telephone or otherwise) with such party.

 

 _Section 6.9_ _Employee Benefits Matters_. For at least one (1) year
following the Closing Date, except as would provide in the duplication of any
payments or benefits, Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided to)
employees of each Group Company who continue to be employed by a Group Company
as of and after the Closing with (i) the same salary or hourly wage rate as
provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) the
opportunity to earn annual performance-based bonuses and non-cash employee
benefits (excluding equity and defined benefit pension and
retirement arrangements) that are either (A) substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date or (B) the same as those provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided to) non-U.S. employees of each
Group Company who continue to be employed by a Group Company as of and after
the Closing with at least such compensation and

 



42  benefits as are required by applicable Law. Parent further agrees that, from
and after the Closing Date, Parent shall and shall cause each Group Company to
grant all of its employees credit for any service with such Group Company
earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility and vesting purposes and
(ii) for purposes of vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations
under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement
that may be established or maintained by Parent or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date (the " _New Plans_ "), in each case,
except to the extent such service credit will result in duplication of
benefits or be required under a newly established plan that also applies to
other employees of Parent or any of its Affiliates for which prior service
with the Parent or any of its Affiliates is not taken into account. Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause to be waived all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively at work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee under a corresponding Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date
and (B) cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses
incurred and paid on or before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered
dependent thereof) of any Group Company to be taken into account (subject to
the receipt by Parent of reasonably satisfactory evidence that such expense
was incurred and paid by the employee) for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan that is a welfare plan
with respect to the plan year in which the Closing occurs but only to the
extent such crediting does not result in the duplication of benefits to any
participant. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any current or former employee, director, officer, consultant,
independent contractor or other service provider (including any beneficiary
or dependent thereof) of the Group Companies or any other Person other than
the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted
assigns any third-party beneficiary rights or any right to continued
employment for any period or continued receipt of any specific employee
benefit, or shall constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any
New Plan or Employee Benefit Plan. Prior to the Closing Date, the
sponsoring Company shall adopt resolutions of its board of directors
providing for the termination, effective as of the day immediately prior to
Closing, of all Employee Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code that contain a cash or deferred arrangement as
described in Section 401(k) of the Code (" _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), which
termination may be made contingent on the occurrence of Closing. At least
three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company shall provide
Parent with a draft copy of such proposed resolutions and an opportunity to
make reasonable changes thereto prior to their adoption by the sponsoring
Companys board of directors. Effective immediately following the Closing
Date, Parent shall have in effect a qualified defined contribution plan that
includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") and shall offer
participation in such Parent 401(k) Plan to those employees who were actively
participating in the Company 401(k) Plan immediately prior to its termination.
After the Closing, and pursuant to Section 401(a)(31)(D) of the Code, Parent
shall take all actions necessary to permit the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of eligible amounts
(including outstanding loans) distributed to employees from the Company
401(k) Plan.

_Section 6.10_ _Certain Notifications_.

From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent in writing upon becoming aware of (a) any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company set
forth in _Article 3_ or of any Company Stockholder set forth in _Article 5_ or
(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company or the
Company Stockholders set forth in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
no such notification shall be deemed to cure any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty for purposes of the satisfaction of the
condition to Closing set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_, or
the termination right set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_.

 



43 _Section 6.11_ _RWI Policy_. Parent shall deliver to the Representative
evidence of the purchase by Parent of the RWI Policy, together with evidence
of the payment of the premium for such RWI Policy. Parent will not (and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries not to), without the consent of
the Representative, amend Section X.VIII(B) ( _Subrogation_ ) of the RWI
Policy in a manner that is adverse to the Company Stockholders and
Optionholders.

 

 _Section 6.12_ _Parachute Payments_. With respect to each employee of the
Company who is, or would reasonably be expected to be as of the Closing Date,
a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), prior
to the Closing Date, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) obtain from such individual a waiver of any and all rights to any
payments or other economic benefits contingent on the consummation of the
Transactions (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to
the extent necessary so that such payments and benefits would not constitute
"excess parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G(b) of the Code) with
respect to such individual, and (ii) submit to its stockholders for a vote all
such waived payments in accordance with the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and in a manner that satisfies the applicable
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and any regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _280G Stockholder Vote_ "), such that, if such
vote is adopted by the stockholders in a manner that satisfies the stockholder
approval requirements under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations
promulgated thereunder, no payment received by any such individual would be a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that any contract, agreement, or plan is entered into
by Parent or any of its Affiliates and a disqualified individual
in connection with the Transactions before the Closing Date (the " _Parent
Arrangements_ "), the Parent shall provide a copy of such contract, agreement
or plan to the Company at least seven (7) Business Days before the Closing
Date and shall cooperate with the Company in good faith in order to calculate
or determine the value (for the purposes of Section 280G of the Code) of any
payments or benefits granted or contemplated therein, which may be paid or
granted in connection with the Transactions that could constitute a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code. Within a reasonable period
of time before taking such actions, the Company shall deliver to Parent for
review and comment copies of any documents or agreements necessary to effect
this _Section 6.12_, including, but not limited to, any stockholder consent
form, disclosure statement, or waiver, and the Company shall consider in good
faith all comments received from Parent on such documents or agreements.

_Section 6.13_ _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) For a period of eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, the
Restricted Parties shall not, directly or indirectly, whether by or through
any of its Affiliates or otherwise, (i) hire, engage, retain, solicit, induce,
encourage or attempt to induce any employee of any Group Company to leave the
employ of any Group Company, (ii) hire, engage or retain any former employee
of any Group Company or (iii) in any way interfere with the relationship
between any Group Company and any of its employees. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) general advertising over the internet, in print media or other
mass media not specifically targeting any person shall not be deemed to be a
solicitation or inducement of any such employee in violation of this
Agreement, (B) hiring any such employee who responds to such general
advertising shall not be deemed a violation of this Agreement, and (C) hiring
any Person whose employment with any Group Company has been terminated (other
than termination for "cause" due to such Person engaging in any activity that
would reasonably be expected to harm the Group Company or advantage a
subsequent employer) not less than three months prior to the time of such hire
shall not be deemed a violation of this Agreement.

 

(b) If, at the time of enforcement of the covenants contained in this _Section
6.13_, a court shall hold that the duration or scope restrictions stated
herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree
that the maximum duration or scope under such circumstances shall be
substituted for the stated duration or scope and that the court shall be
allowed and directed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the
maximum period and scope permitted by applicable Law.

 



44 _Section 6.14_ _Consents_. The Company shall use and shall cause each Group
Company to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or initiate the
process to obtain, all consents and approvals set forth on _Schedule 6.14_ ,
provided, however, that no party shall be required to pay any consideration
to any third party from whom consent or approval is requested. For the
avoidance of doubt, the receipt of, or the failure to obtain, any of the
consents and approvals set forth on _Schedule 6.14_ shall not be a condition
to the obligation of any party hereto to consummate the Transactions.

_Section 6.15_ _Affiliate Transactions_. The Company shall ensure that all
contracts set forth on _Schedule 6.15_ shall be fully paid and be discharged
at or prior to the Closing without any further obligations or Liabilities
whatsoever to the Group Companies.

ARTICLE 9

 

REPRESENTATIVE OF COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS

 

 _Section 9.1_ _Authorization of Representative_.

 

(a) MidOcean Partners III, L.P. (or any of its Affiliates as designated by

act as the Representative for the benefit of the Company Stockholders, as the
exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each of the Company
Stockholders, in connection with and to facilitate the consummation of
the Transactions, which shall include the power, authority and discretion:

(i) to enter into amendments to this Agreement and to execute and deliver any
Ancillary Documents (with such modifications or changes therein as to which
the Representative, in its sole discretion, shall have consented) and to agree
to such amendments or modifications thereto as the Representative, in its
sole discretion, determines to be desirable, in each case, whether before or
after the Closing;

Agreement and any Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the Transactions
and the Ancillary Documents as the Representative, in its sole discretion, may
deem necessary or desirable;

 

(iii) to use the Representative Expense Amount to satisfy costs, expenses
and/or liabilities of the Representative in connection with matters related
to this Agreement and/or the Ancillary Documents;

(iv) as the Representative, to enforce and protect the rights and interests
of the Company Stockholders (including the Representative, in its capacity as
a Company Stockholder) and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of
the Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement, and each other agreement, document, instrument or certificate
referred to herein or therein or the Transactions provided for herein or
therein, and to take any and all actions which the Representative believes are
necessary or appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf of the
Company Stockholders, including asserting or pursuing any claim, action,
proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ ") against Parent, consenting to,
compromising or settling any such Claims, conducting negotiations with Parent
and its representatives regarding such Claims, and, in connection therewith,
to: (A) assert any claim or institute any Action; (B) investigate, defend,
contest or litigate any Action initiated by Parent or any other Person, or by
any federal, state or local Governmental Entity against the Representative or
against all Company Stockholders, and receive process on behalf of any or all
Company Stockholders in any such Action and compromise or settle on
such terms as the Representative shall determine to be appropriate, and give
receipts, releases and discharges with respect to, any such Action; (C) file
any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the Representative may deem
advisable or necessary; and (D) file and prosecute appeals from any decision,
judgment or award rendered in any such Action, it being understood that the
Representative shall not (i) have any obligation to take any such actions, and
shall not have any liability for any failure to take any such actions and
(ii) shall not have the authority to investigate, defend, contest or litigate
any Action (or compromise or settlement thereof) made against one or more
Company Stockholders that is not made against all such Persons;

 



49 (v) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Company Stockholders and/or the
Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement, or any other agreement, instrument or document in connection with
the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such failure to act on the
part of the Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Representative
or by such Company Stockholder unless such waiver is in writing signed by the
waiving party or by the Representative;

 

(vi) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Representative, in
its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper
or convenient in connection with or to carry out the Transactions, and all
other agreements, documents or instruments referred to herein or therein or
executed in connection herewith and therewith; and

 

(vii) to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it
shall deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and performing
its function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the
Representative) to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such
Persons.

 

(b) The Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other
compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be
entitled to the payment of all its expenses incurred as the Representative
(provided that Company Stockholders shall be entitled to review a written
statement thereof, together with supporting documentation, upon any reasonable
request therefor). In connection with this Agreement, and any instrument,
agreement or document relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing
to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Representative
hereunder (i) the Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to
any Company Stockholder by reason of any error in judgment or other act or
omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with any such
agreement, instrument or document, excepting only responsibility for any act
or failure to act which represents gross negligence or willful misconduct, and
(ii) the Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel,
public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the matter at
issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the
Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the
Representative to liability to any Company Stockholders. Each of the
Company Stockholders and Optionholders shall indemnify, pro rata based upon
such Persons Pro Rata Share, the Representative against all losses, damages,
liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the amount of any
judgment against them, of any nature whatsoever (including, but not limited
to, any and all expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating,
preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened or any
claims whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with any Action or in
connection with any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of the
Representative hereunder or otherwise in its capacity as the Representative.
The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event of any Action which
finally adjudicates the liability of the Representative hereunder for its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the event of any indemnification
hereunder, upon written notice from the Representative to the Company
Stockholders and Optionholders as to the existence of a deficiency toward the
payment of any such indemnification amount, each of the Company Stockholders
and Optionholders shall promptly deliver to the Representative full payment
of his or her ratable share of the amount of such deficiency, in accordance
with such Persons Pro Rata Share.

 

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or
any termination of this Agreement.

 



50 (d) Parent shall have the right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to
be taken by the Representative pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon the
Company Stockholders. Parent is entitled to deal exclusively with the
Representative on all matters relating to the Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. Any action taken or not taken or decisions, communications or
writings made, given or executed by the Representative, for or on behalf of
any Company Stockholder, shall be deemed an action taken or not taken or
decisions, communications or writings made, given or executed by such Company
Stockholder. Any notice or communication delivered by Parent to the
Representative shall be deemed to have been delivered to all Company
Stockholders.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Parent shall
not be liable for any Loss to any Company Stockholder, for any action taken
or not taken by the Representative or for any act or omission taken or not
taken in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or decisions,
communications or writings made, given or executed by the Representative,
including any failure of the Representative to distribute, or to distribute
or subdivide in the correct amounts, any payments made to the Representative
by Parent for distribution to any Company Stockholder, among the Company
Stockholders or any other Person; it being understood that once Parent has
made such a payment to the Representative for distribution to any Company
Stockholder, among the Company Stockholders or to such other Person, such
payment shall constitute a complete discharge of the relevant payment
obligation of Parent.

(f) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Company Stockholder, and (ii) shall survive the
consummation of the Transactions.

 

(g) The Representative shall collect and receive all moneys and other proceeds
and property payable to Company Stockholders as described in this Agreement,
and, subject to any applicable withholding retention Laws, and net of any out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by the Representative (including any Company
Stockholder Expenses paid by the Representative in excess of the
Representative Expense Amount), the Representative shall promptly disburse to
the holders of Company Equity Securities to the extent of each such Persons
Pro Rata Share at such time as the Representative determines in its reasonable
discretion;  _provided_ , that to the extent any portion of the
Representative Expense Amount is not used on or prior to the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Representative shall deliver any
remaining portion of the Representative Expense Amount to the Company
Stockholders and Optionholders, except that amounts paid to Optionholders may
be made net of any applicable withholding taxes.

 

(h) Upon the written request of any Company Stockholder, the Representative
shall provide such Person with an accounting of all monies received and
distributed by the Representative, in its capacity as the Representative, and
shall provide such Person with such other reasonable information regarding the
Representatives actions, in its capacity as the Representative, as
such Person may reasonably request.

(i) In the event that the Representative becomes unable to perform the
Representatives responsibilities or resigns from such position, the Company
Stockholders holding, prior to the Closing, a majority of the outstanding
capital stock of the Company shall promptly select another representative to
fill such vacancy, who shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, and such
substituted representative shall (i) be deemed to be the Representative for
all purposes of this Agreement and (ii) exercise the rights and powers of, and
be entitled to the indemnity, reimbursement and other benefits of, the
Representative. Such appointment shall be effective upon delivery of at least
two (2) Business Days prior written notice to Parent and, thereafter, the
replacement Representative shall be deemed to be the Representative for all
purposes of this Agreement. Any obligation of Parent to take any action in
respect of the Representative shall be suspended during any period that the
position of Representative is vacant.

 



51 ARTICLE 10

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

 _Section 10.1_ _Survival_. Subject to the limitations and other provisions
of this Agreement, the representations and warranties contained in _Article
5_ shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until
the date that is three (3) years from the Closing Date. No Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to be indemnified or held harmless pursuant to this
_Article 10_ unless such party delivers written notice of its claim for
indemnification to the Indemnifying Party on or prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period set forth above. Any claims for indemnification
asserted in writing prior to the end of the applicable periods set forth above
shall survive until the final resolution thereof.

 

 _Section 10.2_ _Indemnification by the Company Stockholders_. From and after
the Closing, each Company Stockholder, severally and not jointly with any
other Company Stockholder, shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, partners, members,
agents, employees, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Parent
Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Losses incurred or sustained by,
imposed upon, or asserted against the Parent Indemnitees based upon or arising
out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or
warranties made by such Company Stockholder in _Article 5_ of this Agreement.

_Section 10.3_  _Certain Limitations_. The party making a claim under this
_Article 10_ is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ ", and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this _Article 10_ is referred to
as the " _Indemnifying Party_ ".

(a) The indemnification provided for in _Section 10._2 shall be subject to
the following limitations:

(i) The aggregate amount of all Losses under _Section 10.2_ for which an
Indemnifying Party shall be liable shall not exceed the net proceeds received
by such Indemnifying Party. Nothing in this _Section 10.3_ shall be deemed to
limit any rights of the Parent Indemnitees as against any insurer under the
RWI Policy.

 

(ii) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder or of any
claim therefor shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds (other than
under the RWI Policy) or payments from a third party (other than a
Governmental Entity in respect of Taxes), net of direct collection expenses,
received by the Parent on account of such Loss. The Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain full recovery under all insurance policies
and rights against any such third party with respect to any Losses. In the
event that an insurance (other than the RWI Policy) or third party recovery is
received by the Parent with respect to any Losses for which the Parent has
received an indemnification payment from (or on behalf of) a Company
Stockholder hereunder, then a refund equal to the amount of the recovery, less
the reasonable and documented costs and expenses of obtaining such recovery,
shall be made promptly to the Company Stockholder that made or directed and
provided such indemnification payments to the Parent.

 

(iii) The Parent shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate the amount of
Losses for which it is entitled to seek indemnification hereunder. 

 



52 (b) For purposes of this _Article 10_ , any qualification or references to
Material Adverse Effect, materiality, or other similar qualifications
contained in any representation or warranty shall be disregarded for purposes
of determining whether there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty and the amount of any Loss indemnifiable
hereunder.

_Section 10.4_ _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party (i) receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal
proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement
or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the
foregoing (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against such Indemnified Party or (ii)
determines (based on objectively determinable facts and circumstances), with
or without receipt of notice of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, that any
matter has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a
Third Party Claim against such Indemnified Party, in each case, with respect
to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under
this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof (a " _Third-Party Claim Notice_ "). The failure to
give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent such
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The Third-Party Claim
Notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, the basis
for such claim, the amount or estimated amount of Losses (if known or
reasonably capable of estimation), and the method of computation or
estimation of such Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30
days from the date of receipt of the Third-Party Claim Notice, to assume
the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys own cost and
expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, it shall
have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute,
defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim
in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party; provided, that if the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third- Party Claim, then no
compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim may be effected by the
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any breach or wrongdoing,
violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person, and (ii) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by
the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost
and expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with
counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control
the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or
defend such Third-Party Claim or fails to notify the Indemnified Party in
writing of its election to defend within 30 days from the date of receipt of
the Third-Party Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section
10.4(a)_, pay, compromise, defend such Third-Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating
to such Third-Party Claim, but subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article 10. The parties shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects in connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including
making available records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to
the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be
reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if and to
the extent the Indemnifying Party cannot defend any Third-Party Claim on
behalf of the Indemnified Party, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, as a result of a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived or because
there are defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are different from
or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnifying Party shall (i) be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
one external law firm to the Indemnified Party (subject to the limitations
in this _Article 10_ ) and (ii) have no participation rights in the defense
of the Third-Party Claim.

 



53 (b) _Direct Claims_. If an Indemnified Party has determined that any matter
(other than a Third Party Claim) has given or would reasonably be likely to
give rise (based on objectively determinable facts and circumstances) to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement (a "Direct Claim"), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in
reasonable detail, the basis for such claim, the amount or estimated amount of
Losses (if known or reasonably capable of estimation), and the method
of computation or estimation of such Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall
have 30 days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such
Direct Claim. During such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its Representatives to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Indemnified
Partys premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its Representatives
may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within
such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected
such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue
such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and
subject to the limitations and other provisions of this Agreement.

 

 _Section 10.5_ _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

 _Section 10.6_ _Exclusive Remedies_. From and after the Closing, subject to
_Section 11.18_, the parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims for any breach of any
representation or warranty, covenant or agreement by any Company Stockholder
set forth herein shall be pursuant to and limited by the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article 10_. Nothing in this _Section 10.6_
shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to
which any Person shall be entitled pursuant to  _Section 11.18_.

ARTICLE 11

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

 _Section 11.1_ _Non-Survival_. The representations, warranties and covenants
of the Company and Parent contained in this Agreement shall terminate on the
Closing Date; and only the covenants of the Parties that by their terms
survive the Closing Date shall so survive the Closing Date in accordance with
their respective terms (it being acknowledged and agreed that nothing in this
_Section 11.1_ shall limit the rights and remedies contemplated by _Section
11.18_ and _Article 10_ ).

 

 _Section 11.2_ _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
all Exhibits and Schedules hereto, as the same may from time to time be
amended, modified, supplemented, or restated in accordance with the terms
hereof, and together with the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b)
shall not be assigned by any Party (whether by operation of law
or otherwise), other than for collateral purposes, without the prior written
consent of Parent and the Representative. Any attempted assignment of this
Agreement not in accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.2_ shall be
void.

 



54 _Section 11.3_ _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands, consents
and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and
shall be deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person,

delivery confirmation thereof), or by registered or certified mail (postage
prepaid, return receipt requested) to the other Parties as follows:

under applicable Law, but if any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,

sentences and any purported amendment by any party or Parties effected in a
manner which does not comply with this _Section 11.11_ shall be void.

 

 _Section 11.12_ _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the
Company (on behalf of itself) and the Representative (on behalf of the
Company Stockholders) may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of Parent contained herein, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Parent contained herein
or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by Parent pursuant hereto
or (c) waive compliance by Parent with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent may (i) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
Company or the Company Stockholders contained herein, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Company and the
Company Stockholders contained herein or in any document, certificate or
writing delivered by the Company pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance by
the Company or the Company Stockholders with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any Party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party entitled to the benefit thereof. Any
waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a
waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of any
Party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights.

 



58 _Section 11.13_ _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts (including by electronic means), each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one
and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature
page to this Agreement by facsimile or .pdf shall be as effective as delivery
of a manually executed and delivered counterpart to this Agreement.

 

 _Section 11.14_ _Knowledge of the Company_. For all purposes of this
Agreement, the phrase "to the Companys knowledge", "known by the Company"
and any derivations thereof shall mean as of the applicable date, the actual
knowledge after reasonable inquiry of Richard Bisson, Todd Whitbeck, Don
Fairbanks, Todd Boerema, Michael Wakeman, Jay McCulloch, Ken Hair and Anthony
Murphy, none of whom shall have any personal liability or obligations
regarding such knowledge.

 

 _Section 11.15_ _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH
HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY DOCUMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR
RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN RESPECT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY DOCUMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO
OR THERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO
THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND,
ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND
THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY
OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

 _Section 11.16_ _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Each of the Parties (a) submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
(or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court sitting in
Delaware) in any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (b)
agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard and determined
in any such court and (c) agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the Parties waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Action so brought and
waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other
party with respect thereto. Each Party agrees that service of summons
and complaint or any other process that might be served in any Action may be
made on such party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party
to be served at the address of the party and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in  _Section 11.3_. Nothing in this _Section 11.16_,
however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by law. Each Party agrees that a final, non-appealable
judgment in any Action so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 

 _Section 11.17_ _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein and prior to
the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, any and
all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive
of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and
the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the Parties do not perform their respective obligations under
the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as
are required of them hereunder to consummate the Transactions) in accordance
with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is
accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and

 



59  provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or other
security, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the
basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity.

_Section 11.18_  _Non-Recourse_. All claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the other
Ancillary Documents or the Transactions (including any representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or the other Ancillary
Documents or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement or the other
Ancillary Documents), may be made only against (1) Parent, on the one hand,
and (2) the Company and the Company Stockholders prior to the Closing or the
Company Stockholders after the Closing, on the other, but only to the extent
permitted by the terms of this Agreement, including the limitations set forth
in this _Section 11.18_ and _Article 10_. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Parent agrees and acknowledges that its sole recourse to the Company
Stockholders and Optionholders following the Closing shall be limited to (i)
the then remaining balance of the Adjustment Escrow Account to the extent
permitted pursuant to S _ection 2.3(c)_, (ii) the last sentence of this 
_Section 11.18_ and (iii) the claims made pursuant to, but subject to the
limitations and other provisions of, _Article 10_. Except for Parents rights
against the Company Stockholders and Optionholders solely to the
extent expressly provided in the preceding sentence, no other Person,
including the Representative (acting in such capacity), or any of their
respective (or any of the Companys) current directors, officers, employees,
incorporators, members, partners, stockholders, Affiliates (other than Parent
and the Company), agents, attorneys or representatives (all such Persons,
collectively " _Non-Party Affiliates_ ") have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks
to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or affiliates) for
any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or such other Ancillary Document or the Transactions (as the
case may be) or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or such other Ancillary Document (as the case may be) or the
negotiation or execution hereof or thereof; and each Party, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, waives and releases all such liabilities,
claims and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party
Affiliates are expressly intended as third party beneficiaries of this
provision of this Agreement. Neither  _Section 10.6_ nor the first or second
sentences of this _Section 11.18_ shall limit the liability of any Company
Stockholder to Parent in the event of Fraud (x) by such Company Stockholder
with respect to the performance of any covenant or obligation of such Company
Stockholder under the Agreement or the making of any of the representations
and warranties of such Company Stockholder in _Article 5_ of this Agreement
(but only as it itself, himself or herself) (in each case, for the avoidance
of doubt, as qualified by the Schedules) or (y) by the Company with respect to
the performance of any covenant or obligation of the Company under the
Agreement or the making of any of the representations and warranties of the
Company in _Article 3_ of this Agreement (in each case, for the avoidance of
doubt, as qualified by the Schedules), but only if and to the extent such
Company Stockholder had actual (as opposed to imputed or
constructive) knowledge of such Fraud by the Company.

_Section 11.19_ _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP
has acted as legal counsel to the Representative and its Affiliates and the
Group Companies prior to the Closing, and that Kirkland and Ellis LLP intends to
act as legal counsel to the Representative and its Affiliates (which will no
longer include the Group Companies) after the Closing, each of Parent and the
Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to
waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Kirkland and Ellis LLP
representing the Representative and/or its Affiliates (or any of the other
Company Stockholders) after the Closing as such representation may relate to
Parent, any Group

 



60  Company or the Transactions. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences between the Representative, its Affiliates or any
Group Company and Kirkland and Ellis LLP in the course of the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the Transactions shall be deemed to be
attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Representative (and not
the Group Companies). Accordingly, the Group Companies shall not, without the
Representatives consent, have access to any such communications, or to the
files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP relating to its engagement, whether or not the
Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) the Representative (and not the
Group Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege
with respect to such engagement, and none of the Group Companies shall be a
holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP in
respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only the
Representative (and not the Group Companies) shall hold such property rights
and (iii) Kirkland and Ellis LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group
Companies by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Kirkland and
Ellis LLP and any of the Group Companies or otherwise.

_Section 11.20_  _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

 

 _Section 11.21_ _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, each of the
Parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute
and deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and
assurances, and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to the Transactions. 

_Section 11.22_ _Release_.

 

Effective upon the Closing, each Company Stockholder, acting solely in its
capacity as a holder of Company Shares and/or Company Options, on such
Company Stockholders own behalf and, to the greatest extent permitted by
applicable Law, on behalf of each of such Company Stockholders heirs,
successors, assigns, and management companies and general partner entities
that are Affiliates of such Company Stockholder (collectively with such
Company Stockholder, the " _Recipient Releasors_ "), hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waives, releases and forever discharges Parent and its heirs,
successors, assigns, and management companies and general partner entities
that are Affiliates of Parent (collectively with Parent, the " _Company
Releasors_ ") and each of their respective successors, assigns and past,
present and future directors, managers, officers and employees, and each of
their respective heirs, successors and assigns, in each case in their capacity
as such (collectively with the Company Releasors, the " _Company Releasees_ ")
from any and all liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever, in each case
whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown,
arising on or prior to the Closing Date from any claims relating to or arising
out of such Company Stockholders ownership of the Company Shares and/or
Company Options, the termination of such Company Stockholders status as a
holder of Company Shares and/or Company Options and actions taken by the
Companys officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants and
representatives in connection with the negotiation, authorization, approval
and recommendation of the terms of the Transaction. Each Company Stockholder
for itself and the other Recipient Releasors hereby irrevocably covenants to
refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or
commencing, distributing or causing to be commenced, any Action of any kind
against any Company Releasees, based on any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein (including this _Section 11.22_),
nothing in this _Section 11.22_ or any other provision of this Agreement
waives, restricts, prevents or precludes any Company Stockholder from
exercising, any of such Company Stockholders rights (1) to receive and be
paid its portion of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in, this Agreement in respect
of each Company Shares and/or Company Option held by such Company Stockholder
immediately prior to the Closing, or (2) under this Agreement (including
_Section 6.5_) or any Ancillary Document.
