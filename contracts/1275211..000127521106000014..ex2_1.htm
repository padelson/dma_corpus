shall  each promptly notify each other if, at any time before the Closing,

own, operate or lease and to lawfully carry  on  its business as now
conducted and as set forth in Section 3.1(a)  of the  Disclosure Schedule,

Adverse  Effect on Simmons Canada.

       (a)   |  

Each  of SCI and Simmons Canada has all necessary power (in the case of 
SCI) and  corporate power (in the case of Simmons Canada), respectively,
and  authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its 
obligations hereunder and, subject to the receipt of the Trust Unitholder 
Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery  and

consummation by each of SCI and Simmons Canada of the Transactions  have 
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary trust action on  the part 
of SCI and by all necessary corporate action on the part of Simmons  Canada,
and no other trust proceedings on the part of SCI or corporate  proceedings
on the part of Simmons Canada are necessary to authorize  this  Agreement,
or to consummate the Transactions, other than the Trust  Unitholder Approval
and the approval of the Proxy Circular by the  Board  prior to mailing of
the Proxy Circular. This Agreement has been duly  and  validly executed and
delivered by each of SCI and Simmons Canada  and,  assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Simmons  and  Bidco, constitutes a
valid, legal and binding obligation of SCI and  Simmons Canada, enforceable
against SCI and Simmons Canada in accordance  with its respective terms,
except that (i) such enforcement may be  subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium  or other similar Laws, now or
hereafter in effect, affecting creditors'  rights generally, (ii) the remedy
of specific performance and  injunctive and other forms of equitable relief
may be subject to  equitable  defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding  may be brought and (iii) the _Currency  Act_  
(Canada) precludes a court in Canada from rendering judgment in any  currency
other than Canadian  currency.

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (b)   |  

The  Board, upon receiving the recommendation of the Special Committee 
and  after consultation with its financial advisors, has: (i) determined 
that the consideration per Trust Unit to be received by the Trust 
Unitholders upon the redemption of the Trust Units is fair to the  Trust 
Unitholders and in the best interests of SCI; (ii) authorized and  approved
this Agreement and the Transactions; and (iii) resolved to  support and to
recommend that Trust Unitholders vote in favour of  the  Unitholders

       (a)   |  

_Confidentiality_.  The parties acknowledge that SCI, Simmons Canada and
Simmons Company  have  previously executed a Confidentiality and Standstill

       (b)   |

exchange of information and all applicable  antitrust, competition and
similar Laws, and attorney-client and  other  privileges) applicable to SCI

such access. Simmons and Bidco will  hold  any information obtained pursuant

subject to, the provisions  of the Confidentiality Agreement.

otherwise  knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making by any third
party  (other  than Simmons and Bidco) of any proposal or offer with respect

       (b)   |  

Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section 6.2(a),  nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prevent SCI or the Board,  from  (A) complying with
Section 99 of the Securities Act (Ontario)  and similar provisions of the
Securities Laws of each of the other  provinces and territories of Canada (it
being understood that any  such  communication constituting a Change in
Recommendation shall be made  in  compliance with Section 2.2  and the
balance of this Section 6.2(b)) or from calling and holding  a  meeting of
the Trust Unitholders if requisitioned by such Trust  Unitholders; (B)
providing information in response to a request  therefor by a Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written  Acquisition Proposal if the Board
receives from the Person so requesting  such information an executed

pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(iii), entering into an agreement with  respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or any agreement referred to in  clause  (ii)  of
Section 6.2(a)  with respect to an Acquisition Proposal if and only to the
extent  that:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (i)   |  

in  each such case referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D), (1) the Trust 
Unitholder Approval has not yet been obtained, (2) the Board  determines in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel  that failure to
take the foregoing action would be inconsistent with  its  fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, (3) the Board, determines  in good  faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably  likely  to result in, a
Superior Proposal; and 

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

       (ii)   |

Unitholder Approval shall not have been obtained,  (2) such party shall be in
compliance with the provisions of this  Section 6.2,  (3) the Board shall

at least five (5)  Business Days in advance of termination that it is

6.2(c);  and (5) during such five (5) Business Day period, SCI shall have 
negotiated, and shall have made its financial and legal advisors  available 
to negotiate, with Simmons and Bidco should Bidco elect to make such 
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement. As used  herein, 
" **Superior  Proposal** "  means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
to purchase or otherwise  acquire, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the
securities or  all or  substantially all of the assets of SCI or Simmons
Canada and that  the  Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with
financial  advisors  and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all
legal, financial,  regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, is (a) more
favourable,  from a financial point of view, to the Trust Unitholders and 
(b) fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed,  reasonably
likely to receive all Approvals on a timely basis and  otherwise  reasonably
capable of being completed on a timely basis.

       (d)   |  

SCI  and Simmons Canada shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated 
any  existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties 
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. SCI  shall

confidentiality  or standstill or similar agreement to which SCI or Simmons
Canada is a  party.

**_Indemnification._**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

From  and after the Closing, Simmons and Bidco will fulfill, and will cause
Simmons  Canada and/or its successors to fulfill and honor in all respects
its  obligations pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Simmons

**Indemnified  Parties** ")  in effect and any indemnification provisions
under its organizational documents,  in each case as in effect on the date
hereof (and shall also pay expenses in  advance of the final disposition of
any such action, suit or proceeding to  each  Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, upon  receipt from the
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced of the  undertaking to repay
such advances if indemnification is subsequently found  by a  court of
competent jurisdiction, which finding is no longer subject to appeal  or 
further proceedings, that such person is not entitled to indemnification). 
Simmons and Bidco shall cause Simmons Canada and/or its successors to not
amend,  repeal or otherwise modify the provisions with respect to exculpation
and  indemnification contained in its organizational documents as in effect
on the  date hereof for a period of six (6) years from the Closing in any

policy with respect to claims  arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Closing on terms  no  less favorable to those applicable to
the current directors and officers of  Simmons Canada and with an insurance
company having substantially the same  or  better credit quality than
Simmons Canada's current insurance company; provided,  however, that in no
event shall Simmons or Bidco be required to pay aggregate  premiums for
insurance under this Section 6.6 in excess of $150,000. This  Section 6.6 
is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the 
Indemnified Parties referred to herein, their heirs and personal 
representatives. The provisions of this Section 6.6  shall survive the
termination of this Agreement as a result of the occurrence  of  the
Closing.

 

 

       **6.7 **  |  

**_Dissolution  of SCI._**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

The  parties acknowledge that immediately following the Closing and prior to
the  distribution of the Transaction Consideration to the Trust Unitholders,
all  members of the Board and the Trustee intend to resign, Simmons Canada
intends  to  resign as Administrator of SCI and SCI will have no material
assets other than  the Transaction Consideration. Effective as of the Closing
Date, Simmons Canada  shall form a new Subsidiary of Simmons Canada ("Trustee
Sub"), which shall be  appointed immediately prior to the resignation of the
Board and the Trustee,  and  shall agree to act as trustee of SCI. Subject
to Section 6.9, Trustee Sub shall  cause the distribution on the Closing Date
of an amount equal to $16.25 per  Trust Unit to the Trust Unitholders upon
redemption of the Trust Units and  will  thereafter proceed to dissolve SCI.
All costs, expenses and liabilities  associated with such redemption and the
subsequent winding up or dissolution  of  SCI shall be the responsibility of
Simmons Canada and/or Trustee Sub, as the  case may be.

 

 

       **6.8 **  |  

**_Option  Plan._**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

Each  of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the Board, acting on behalf
of  Simmons Canada as Administrator of SCI, shall resolve to permit all
Persons  holding options to acquire Trust Units under the Simmons Canada
Option Plan,  whether currently exercisable or not, to exercise such options
prior to the  Closing Date, including by causing the vesting thereof to be
accelerated.  Simmons Canada shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
all optionholders  to exercise such options prior to Closing. All Trust Units
issued upon the  exercise of such Options shall receive the same
consideration per Trust Unit  as  existing Unitholders.

 

 

       **6.9 **  |  

**_Post-Closing  Income Tax  Consequences._**

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

Simmons  and Bidco hereby agree that they shall take all steps necessary to:

 

 

         |  

(a)

    |  

ensure  that, with respect to a Trust Unitholder whose Trust Units are
redeemed  under the Transactions, the income tax consequences to such Trust 
Unitholder (with respect to such redemption or otherwise) will not  be 
adversely affected by transaction or events involving SCI or Simmons  Canada
that occur subsequent to the completion of the Transactions;  and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(b)

    |  

ensure  that Trustee Sub designates pursuant to subsection 104(21) of the 
ITA, in  respect of each Trust Unitholder, that Trust Unitholder's portion of
SCI's  net taxable capital gains realized in respect of the sale of the 
Common  Shares and the Note to Bidco.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, nothing in this section 6.9 shall prevent
Trustee Sub from  deducting amounts under subsection 104(6) of the ITA in
respect of the  distributions made to the Trust Unitholders on the redemption
of such Trust  Units in respect of income of SCI arising or accruing on or
prior to the  completion of the Transactions.

 

 

       6.10   |  

_Expenses_. 

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

SCI  and Simmons Canada have delivered to Simmons and Bidco a good faith
estimate  of  their transaction expenses as of the Closing and shall deliver
a further good  faith estimate of such expenses to Simmons and Bidco three
(3) Business Days  prior to Closing.

 

 

       **6.11 **  |  

**_Consents_**. 

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

Each  of SCI and Simmons Canada shall use its reasonable commercial efforts,
and  Simmons and Bidco shall cooperate with SCI and Simmons Canada, to obtain
all  necessary Approvals or consents required to be obtained by SCI or
Simmons Canada  from third parties in connection with the Transactions,
including, without  limitation, providing information, including financial
information, regarding  Simmons and Bidco. Simmons and Bidco agree to abide
by the terms of the existing  agreements with such third parties from which
SCI and Simmons Canada are  required to obtain such Approvals or consents and
shall not renegotiate or  otherwise attempt to alter the existing terms of
such agreements prior to the  Closing.

This  Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among
the  parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the 
Disclosure Schedule, (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties 
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior 
representations, agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among 
the  parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and neither party is
relying  on any prior oral or written representations, agreements,

In  the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application

illegal,  void  or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force  and effect and the application of such provision to
other Persons or  circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to
effect the intent of  the  parties hereto. The parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable  provision of this Agreement with a valid

economic, business and other purposes  of  such void or unenforceable

Except  as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly

performed in accordance with  their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that  the parties shall be entitled to
