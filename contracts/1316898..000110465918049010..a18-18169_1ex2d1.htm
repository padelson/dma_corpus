 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

 **THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** dated as of August 1, 2018 (this " _
_Agreement__ "), by and among Focus Brands Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _
_Parent__ "), Jay Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _ _Merger Sub__ "), and Jamba, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement
are defined in _Exhibit A_.

 



 

 _RECITALS_

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved
the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, adopted this Agreement and declared it
advisable for Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, to enter into this
Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent will cause Merger Sub to
commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted
under this Agreement, the " _ _Offer__ ") to purchase all of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _ _Share__ " and, collectively, the
" _ _Shares__ ") at a price per Share equal to $13.00 (such amount, or any
higher amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the " _
_Offer Price__ "), net to the seller in cash, without interest and subject to
any required Tax withholding, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer,
Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _ _Merger__ "),
with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(the " _ _Surviving Corporation__ "), in accordance with Section 251(h) of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _ _DGCL__ "), and each
issued and outstanding Share, other than any Excluded Share, Accepted Share or
Appraisal Share, will thereupon be converted into the right to receive cash in
an amount equal to the Offer Price, without interest and subject to any
required Tax withholding;

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _ _Company Board__ ")
has adopted resolutions (i) determining that this Agreement, including the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) electing that this
Agreement and the Transactions be expressly governed by Section 251(h) of the
DGCL, (iii) adopting and approving this Agreement, declaring the advisability
of this Agreement and approving the Transactions, including the Offer and the
Merger, in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, (iv) approving the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, and (v)
recommending that the holders of Company Common Stock accept the Offer and
tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer (such recommendation, the " _
_Company Board Recommendation__ "), in each case, on the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to
enter into this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have entered into an
agreement with Engaged Capital, LLC and certain

 



      
 

 



 

of its affiliates (" _ _Engaged Capital__ ") pursuant to which, among other
things, Engaged Capital has, subject to the conditions in such agreement,
irrevocably agreed to tender the Shares beneficially owned by such Person in
the Offer (as the same may be amended from time to time pursuant to its terms,
the " _ _Engaged Support Agreement__ ") and an agreement with an affiliate of
Indus Capital Partners, LLC (" _ _Indus__ ") pursuant to which, among other
things, Indus has, subject to the conditions in such agreement, irrevocably
agreed to tender the Shares beneficially owned by such Person in the Offer (as
the same may be amended from time to time pursuant to its terms, the " _
_Indus Support Agreement__ " and, together with the Engaged Support Agreement,
the " _ _Support Agreements__ "); and

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall,
subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be
consummated as soon as practicable following the Offer Acceptance Time.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
the parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 



 

ARTICLE 1 
THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Article 8, as promptly as practicable but
in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to
purchase all of the outstanding Shares at a price per Share equal to the Offer
Price in cash, without interest and subject to any required Tax withholding.

 



 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and
of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer are subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the satisfaction of
the Minimum Tender Condition, the Termination Condition and the satisfaction
or waiver of the other conditions set forth in _Exhibit B_ (the Minimum Tender
Condition, the Termination Condition and the other conditions set forth in
_Exhibit B_ are referred to collectively as the " _ _Offer Conditions__ ").
Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii)
waive any Offer Condition or (iii) make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall (A) reduce the Offer Price, (B) waive, amend or modify
the Minimum Tender Condition or the Termination Condition, (C) impose
conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions or
amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition in a manner adverse to the
holders of the Shares, (D) except as otherwise provided in Section 1.1, extend
or otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

amend or modify the Expiration Time of the Offer, (E) terminate the Offer
other than in accordance with this Agreement, (F) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (G) provide any "subsequent offering
period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or (H) decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer. If,
between the date of this Agreement and the Expiration Time, the outstanding
Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any
stock split, divisions, or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse
stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or
other similar transaction, then the Offer Price shall be appropriately
adjusted.

 



 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The initial expiration time of
the Offer shall be one minute following 11:59 p.m., New York City time on the
date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement of the
Offer, determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under
the Exchange Act, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company (such time or subsequent date and time to which the expiration of the
Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _
_Expiration Time__ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, but subject to the parties respective termination rights
under Article 8, Merger Sub: (x) shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
extend the Offer from time to time: (1) for any period required by any
applicable Law or any interpretation or position of the SEC applicable to the
Offer, (2) for periods of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension until any
waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of
the Offer under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated; and (3) at
the request of the Company, if as of any then scheduled Expiration Time any
Offer Condition (other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the expiration of the Offer and which such conditions are capable
of being satisfied upon the expiration of the Offer) is not satisfied and has
not been waived by Parent or Merger Sub, for periods of up to ten (10)
Business Days per extension to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied and
(y) may extend the Offer from time to time, in its sole discretion (and
without the consent of the Company or any other Person), if, as of any then
scheduled Expiration Time, any Offer Condition (other than any such conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer and
which such conditions are capable of being satisfied upon the expiration of
the Offer) is not satisfied and has not been waived by Parent or Merger Sub,
for periods of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension to permit such Offer
Condition to be satisfied; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall Merger
Sub be required or permitted (without the prior written consent of the
Company) to extend the Offer to a date later than the Outside Date.

 



 

(d) _Termination of the Offer_. Except in connection with a valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, and subject to its obligations to
extend the Offer in accordance with Section 1.1(c), Merger Sub shall not
terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Time without
the prior written consent of the Company. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article 8, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to) promptly (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days of
such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall promptly
return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to
return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the
registered holders thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Acceptance_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and
this Agreement, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
(and Parent shall cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to) (i) immediately after (and, in any event, no later than the
first (1st) Business Day after) the Expiration Time irrevocably accept for
payment all Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to
the Offer (the time of such acceptance, the " _ _Offer Acceptance Time__ ")
and (ii) as promptly as practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time (and in
any event within three (3) Business Days) pay for such Shares.

 



 

(f) _Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger Sub shall:
(i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including
exhibits thereto, the " _ _Schedule TO__ "), which shall contain an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal, summary advertisement, notice of
guaranteed delivery and other ancillary offer documents pursuant to which the
Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein
pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _ _Offer Documents__ ") and (ii) cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and Merger Sub shall
cause the Offer Documents (x) to comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and other applicable Laws and, (y) on the date first filed with
the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to the holders of
Shares, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading, except that no covenant is made by Parent or Merger Sub
with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company in writing
specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents. The Company shall promptly
furnish Parent and Merger Sub with all information concerning the Company and
its stockholders required by the Exchange Act or other applicable Law to be
set forth in the Offer Documents and all other information concerning the
Company and its stockholders as reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub
for inclusion in the Offer Documents and, unless previously validly withdrawn
in accordance with Section 6.1(b), shall allow Parent and Merger Sub to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
provided by it or on its behalf specifically for inclusion in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to
cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents and any
amendments and supplements thereto prior to filing such documents with the SEC
or dissemination of such documents to the holders of Shares. Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel in writing with any comments
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments
(and shall give the Company prompt telephonic notice of any material
discussions with the SEC staff), shall provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the proposed response to any
such comments, and shall provide to the Company

 



      
 

 



 

and its counsel a copy of any written responses thereto and telephonic notice
of any oral responses or discussions with the SEC staff.

 



 

(g) _Funds_. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.9, Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds
necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer
and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable after the expiration of the Offer. Parent and Merger Sub shall,

Sub or by an agent of Merger Sub.

given to the holders of Shares, not to contain any untrue statement of a

become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take
all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable Laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and any
amendments and supplements thereto prior to filing such documents with the SEC
or dissemination of such documents to the holders of Shares. The Company shall
provide Parent and Merger Sub and its counsel in writing with any comments the

the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments (and shall give
Parent prompt telephonic notice of any material discussions with the SEC
staff), shall provide Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the proposed response to any
such comments, and shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel a
copy of any written responses thereto and telephonic notice of any oral

Company Adverse Change Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.1.

 



 

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall instruct its transfer
agent to furnish Merger Sub or its designated agent (x) promptly (and in any
event no later than five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement)
and (y) from time to time thereafter as requested by Parent, with mailing
labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company
Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date and of those persons
becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all
lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all
other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of shares of Company Common Stock as of the most recent
practicable date, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and
assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files) as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the holders of Shares. The date of the list of
stockholders used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and the
Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated is referred to as the " _ _Stockholder
List Date__ ". Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for
such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub
shall, until the consummation of the Offer, hold in confidence the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information
only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement is
terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy all copies

Section 1.3 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, at
the Effective Time, Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the Surviving
Corporation, and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue
unaffected by the Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the properties, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties
of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 1.5 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall
take place as soon as practicable after (but on the same date as) the
consummation (as defined in Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL) of the Offer,
except if the condition set forth in Section 7.1 shall not be satisfied or
waived by such date, in which case on no later than the first Business Day on
which Section 7.1 is satisfied or waived, at the offices of DLA Piper LLP
(US), 2000 University Avenue, East Palo Alto, California 94303, unless another
time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date
upon which the Closing occurs, the " _ _Closing Date__ ").

 



 

Section 1.6 _Consummation of the Merger_. As soon as practicable on the
Closing Date, the parties hereto shall (a) cause the Merger to be consummated
by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate
of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _
_Certificate of Merger__ ") in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL and (b) take all other necessary
or appropriate actions to cause the Merger to be effected under Section 251(h)
of the DGCL without the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company. The Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such later time as Parent and
the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time and
date the Merger becomes effective being the " _ _Effective Time__ " and " _
_Effective Date__ ," respectively).

the DGCL. The Company shall take all necessary action such that the bylaws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except that all references in the bylaws
of Merger Sub to its name, registered office and registered agent shall
instead refer to the name, registered office and registered agent,
respectively, of the Company) until thereafter amended as provided therein and
under the DGCL. The Company shall take all necessary action such that the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
only directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective
Time, each such director to hold office until the earlier of his or her
resignation or removal or his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies.
The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain in office as the officers of the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, each such
officer to hold office until the earlier of his or her resignation or removal.

 



 

ARTICLE 2 
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 



 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock, each
issued and outstanding share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be converted
into and become one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any holder of Shares:

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(c), each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Excluded Shares, Accepted Shares
or Appraisal Shares) shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price without interest thereon
(the " _ _Merger Consideration__ "), subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Laws. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such a
Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Shares in accordance
with Section 2.3, without interest.

 



 

(b) Each Share (i) held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the commencement
of the Offer (the " _ _Excluded Shares__ ") or (ii) irrevocably accepted for
purchase in the Offer (the " _ _Accepted Shares__ "), in either case shall be
canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, divisions, or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall enter
into an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _ _Paying Agent__ "),
which shall provide for the payment of the aggregate Offer Price to the
holders of Shares entitled thereto in accordance with Section 1.1(e) and the
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration to the holders of Shares
entitled thereto in accordance with Section 2.2. Parent shall, or shall take
all steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit
with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time, for

 



      
 

 



 

the benefit of the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, for payment by the Paying Agent in accordance with this
Article 2, the cash necessary to pay for the Shares (the " _ _Payment Fund__
"); _provided_ , that no such deposits shall be necessary in respect of
Excluded Shares or Appraisal Shares. The Payment Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will
cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository
Trust Company (the " _ _DTC__ ") with the objective that (i) if the Closing
occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date,
then the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date
an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to
(A) the number of Shares (excluding the Excluded Shares or Appraisal Shares)
held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _ _DTC
Payment__ "); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m., New York City
time, on the Closing Date, then the Paying Agent will transmit the DTC Payment
to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time but in any event not later than five (5) Business Days
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of a certificate or
certificates representing outstanding Shares (the " _ _Certificates__ ") or of
uncertificated Shares in book-entry form only (" _ _Uncertificated Shares__
"), in each case which Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2 (i) a letter of transmittal,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or the Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, as applicable, to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
(including customary provisions regarding delivery of an "agents message"
with respect to Uncertificated Shares) as Parent may reasonably specify, (ii)
include any other information required pursuant to any applicable Law, and
(iii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder
of record of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share, upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, or receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent in the
case of Uncertificated Shares, in either case together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2, each Certificate or
Uncertificated Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Shares shall
be properly transferred and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of record of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Subject to Section 2.5 and other than with respect to
Excluded Shares, each Certificate and each Uncertificated Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon surrender in accordance with this Section 2.3 the Merger
Consideration into which the Shares

 



      
 

 



 

shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.2. No interest shall be paid
or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares,
_subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and from and after the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares (other than in respect of Excluded
Shares or Accepted Shares) are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, the holder of such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares shall be given a copy of a letter of transmittal and instructed to
comply with the instructions therein in order to receive the Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the Merger. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Law.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any such holders who have not theretofore complied with this
Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for
Merger Consideration.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
shall not have been exchanged in accordance with this Article 2 prior to five
(5) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which any amounts payable pursuant to this Article 2 would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such
amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger
Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to
deduct and withhold) from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Shares (including shares of Restricted Stock),
Options or RSUs such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the applicable Tax Law. The
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub and the Paying Agent shall take all
action that may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are
promptly and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger Sub or the Paying Agent, as applicable, and paid to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Company Options; RSUs; Restricted Stock; ESPP_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of any outstanding Option, whether vested or unvested,
exercisable or unexercisable, each Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior thereto shall, subject to subsection (d) and (f) below,
immediately and fully vest, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
below in this Section 2.4, each such Option shall terminate and be canceled at
the Effective Time and the holder of the Option will be entitled to receive
from the Company, and shall receive as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, in settlement of such Option the Option Cash Amount. The " _
_Option Cash Amount__ " with respect to an Option shall be equal to the net
amount, without interest, of (A) the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per Share otherwise
issuable upon exercise of such Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares
subject to such Option, less (B) any applicable withholdings for Taxes. If the
exercise price per Share of any Option equals or exceeds the Merger
Consideration, the Option Cash Amount therefor shall be zero.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of any outstanding RSU, each RSU that is outstanding
immediately prior thereto shall, subject to subsection (d) and (f) below,
immediately and fully vest, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
below in this Section 2.4, each such RSU shall terminate and be canceled at
the Effective Time and the holder of such RSU will be entitled to receive from
the Company, and shall receive as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, in settlement of such RSU an RSU Cash Amount, without interest. The " _
_RSU Cash Amount__ " with respect to a RSU shall be equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Shares issuable in settlement of the RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time (taking into account any acceleration of vesting),
multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholdings
for Taxes.

 



 

(c) As of immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, each share of
Restricted Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time shall, subject to subsection (f) below, immediately and fully
vest such that the Companys right of reacquisition or repurchase as
applicable, shall lapse in full effective immediately prior to, and contingent
upon, the Offer Acceptance Time. As of the Offer Acceptance Time and without
any further action on the part of the holders thereof, each share of
Restricted Stock shall be treated as

 



      
 

 



 

an outstanding Share for purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of
tendering pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 2.4, each
Company Stock Award granted pursuant to the Companys 2013 Equity Incentive
Plan, as amended and restated May 17, 2016, or a non-plan "inducement award"
granted in reliance on NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5635(c)(4), the vesting of
which is based in whole or in part upon the attainment of one or more
performance goals shall, in lieu of immediate and full vesting pursuant to
subsection (a), (b) or (c), subject to subsection (f) below, become
immediately vested to the extent of the actual attainment of the applicable
performance goal(s) as of the Effective Date determined in accordance with the
terms of the Company Stock Award.

 



 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the later of ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time or the first
payroll date after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay the Option Cash Amount payable with respect to Options and
the RSU Cash Amount payable with respect to RSUs subject to subsection (f)
below; provided that to the extent that any RSU constitutes nonqualified
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the RSU Cash Amount
payable with respect to such RSU shall be paid in accordance with the
applicable RSUs terms and conditions at the earliest time permitted under the
terms of such award that will not result in the application of a Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code. The Option Cash Amounts and RSU Cash
Amounts shall be paid (i) through the Surviving Corporations payroll to the
former holders of Options and RSUs with respect to which the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries have Tax withholding obligations and
(ii) by the Surviving Corporation to the former holders of Options and RSUs
with respect to which the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries have no
Tax withholding obligations.

 



 

(f) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, but in any event within ten
(10) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company shall furnish to each
holder of any outstanding Option, RSU, share of Restricted Stock or other
Company Stock Award that in each case is not fully vested as of the date
hereof (an " _ _Applicable Holder__ "), a Stock Award Cancellation and Release
Letter substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ attached hereto (the " _
_Stock Award Cancellation and Release Letter__ "). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Section 2.4, (i) payment to an Applicable Holder of the
Option Cash Amount and RSU Cash Amount, in respect of the portion of such
Applicable Holders Options and RSUs, respectively, that immediately prior to
the Effective Time was unvested (prior to the acceleration provided for in
Section 2.4(a) or 2.4(b) (an " _ _Unvested Option__ " and " _ _Unvested RSU__
", as applicable), and (ii) the acceleration of vesting (and lapsing of the
Companys right of reacquisition or repurchase, as applicable) of each share
of Restricted Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, shall in each case occur only if, prior to the Closing, such
Applicable Holder shall have delivered to the Company a duly executed Stock
Award Cancellation and Release Letter, otherwise such payment (and such
acceleration of vesting and lapsing of the Companys right of reacquisition or
repurchase) shall be made (or occur) within three (3) Business Days after the
delivery by such Applicable Holder of such items to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation following the Closing, and until such time each applicable
Unvested Option and Unvested RSU and share of Restricted Stock shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the consideration described herein (which, in the case

 



      
 

 



 

of a share of Restricted Stock shall be equal to the Merger Consideration)
subject to the terms hereof. No interest will be paid or will accrue on such
consideration. Following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain (or cause to be maintained) in a segregated account an
amount sufficient to satisfy its obligations in respect of all Unvested
Options and Unvested RSUs and Restricted Stock for which it has not received a
Stock Award Cancellation and Release Letter prior to the Closing, which amount
shall be used by the Surviving Corporation to satisfy its obligations
following the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.4(f).

 



 

(g) The disposition of the ESPP and the rights of participants therein shall
be determined in accordance with Section 6.10(b).

 



 

Section 2.5 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by any Person who (i) is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such Share pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _ _Section 262__ ") and (ii) as of
the Effective Time, has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost such Persons
rights to such appraisal under the DGCL with respect to such Share (all such
Shares, the " _ _Appraisal Shares__ "), shall not be converted into the right
to receive Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.2(a), but rather
shall entitle the holder thereof only to those rights provided by Section 262;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262, then the right of such holder to those rights provided by Section 262
shall cease and such holders Shares shall no longer be deemed to be Appraisal
Shares and shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time
into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.2(a). The Company shall provide Parent
with prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 262 that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the
opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any
such demands.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of either of the Constituent Corporations, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of each Constituent
Corporation or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and
necessary action.

within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has been the subject of a
favorable determination letter (or, if applicable, advisory or opinion letter)

amended within the remedial amendment period to cure any qualification defect
to the extent permitted by Law), and to the knowledge of the Company, no event
has occurred and no condition exists that would reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company Employee

noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The operation of each
Company Employee Benefit Plan will not result in the incurrence of any penalty
to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to the
2010 Health Care Law, to the extent applicable that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

material payment or benefit (including without limitation severance,
unemployment compensation, bonus or otherwise) becoming due or payable to any

and contain all amendments thereto as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board Recommendation or (B) approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve, recommend or
declare advisable, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause
(i) being referred to as a " _ _Company Adverse Change Recommendation__ ");
(ii) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten
(10) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing,

 



      
 

 



 

 _provided that_ , unless a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly
disclosed, Parent may only make such request once every thirty (30) days;
(iii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company to execute or enter into
any Contract with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or
reasonably expected to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail
to consummate, or that would otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be
inconsistent with, the Transactions (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement); or (iv) take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to
make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or
exchange offer by a third party, other than a recommendation against such
offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar
communication) (it being understood that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to a Takeover
Proposal until the close of business on the tenth Business Day after the
commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such Takeover
Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this Section
6.1).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time:

 



 

(i) If the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal (that
did not result from a breach of Section 6.6) from any Person that has not been
withdrawn and after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board
shall have determined, in good faith, that such Takeover Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, (x) the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation, or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(i) to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, if and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
fiduciary obligations of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law; (B) the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice
of its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) at least four (4) Business
Days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation or
termination (a " _ _Determination Notice__ ") (which notice shall not
constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation); (C) (1) the Company shall
have provided to Parent the identity of the Person or group of Persons making
such Takeover Proposal (except to the extent disclosure of such identity would
breach a confidentiality obligation in effect prior to the execution of this
Agreement) and a copy of the Takeover Proposal (which may be redacted if
necessary to remove the identity of the person making such request, proposal
or offer to comply with any confidentiality obligation in effect prior to the
execution of this Agreement) or, if not in writing, a summary of the material
terms and conditions of any Takeover Proposal in accordance with Section
6.6(c), (2) the Company shall have given Parent the opportunity to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that such
Takeover Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, and shall
have negotiated in good faith during such four (4) Business Days after the
Determination Notice with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or
other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, after
consultation with outside legal

 



      
 

 



 

counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such
Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e) would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
fiduciary obligations of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law. Issuance of any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on
behalf of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a
Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 6.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section
6.1(b)(i) shall also apply to any material amendment to any Takeover Proposal
and require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to four (4)
Business Days shall be deemed to be two (2) Business Days.

 



 

(ii) Other than in connection with a Takeover Proposal, the Company Board may
make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a Change in
Circumstance that has occurred and is continuing, if and only if: (A) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law; (B) the Company shall have given
Parent a Determination Notice at least four (4) Business Days prior to making
any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation; and (C) (1) the Company shall
have specified the Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail and the basis
upon which the Company Board proposes to make a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the four (4) Business
Days after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement or make another proposal so that such Change in Circumstance would
no longer necessitate a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, and shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions
or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have
determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change
Recommendation in response to such Change in Circumstance would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Company
Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law. For the avoidance of
doubt, the provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Change in
Circumstance and require a new Determination Notice, except that the
references to four (4) Business Days shall be deemed to be two (2) Business
Days.

 



 

Section 6.2 _Employee and Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all Company Employee
Benefit Plans listed in Section 6.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter or filed
as exhibits to the Available Company SEC Documents and all accrued benefits
vested thereunder; it being understood and agreed that nothing in this Section
6.2(a) shall prevent Parent from amending or terminating any Company Employee
Benefit Plan or other agreement in accordance with its terms and applicable
Law.

 



 

(b) As of the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or one of the Company
Subsidiaries shall continue to employ the employees of the Company and the
Company

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiary as of the Effective Time. For a period of one year following the
Effective Time, Parent agrees to provide, or cause to be provided, to those
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are employed by them
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue to be actively
employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof) during such
one-year period the base salary (or base wages, as the case may be), no less
favorable than the base salary (or base wages, as applicable) provided by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to such employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time; _provided that_ Parent shall be under no obligation to
retain any employee or group of employees of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries other than as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including,
after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), Parent shall, or shall cause
its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such
plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior service with the Company and
its Affiliates of each person who is an employee or former employee of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (a " _
_Company Employee__ ") (to the same extent such service is recognized under
analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or its affiliates
prior to the Closing) as service rendered to Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility to participate
in and vesting thereunder (but not benefit accrual); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or
the funding of such benefit. Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to
use commercially reasonable efforts to, give Company Employees credit for any
deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of the plan year in which the
Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing, they participate in
any other plan for which deductibles or co-payments are required. Parent shall
also use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Employee Benefit Plan
maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its subsidiaries (including,
after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) in which Company Employees
participate, to waive any preexisting condition that was waived under the
terms of any Company Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing or
waiting period limitation which would otherwise be applicable to a Company
Employee on or after the Closing. Parent shall recognize any accrued but
unused vacation, sick leave, and sabbatical time of the Company Employees as
of the Closing Date, in accordance with the terms of such Company policies and
Parent shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to provide such
vacation, sick leave, and sabbatical time in accordance with the terms of such
Company policies but in no event will Parent be obligated to extend or enlarge
the benefits available under such Company policies.

 



 

(d) Parent agrees to provide any required notice under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act, as amended (the " _ _WARN Act__ "), and any
similar federal, state or local Law or regulation, and to otherwise comply
with the WARN Act and any such other similar Law or regulation with respect to
any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group
termination or similar event affecting Company Employees (including as a
result of the consummation of the Transactions) and occurring from and after
the Closing. Parent shall not take any action on or after the Closing Date
that would cause any termination of employment of any employees by Company or
its affiliates that occurs prior to the Closing to constitute a "plant
closing," "mass layoff" or group termination or similar event under the WARN
Act or any similar federal, state, local or foreign Law or regulation, or to
create any

 



      
 

 



 

liability or penalty to Company or its affiliates for any employment
terminations under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) If requested by Parent in writing within thirty (30) Business Days prior
to the Effective Time, effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing Date,
the Company shall adopt such resolutions or amendments to terminate the
Company 401(k) plan. The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the
resolutions or plan amendments (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to review and approval by Parent) evidencing that the Company 401(k)
plan has been terminated.

 



 

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 6.2 are included for the sole benefit of the parties, and that nothing
in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall create any third
party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other person, including any
employees or former employees of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Affiliate of the Company, any Company Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Parent or any of its
Affiliates or to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or
condition of employment with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Affiliates or (ii) shall be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any employee benefit plan.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Antitrust Filings_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as soon as reasonably
practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions,
declarations, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods
from Governmental Authorities (the " _Governmental Consents_ ") and make all
necessary registrations and filings and take all steps as may be necessary to
obtain any such Governmental Consents by or from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority, including in connection with any
Antitrust Law; (ii) obtain all necessary consents, authorizations, approvals
or waivers from third parties; and (iii) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

(b) By way of illustration and not limitation, the parties agree to promptly
take, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to take, all actions and steps
requested or required by any Governmental Authority as a condition to granting
any Governmental Consent, and to cause the prompt expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period and to resolve objections, if any, as the FTC
and the DOJ, or other Governmental Authorities of any other jurisdiction for
which Governmental Consents are sought with respect to the Transactions, so as
to obtain such Governmental Consents, and to avoid the commencement of a
lawsuit by the FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Authorities under Antitrust
Laws, and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or
materially delaying the Offer Acceptance Time or the Closing or delaying the
Offer Acceptance Time

 



       
 

 



 

beyond the Expiration Time, including (x) negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
lease, license, divestiture or disposition of any assets, rights, product
lines, or businesses of Parent and Merger Sub and the Company, and (y)
otherwise taking or committing to take any actions with respect to its or the
Companys businesses, product lines or assets; _provided that_ the parties
shall only be required to take or commit to take any such action, or agree to
any such condition or restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement,
condition or restriction is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in
this _Section 6.3_, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts
to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any
party under Antitrust Laws in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any Judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
could restrain, delay, or prevent the Closing by the Outside Date.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no party shall
be required, nor shall the Company or any the Company Subsidiaries be
permitted, to (x) undertake any efforts, or to take or consent to any action,
if such efforts, action or consent, individually or in the aggregate, would be
reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) take or agree to take any action with
respect to the business or operations of Parent or its Affiliates (other than
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing, subject to the
other limitations herein), or (z) take or commit to take any action with
respect to its business or operations in connection with obtaining the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under, or any
approvals under, the HSR Act or any Governmental Consent, unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the occurrence
of the Closing.

 



 

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable, to):
(i) promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, make an appropriate filing of all Notification and Report forms as
required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions and (ii) cooperate
with each other in determining whether, and promptly preparing and making, any
other filings or notifications are required to be made with, or Governmental
Consents are required to be obtained from, any other Governmental Authorities
in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

(e) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.3,
during the Pre-Closing Period, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding brought by a Governmental Authority or brought by a third party
before any Governmental Authority, in each case, with respect to the
Transactions, (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ
or any other Governmental Authority in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv) upon request,
promptly furnish to the other party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality
agreement to limit disclosure to outside counsel and consultants retained by
such counsel, with copies of documents provided to or received from any
Governmental Authority in connection with any such request, inquiry,

 



      
 

 



 

investigation, action or Legal Proceeding (other than Item "4(c)" and "4(d)"
documents as those terms are used in the rules and regulations under the HSR
Act), (v) subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit
disclosure to counsel and outside consultants retained by such counsel, and to
the extent reasonably practicable, consult in advance and cooperate with the
other parties and consider in good faith the views of the other parties in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and (vi)
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any Law, in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding in respect of the Transactions, each party hereto shall provide
advance notice of and permit authorized Representatives of the other party to
be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in advance in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal to
be made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Each party shall
supply as promptly as practicable such information, documentation, other
material or testimony that may reasonably be requested by any Governmental
Authority, including by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date
with any reasonable request for additional information, documents or other
materials received by any party or any of their respective Subsidiaries from
any Governmental Authority in connection with such applications or filings for
the Transactions. Merger Sub shall pay all filing fees under the HSR Act and
for any filings required under foreign Antitrust Laws, but the Company shall
bear its own costs for the preparation of any such filings. Neither party
shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or
extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, or pull and refile
under the HSR Act, or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the prior
written consent of the other party.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Public Statements_. The initial press release relating to this
Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and
thereafter, subject to Section 5.2, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
consult with each other prior to issuing, and provide each other with the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any public announcement, statement or
other disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions (to the
extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) and
shall not issue any such public announcement or statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange or trading market. Prior to making any written
communications to the employees or independent contractors of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters
that are affected by the Transactions, the Company shall provide Parent with a
copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of
time to review and comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company
shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 6.4 shall not apply to any
communication (a) that is consistent with the initial press release and the
terms of this Agreement and does not contain any information relating to the
Company, Parent or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that has
not been previously announced or made public in accordance with the terms of
this Section 6.4, (b) is made in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and does not primarily relate to this Agreement or the
Transactions or (c) with respect to any Company Adverse Change Recommendation
or announcement made with respect to any Takeover Proposal, Superior Proposal
or related matters

 



      
 

 



 

in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or any dispute between the
parties hereto regarding this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period,
the Company agrees to give prompt notice to Parent of (i) any written notice
received by the Company from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any notice from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, (iii) any
Transaction Litigation commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or involving the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, and (iv) any fact or circumstance that causes or is reasonably
likely to cause the failure of any Offer Condition; _provided_ , that the
failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall not be
considered in determining whether any Offer Condition or condition in _Article
7_ has been satisfied. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of Parent and
Merger Sub agrees to give prompt notice to the Company of (i) any written
notice received by them from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is required in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any notice from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, (iii) any
Transaction Litigation commenced or, to the knowledge of the Parent,
threatened against or involving Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents
Affiliates, or (iv) any fact or circumstance that causes or is reasonably
likely to cause the failure of any Offer Condition; _provided_ , that the
failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall not be
considered in determining whether any Offer Condition or condition in _Article
7_ has been satisfied. In no event shall the delivery of any notice by a party
pursuant to this Section 6.5 limit or otherwise affect the respective rights,
obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.6 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Except as permitted by this Section 6.6, during the Pre-Closing Period,
the Company shall not, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates and its and
their directors and executive officers not to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage the submission of, any Takeover
Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal,
(ii) approve or recommend any Takeover Proposal, enter into any agreement,
agreement-in-principle or letter of intent with respect to or accept any
Takeover Proposal (or resolve to or publicly propose to do any of the
foregoing), or (iii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or
knowingly take any action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to any Takeover Proposal (other than informing third parties of the
existence of the provisions contained in this Section 6.6). The Company shall,
and shall cause its controlled Affiliates and its and their directors and
executive officers to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
other Representatives to (I) cease immediately and cause to be terminated, any
and all existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
third party or its Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with
respect to any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal,
(II) immediately terminate access by any third party to any physical or
electronic data room relating to any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that constitutes or

 



      
 

 



 

would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal and (III) request
that any such third party and its Representatives in possession of non-public
information in respect of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries return or
destroy all such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal
received from a third party after the date of this Agreement (which Takeover
Proposal did not arise out of a breach of Section 6.6) that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its financial advisor
and outside counsel) is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior
Proposal, the Company and its representatives may (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such
Takeover Proposal and its representatives pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; provided that (A) prior to furnishing any such
information, the Company receives from such third party an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) to the extent not previously provided or
made available to Parent, any such non-public information so furnished is
provided or made available to Parent promptly (and in any event no later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after it is so furnished to such third party and (y)
conduct such additional discussions as the Company Board shall determine.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, only in
circumstances in which the Company Board makes a good faith determination,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations of
the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, the
Company shall be permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce, any
standstill provision or similar provision that has the effect of prohibiting
the counterparty thereto from making a Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(b) Nothing contained in this Section 6.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to
the holders of Company Common Stock a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act,
(ii) from making any disclosure to the holders of Company Common Stock that is
required by applicable Law, or (iii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. In
addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a
factually accurate public statement by the Company or the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) that describes the Companys receipt of a Takeover
Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal, the
material terms of such Takeover Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto will not be deemed to be (A) a withholding, withdrawal,
amendment, or modification, or proposal by the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify the Company Board
Recommendation; (B) an adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to
such Takeover Proposal; or (C) a Company Adverse Change Recommendation.
Furthermore, nothing in this Section 6.6 shall prohibit the Company or any of
its Representatives from contacting and engaging in any discussions with any
person or group or their respective Representatives who has made a Takeover
Proposal solely for the purpose of clarifying such Takeover Proposal and the
terms thereof.

 



 

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 6.6, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours of receipt) notify Parent of any request for information with
respect to any Takeover Proposal that is received during the Pre-Closing
Period, or any inquiry with respect to, a Takeover Proposal received during
the Pre-Closing Period and, in connection with such notice, provide to Parent
the

 



      
 

 



 

identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal
(except to the extent disclosure of such identity would breach a
confidentiality obligation in effect prior to the execution of this Agreement)
or request and a copy of the Takeover Proposal or request or, if not in
writing, a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Takeover
Proposal or request. The Company shall (i) keep Parent reasonably informed on
a current basis of the status and material terms of any such Takeover Proposal
or request and any discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms
and conditions thereof and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt) any written indication
of interest (or amendment thereto) or any written material that constitutes an
offer (or amendment thereto), including copies of any proposed Specified
Agreement (which may be redacted if necessary to remove the identity of the
person making such request, proposal or offer to comply with any
confidentiality obligation in effect prior to the execution of this
Agreement); provided, that the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives shall not engage in any substantive discussions or
negotiations or provide any non-public information concerning the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries unless and until such persons identity has
been disclosed to Parent and such redactions have been unredacted.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification by the
Company now existing in favor of each person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an
officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or an employee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or who acts as a fiduciary under any of
the Company Employee Benefit Plans (each an " _ _Indemnified Party__ ") as
provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in each case
as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
agreements in effect on the date hereof, copies of which have been provided to
Parent, including provisions relating to the advancement of expenses incurred
in the defense of any action or suit, shall survive the Merger and shall
remain in full force and effect. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to pay and perform in a timely manner
such indemnification obligations.

 



 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, to the full extent permitted under
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part
out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in respect of this Agreement), and shall
reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or
defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses,
judgments and fines as such expenses are incurred; _provided that_ nothing
herein shall impair any rights to indemnification of any Indemnified Party
referred to in clause (a) above.

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policies, in effect on the date
of this Agreement (the " _ _D andO Insurance__"), for a period of not less than
six years after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions
or omissions prior to the Effective Time; _provided that_ (i) the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts

 



      
 

 



 

containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or officers
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as Companys
current insurance carrier, (ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or
lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, (iii) that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _ _Maximum
Amount__ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto;
_provided, that_ , the Company may prior to the Effective Time substitute for
the existing DandO Insurance a single premium tail coverage with an annual cost
not in excess of the Maximum Amount; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall procure and maintain for such six-year period as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for the Maximum Amount. Parent shall have the right to
cause coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year
"tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the DandO
Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this Section
6.7(c).

 



 

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.7 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this
Section 6.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.7,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.7).

 



 

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.7.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to approve,
for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition and
cancellation or deemed disposition and cancellation of Shares and Company
Stock Awards in the Merger by applicable individuals and to cause such
dispositions or cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the compensation committee of the
Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, shall approve, as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, each
agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Company or any of its
Affiliates and any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company that
are effective as of the date of this Agreement or are entered into after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time pursuant to
which compensation is paid to such officer, director or employee and shall
take all other action reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange
Act.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.10 _Company Stock Awards; ESPP_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, and in any
event prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including obtaining any necessary determinations or resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee thereof) that may be necessary (under the Stock
Plans and award agreements pursuant to which Company Stock Awards are
outstanding or otherwise) to (i) accelerate the vesting and exercisability (as
applicable) of each unexercised Option then outstanding and the vesting and
settlement of each RSU then outstanding so that each such Company Stock Award
shall be vested and exercisable or convertible effective as of immediately
prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time in accordance with Section
2.4(a) and Section 2.4(b), (ii) accelerate the vesting of each share of
Restricted Stock then outstanding so that each such share shall be fully
vested effective as of immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Offer
Acceptance Time in accordance with Section 2.4(c), (iii) terminate each Stock
Plan (except as otherwise agreed by Parent) effective as of and contingent
upon the Effective Time, and (iv) following the vesting acceleration described
in (i) above, cause, as of the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised
Option and each unexpired RSU then outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (and each plan, if any, under which any Company Stock Award may
be granted except, with respect to any such plan, as otherwise agreed by
Parent) to be canceled, terminated and extinguished, subject, if applicable,
to payment pursuant to Section 2.4, in all cases subject to Section 2.4(d) and
2.4(f). The Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time, no holder
(or former holder) of Options, RSUs, Restricted Stock or other Company Stock
Award shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any other equity interest
therein.

 



 

(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary or required under the ESPP
and applicable Law to, contingent on the Effective Time, (i) ensure that no
offering period or purchase period shall be authorized or commenced on or
after the date of this Agreement and (ii) if the Closing shall occur prior to
the end of any offering period in existence under the ESPP on the date of this

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and
the Merger may be abandoned (with respect to Section 8.1(b) through Section
8.1(i), by written notice by the terminating party to the other party) at any
time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Offer (as it may have been
extended pursuant to this Agreement) shall have expired at a time when the
Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied and without the
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however,_
that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(b) if the failure of the Minimum Tender Condition to have

required to be performed by such party at or prior to such Expiration Time;

 



 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if the Offer Acceptance Time shall not
have occurred on or prior to the close of business on the date that is one
hundred twenty (120) days following the date hereof (the " _ _Outside Date__
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under

(d) by either the Company or Parent, if any Judgment issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction or by a Governmental Authority, or Law or other legal
restraint or prohibition making the Offer or Merger illegal or otherwise

seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) shall have
used those efforts required hereunder to resist, lift or resolve such
Judgment, Law or other legal restraint or prohibition;

Board Recommendation as

 



      
 

 



 

required pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(ii) or (iii) shall have effected a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation;

 



 

(f) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)
would give rise to the failure of an Offer Condition set forth in clause (c)
or (d) of _Exhibit B_ and (B) is incapable of being cured by the Outside
Date, or has not been cured by the Company within thirty (30) days after the
date Parent gives the Company notice of such breach or failure to perform;

Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) if either Parent or Merger Sub is
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation hereunder;

 



 

(g) by the Company, if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, and (B) is incapable of being cured by the Outside Date or has not
been cured by Parent within thirty (30) days after the date the Company gives
Parent notice of such breach or failure to perform; _provided, however_ , that
the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(g) if the Company is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation hereunder;

 



 

(h) by the Company, if Merger Sub shall have failed to commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer within the period
specified in Section 1.1(a) or if Merger Sub shall have failed to accept for
purchase all Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to
the Offer when required to do so under Section 1.1(e), in each case if such
failure has not been cured by Parent within three (3) days after the date the
Company gives Parent notice of such failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) if such
failure to commence the offer resulted from the breach of this Agreement by
the Company; or

 



 

(i) by the Company prior to the Offer Acceptance Time in order to accept a
Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 6.6 and enter
into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such Superior
Proposal (a " _ _Specified Agreement__ "); _provided that_ (x) the Company
pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee payable
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) prior to or concurrently with such termination and
(y) concurrently with such termination, the Company enters into a definitive
Specified Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void,
except for the provisions of (i) Section 8.2, (ii) Section 8.3, (iii) Section
5.2(b), (iv) the last sentence of Section 1.2(c), and (v) Article 9, which

pursuant to this Section 8.3, the receipt of the Company Termination Fee shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions

their respective Affiliates against the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and
any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
partners, stockholders, optionholders, managers, members or Affiliates
(collectively, the " _ _Company Released Parties__ ") for any loss suffered as
a result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated or for a

in no event later than two Business Days after termination of this Agreement,
pay Company a fee in immediately available funds of $11,358,527 (the " _
_Parent Termination Fee__ "). The Companys right to receive payment from
Parent of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3 shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company, and its Affiliates against Parent, Merger
Sub and any of their respective

 



      
 

 



 

former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders,
optionholders, managers, members or Affiliates (collectively, the " _ _Parent
Released Parties__ ") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Offer or the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Parent
Released Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these agreements,
the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party fails
to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to
obtain the payment, the other party commences a Legal Proceeding which results
in a Judgment against the breaching party, the breaching party shall pay the
non-breaching party its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be

18. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST IT THAT MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS RELEASE OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS RELEASE.

 



      
 

 



 

19. Nothing in this Release shall confer any rights, remedies or claims upon any person or entity not a party or a permitted assignee of a party to this Release, except for the provisions of _Sections 5 and 7_ (which shall be for the benefit of the Releasees).

21. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Release will be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party because of the authorship of any provision of this Release.

 



 

22. If any term, provision, agreement, covenant or restriction of this Release is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, agreements, covenants and restrictions of this Release shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Release so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

23. This Release may be executed in multiple counterparts (including by means of telecopied and email PDF signature pages), any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

24. This Release shall not be amended, altered, modified, changed or rescinded except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

 



 

25. This Release shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their legal representatives, successors and assigns.
