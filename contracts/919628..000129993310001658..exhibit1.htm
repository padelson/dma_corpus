AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 18, 2010 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is among Columbia Lake Acquisition Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Columbia Lake Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
CKE Restaurants, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").
Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section
8.13.   

WHEREAS, concurrently with entering into this Agreement, the Company (i)
terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 26, 2010,
among Western Acquisition Holdings, Inc. (" _Western Parent_ "), Western
Acquisition Corp. and the Company (the " _Prior Merger Agreement_ ") pursuant
to, and in accordance with, Section 7.1(d)(ii) of the Prior Merger Agreement
and (ii) paid Western Parent the "Go-Shop Termination Fee" (as defined in the
Prior Merger Agreement);   

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving that merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement as a result of which the Company
will become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ ");   

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined
in accordance with Section 5.2 of the Prior Merger Agreement that the Merger
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby constitute a
"Superior Proposal" (as defined in the Prior Merger Agreement); (ii)
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to terminate the Prior Merger
Agreement (in accordance with Section 7.1(d)(ii) of the Prior Merger
Agreement) and enter into this Agreement, (iii) determined that failure to
enter into this Agreement would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; (iv) approved the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger and (v) resolved to
recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company;   

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have approved
this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively to enter into this Agreement;   

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain parties (the " _Guarantors_ ") are entering into a limited
guarantee in favor of the Company (the " _Guarantee_ ") with respect to
certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement; and   

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this
Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Company
Stockholder Voting Agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Company Stockholder Agreement_
"), pursuant to which such stockholders have, among other things, agreed to
vote all of the shares of voting capital stock of the Company that such
stockholders own in favor of the Merger and the adoption of this
Agreement.   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I    

 _The Merger_     

SECTION 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_
").   

SECTION 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time), on a date to be specified by
Parent and the Company (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than
the third business day after satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), at
the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, 101 Park Avenue, New York, New
York 10178, unless another date, time, or place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, if the Marketing
Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at such time), neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required
to effect the Closing until the earlier of (a) a date during the Marketing
Period specified by Parent on no less than three business days written
notice to the Company and (b) the final day of the Marketing Period.   

SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, executed
in accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") and shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time
as is agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of
Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to
as the " _Effective Time_ ").   

SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   

SECTION 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of
(except with respect to the name of the Company) the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub, and as amended shall be the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to
Section 5.9 hereof).   

SECTION 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.   

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.   

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.   

ARTICLE II    

 _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations;
Exchange of_ 
  _Certificates; Company Stock Options_     

SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ ") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:   

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. Any shares of Company Common Stock owned by
any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall not
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall, at the
election of Parent, either: (i) convert into shares of a class of stock of
the Surviving Corporation designated by Parent in connection with the Merger,
or (ii) be canceled.   

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to $12.55, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate, which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_
") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2(b), without
interest.   

SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.   

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company, which must be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to
act as agent for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection
with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive, on terms reasonably
acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of shares of
Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Parent
shall deposit or cause to be deposited such aggregate Merger Consideration
with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time. Such aggregate
Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending
its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of
America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings
Services, respectively, (iv) in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or (v) money market funds having a rating in the
highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at
the time of such investment. To the extent that there are any losses with
respect to any such investments, or the aggregate Merger Consideration
deposited with the Paying Agent diminishes for any reason below the
level required for the Paying Agent to make cash payment under Section
2.1(c), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly
replace or restore the cash on deposit with the Paying Agent so as to ensure
that the Paying Agent at all times has cash on deposit maintained at a
level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such aggregate payments under
Section 2.1(c).   

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in
such form and shall have such other customary provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall immediately be canceled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate surrendered and shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Article II, without interest.   

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of
this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any time
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.   

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article II.   

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held
by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any
interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.   

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.   

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld,
the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.   

SECTION 2.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder
who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be converted
into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be entitled to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If
any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holders shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into
and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time,
the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in
accordance with Section 2.1, without any interest thereon. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice and a copy of any written demands for appraisal
of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not make any
payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument unless Parent shall have given its written
consent to such payment or settlement.   

SECTION 2.4 _Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock_.   

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof
and amending any Company Stock Plan) to:   

(i) terminate each Company Stock Plan,   

(ii) provide that each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (each, an " _Option_ ") that is
outstanding and unexercised (without regard to the exercise price of such
Option) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to and
contingent on the Closing,   

(iii) cancel, as of the Effective Time, each Option that is outstanding and
unexercised (without regard to the exercise price of such Option), as of the
Effective Time (in each case, without the creation of additional liability to
the Company or any Subsidiaries), subject, if applicable, to the payment
pursuant to this Section 2.4, and   

(iv) provide that each restricted share of Company Common Stock, granted under
the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become fully vested immediately prior to and contingent
on the Closing, and provide that each such share shall be treated as a share
of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement.   

(b) Each holder of an Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the
Effective Time and has an exercise price per share that is less than the per
share Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three
days after the Effective Time) a cash amount equal to the Designated
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the
Option (subject to applicable tax withholding). For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Designated Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of
Company Common Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal
to the excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration per share of Company
Common Stock over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of such share of
Company Common Stock issuable under such Option.   

(c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of an Option a letter
describing the treatment of and, if applicable, payment for such Option
pursuant to this Section 2.4 and providing instructions for use in obtaining
payment for such Option. Parent shall maintain, or shall cause to be
maintained, at all times from and after the Effective Time sufficient liquid
funds to pay the Designated Consideration and to satisfy its obligations to
holders of Options pursuant to this Section 2.4.   

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.4 to any holder of
Options or restricted stock that becomes vested by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, such amount as the Surviving Corporation is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, or local Tax Law, and the
Surviving Corporation shall make any required filings with and payments to
Taxing authorities relating to any such deduction or withholding. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Options or restricted stock,
as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation.   

(e) Nothing in this Section 2.4, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Person not a party hereto any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term
or condition of employment. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is
intended to, or does, constitute the establishment of, or an amendment to,
any Company Plan or any other employee benefit plan of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.   

SECTION 2.5 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Board of Directors of the
Company shall take all actions with respect to the Companys Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") as are required by Section 5.12.   

SECTION 2.6 _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted, without duplication, to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect
to Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_     

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this Article III are true and correct, except as set
forth herein or in the corresponding Section of the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub and dated as of the date of
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") or as disclosed in any
Company SEC Document (as hereinafter defined) filed on or after January 26,
2009 and prior to the date hereof (the " _Filed SEC Documents_ "), other than
the exhibits and schedules to the Filed SEC Documents or disclosures in such
Company SEC Documents referred to in the "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking
Statements" sections thereof or any other disclosures in the Filed SEC
Documents which are forward-looking in nature (it being understood that any
disclosure in the Filed SEC Documents shall be deemed disclosed with respect
to any Section of this Article III only to the extent that it is readily
apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it is applicable to
such Section).   

SECTION 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.   

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite
corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed, qualified or in good standing has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below) on the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Material Adverse
Effect_ " shall mean any effect, change, event, circumstance or occurrence
(each, an " _Effect_ ") that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business,
results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or would or would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than any Effect (i) generally affecting
(A) the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate or (B) the
economy, credit or financial or capital markets, in the United States or
elsewhere in the world, including changes in interest or exchange rates, or
(ii) resulting from (A) changes after the date hereof in Law or in
generally accepted accounting principles or in accounting standards, (B) the
announcement of this Agreement, the pendency of the Merger or the
consummation of the transactions expressly contemplated hereby, (C) acts of
war, sabotage or terrorism, or any escalation or worsening of any such acts of
war, sabotage or terrorism, (D) earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes or other
natural disasters, other than any earthquakes occurring in or affecting
California and any and all effects or consequences resulting therefrom or
related thereto which shall not be excluded under Section 3.1(a)(i) or
(ii), (E) any actions taken or failure to take action, in each case, to which
the Parent has approved, consented to or requested in writing, or compliance
with the terms of or the taking of any action required by this Agreement
(including actions required under Section 2.4 but excluding the
first sentence of Section 5.1(a)), (F) any decline in the market price, or
change in trading volume, of the capital stock of the Company, or (G) any
failure to meet any internal or public projections, forecasts or estimates of
revenue or earnings in and of itself (for the avoidance of doubt,
the exceptions in clauses (F) and (G) shall not prevent or otherwise affect a
determination that the underlying cause of any such failure is a Material
Adverse Effect); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any Effect referred to in
Sections 3.1(a)(i), 3.1(a)(ii)(A), (C), or (D) shall be taken into account
for purposes of each such respective clause only so long as such Effect does
not adversely affect the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a
materially disproportionate manner as compared to other participants in
industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate. With respect to "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " in the representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 3.3(d), 3.4, 3.17(b)(vi) and 3.18(b)(vi), the exception set
forth in Section 3.1(a)(ii)(B) shall not apply.   

(b) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing (to the extent such concepts are applicable) under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all requisite company power
and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Where applicable as a
legal concept, each Subsidiary of the Company is duly licensed or qualified to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing
or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed,
qualified or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   

(c) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, as amended to
the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Charter Documents_ ").   

SECTION 3.2 _Capitalization_.   

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the

other agreement relating to the disposition, voting or dividends with respect
to any Company Securities. All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock

or paid any dividend on, or made any other distribution in respect of, any
shares of its capital stock.   

(d) The Company Common Stock constitutes the only outstanding class of
securities of the Company registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as

_Securities Act_ ").   

(e) Section 3.2(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, the name and jurisdiction of organization of each
Subsidiary of the Company and sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
outstanding securities of each Subsidiary and the registered and beneficial
owner thereof. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company (except for
directors qualifying shares or the like) are owned directly or indirectly,
beneficially and of record, by the Company free and clear of all liens,
pledges, security interests and transfer restrictions, except for such
transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the
Securities Act, and other applicable securities laws or other encumbrances
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests). Each
outstanding share of capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company, which
is held, directly or indirectly, by the Company, is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, and there

hereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The termination of the Prior
Merger Agreement, the payment of the "Go-Shop Termination Fee" (as defined in
the Prior Merger Agreement) and the "Parent Expenses" (as defined in the
Prior Merger Agreement), the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement, and the consummation by it of the Transactions,

"Parent Expenses" (as defined in the Prior Merger Agreement), and, except for
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by it
of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception_ ").   

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined in
accordance with Section 5.2 of the Prior Merger Agreement that the Merger and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby constitute a
"Superior Proposal" (as defined in the Prior Merger Agreement); (ii)
determined that failure to enter into this Agreement would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (iii) determined
that the termination of the Prior Merger Agreement (in accordance with
Section 7.1(d)(ii) of the Prior Merger Agreement), the payment of the "Go-
Shop Termination Fee" (as defined in the Prior Merger Agreement) and the

are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders,
(iv) declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger and the Transactions,
(v) approved the termination of the Prior Merger Agreement, the payment of
the "Go-Shop Termination Fee" (as defined in the Prior Merger Agreement) and
the "Parent Expenses" (as defined in the Prior Merger Agreement), and the

resolved, subject to Section 5.2, to recommend adoption of this Agreement
to the holders of Company Common Stock. The Board of Directors of the Company
has directed that this Agreement be submitted to the holders of Company
Common Stock for their adoption. The only vote of the stockholders of the
Company required to adopt this Agreement and approve the
transactions contemplated hereby is the Company Stockholder Approval.   

(c) At a meeting duly called and held and at which all directors were present,
the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined in
accordance with Section 5.2 of the Prior Merger Agreement that the Merger and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby constitute a
"Superior Proposal" (as defined in the Prior Merger Agreement); (ii) approved
the termination of the Prior Merger Agreement and the payment of the "Go-Shop
Termination Fee" (as defined in the Prior Merger Agreement) and the "Parent

Agreement), the entry into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, upon the terms and conditions contained herein, are fair and in the
best interests of the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock, and
(v) resolved, subject to Section 5.2, to recommend that stockholders of the
Company adopt this Agreement and that, subject to Section 5.3(a), such matter
be submitted for consideration at the Company Stockholders Meeting.   

(d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, nor performance or
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will
(i) conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Charter Documents
or of the similar organizational documents of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or (ii) assuming that the authorizations, consents and approvals
referred to in Section 3.4 and the Company Stockholder Approval are obtained
and the filings referred to in Section 3.4 are made, (x) violate any Law,
judgment, writ or injunction of any Governmental Authority applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (y) violate or constitute a default
under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any loan or credit
agreement, debenture, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, lease,
sublease, license, contract or other agreement (each, a " _Contract_ ") to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or accelerate
the Companys or, if applicable, its Subsidiaries, obligations under any
such Contract, or (z) result in the creation of any Lien on any properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of
clause (ii), for such violations, defaults or accelerations as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation
by the Company of the Transactions, nor performance or compliance by the
Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will violate or
constitute a default under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the
Prior Merger Agreement.   

(e) The affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders
Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ ") is the only vote
or approval of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which is necessary to adopt this Agreement
and approve the Transactions.   

SECTION 3.4 _Governmental Approvals_. Except for (i) the filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") of a proxy statement
relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting (as amended or supplemented from
time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and other filings required under,

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the rules of the New
York Stock Exchange, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to the DGCL, (iii)

Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company Approvals_ "), no consents or approvals
of, or filings, licenses, permits or authorizations, declarations or
registrations with, any Governmental Authority or any stock market or
stock exchange on which shares of Company Common Stock are listed for trading
are necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions, other than such other
consents, approvals, filings, licenses, permits or authorizations,
declarations or registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   

SECTION 3.5 _Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities; Information
Provided_.   

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC, on a timely basis, all
required registration statements, certifications, reports and proxy
statements with the SEC from January 30, 2007 (collectively, and in each case
including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their
respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents that are
registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities
Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other
Company SEC Documents), the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the
case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, applicable
to such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of
such respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, the
date of the filing of such amendment, with respect to the disclosures that
are amended) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC
or its staff. There has been no correspondence between the SEC and the
Company since January 30, 2007. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of
the Company SEC Documents, other than the preliminary proxy statement, filed
March 19, 2010, is the subject of ongoing SEC review. As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Companys Subsidiaries is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) under the Exchange Act.   

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included or
incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents complied as to form,
as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects
with all applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act), have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except (i) with respect to financial statements included in
Company SEC Documents filed as of the date of this Agreement, as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or (ii) as permitted by Regulation S-X) and
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
the consolidated results of their operations and changes in
shareholders equity and cash flows of such companies as of the dates and for
the periods shown. Since January 30, 2007, there has been no material change
in the Companys accounting methods or principles that would be required to
be disclosed in the Companys financial statements in accordance with GAAP,
except as described in the notes thereto.   

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) except liabilities or obligations (i) disclosed in the balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of January 25, 2010 (the "
_Balance Sheet Date_ ") (other than in the notes thereto) included in the
Filed SEC Documents, (ii) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business, (iii) as contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise in connection with the Transactions, or (iv) as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no
unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the Company or any off-balance sheet
arrangements of any type (including any off-balance sheet arrangement
required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation
S-K promulgated under the Securities Act) that have not been so described in
the Company SEC Documents nor any obligations to enter into any such
arrangements. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) under or with respect to the Prior Merger
Agreement other than the payment of the "Go-Shop Termination Fee" (as defined
in the Prior Merger Agreement) and the payment of the "Parent Expenses" (as
defined in the Prior Merger Agreement).   

(d) (i) Since January 30, 2007, subject to any applicable grace periods, the
Company has been and is in compliance in all material respects with (A) the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (B) the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.   

(ii) The Company has implemented disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably designed
to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its
Subsidiaries, required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act
is made known to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
the Company by others within those entities. Neither the Company nor, to the

SECTION 3.18 _Franchise Matters_.   

(a) Section 3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
all Franchise Agreements that are currently in effect between the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries and any Franchisee, which list identifies (i) the
name of the Franchisee and the Franchise brand, (ii) the date of the
Franchise Agreement, and (iii) the location of the franchised business or area
in which the Franchisee has the right to develop franchised businesses. Each

States is substantially similar to the form of Franchise Agreement
incorporated into the current FDD that is applicable to the type of
Franchise granted to such Franchisee, except (A) as disclosed in Section
3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or (B) changes that would not

States.   

(b) (i) Each Franchise Agreement is valid and binding on the Company and/or
any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such Subsidiary is a party thereto, as
applicable, and to the Knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto,
and is in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except for where the failure to be valid, binding, enforceable and in full
force and effect, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other
party thereto, has performed all obligations required to be performed by it
under each Franchise Agreement, except where such noncompliance,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice of the existence of any event or
condition which constitutes, or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will
constitute, a default on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any Franchise Agreement, (A) from any Material Franchisee, or (B) from
any other Franchisee except where such default, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, (iv) there are no events or conditions which constitute, or,

contemplated by this Agreement will not cause the expiration, termination or
breach of any Material Franchise Agreement, or the acceleration of any
payment obligation or the alteration of any material terms of any
Franchise Agreement, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The Franchise Agreements and the Manual materially
comply with and are enforceable in all material respects under all applicable
Laws. No Franchise Agreement contains a provision that requires the consent
or approval of the Franchisee to the Merger, and to the Knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has made any oral or written
representation, warranty or covenant to any Franchisee that a change of
control of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will not occur or that such
Franchisees its consent to any change of control would be sought or obtained
prior to or as part of any such change of control. No Franchise Agreement is
subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, and
neither the terms of the Franchise Agreement, nor the exercise of any rights
thereunder, will render the Franchise Agreement unenforceable, in whole or in
part, nor give to the Franchisee any right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim or defense, except as would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   

(c) Except for Persons who have signed Commitment Agreements (as defined in
the applicable Subsidiarys FDDs) substantially in the form attached to the
Subsidiaries current FDDs and existing Franchise Agreements under which the
Material Franchisee has the right to develop multiple franchised businesses

by the Company or any Subsidiary. No Supplier has reduced or otherwise
discontinued, or threatened to reduce or discontinue, supplying such goods,
materials or services to the Company or any Subsidiary on reasonable terms,
except for such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, would

adequate coverage against all risks customarily insured against by companies

As of the date hereof, neither the Equity Funding Letter nor Debt Commitment
Letter has been amended or modified and the respective commitments contained
in such letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Parent
or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with the Equity Funding Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter that
are payable on or prior to the date hereof. Assuming the Financing is funded
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Financing Letters and
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Article III and performance by the Company of its obligations under Section
5.1, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Funding Letter and Debt
Commitment Letter will, together with the cash or cash equivalents available
to the Company, in the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to consummate the Transactions upon the terms and
conditions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement,
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
under the Equity Funding Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter; _provided_
that Parent and Merger Sub are not making any representation regarding the
effect of the inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in Article
III. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III and performance by
the Company of its obligations under Section 5.1, Parent does not have any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub
on the date of the Closing. The Financing Letters contain all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make
Financing available to Parent on the terms therein.   

SECTION 4.6 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company a duly executed limited guarantee of the
Guarantors with respect to the Guarantee. The Guarantee is in full force and
effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the
Guarantors, and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantors
under such Guarantee.   

SECTION 4.7 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. To the knowledge of Parent, based on information available
to Parent as of the date of this Agreement, immediately after giving effect
to all of the Transactions, including the Financing, and the payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration, the Designated Consideration, and any
other repayment or refinancing of debt that may be contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter, assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to Parents
obligation to consummate the Merger as set forth herein, (b) the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III
hereof (for such purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true
and correct in all material respects), (c) the Required Information fairly
presents the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as at the end of the periods covered thereby and the
consolidated results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the periods covered thereby and (d) any estimates, projections or forecasts
of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based
upon assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, the Surviving
Corporation (i) as of such date will be able to pay its debts as they become
due and shall own property having a fair saleable value greater than the
amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and mature; and
(ii) shall not have, as of such date, unreasonably small capital to carry on
its business.   

SECTION 4.8 _Certain Arrangements_. Except as set forth in Section 4.8 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no Contracts between Parent, Merger Sub
or the Guarantors, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys
management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof that relate
in any way to the Company or the Transactions.   

SECTION 4.9 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings,
investigations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that seek to enjoin, or would
reasonably be likely to have the effect of preventing, making illegal, or
otherwise interfering with, any of the Transactions, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to prevent, materially
delay or materially impede the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Transactions.   

SECTION 4.10 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders,
financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries except for Persons whose fees and expenses will be paid
by Parent.   

SECTION 4.11 _No Other Company Representations or Warranties_. Except for
the representations and warranties set forth in Article III, Parent and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any
other Person, has made or is making any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations, including with
respect to any information provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification
obligation to Parent or Merger Sub resulting from the delivery, dissemination
or any other distribution to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or representatives,
or the use by Parent, Merger Sub or their respective stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates or representatives of any information,
documents, estimates, projections, forecasts or other forward-looking
information, business plans or other material provided or made available to
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates or representatives, including without limitation in
certain "data rooms," confidential information memoranda or
management presentations in anticipation or contemplation of any of the
Transactions, other than fraud in connection therewith.

its Subsidiaries and each of its and its Subsidiaries respective officers,
directors, employees, consultants, agents, advisors, Affiliates and other
representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to (i) immediately
cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and (ii)
request such Person to promptly return or destroy all confidential
information concerning the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries. Except as
permitted by this Section 5.2, the Company shall and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, from the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VII, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public
information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other party
information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or

Proposal.   

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time
on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a
written Takeover Proposal from any Person, which Takeover Proposal was made
or renewed on or after the date of this Agreement and that did not result
from any breach of this Section 5.2, if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish,
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Person or group of Persons who has made such Takeover Proposal; 
_provided_ that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any material non-
public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is
provided to any Person given such access which was not previously provided to
Parent or its Representatives; and (y) engage in or otherwise participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such
Takeover Proposal; provided, further that the Company shall promptly provide
to Parent (and in any event within 48 hours) (i) a copy of any Takeover
Proposal made in writing provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
and the identity of the Person making the Takeover Proposal, and (ii) a
written summary of the material terms of any such Takeover Proposal not made
in writing. From and after the date hereof, the Company shall not grant any
waiver, amendment or release under any standstill agreement without the prior
written consent of Parent. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any confidentiality and
standstill agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable to
the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, it being
understood that such confidentiality agreements need not prohibit the
submission of Takeover Proposals or amendments thereto to the Companys Board
of Directors.   

(c) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Takeover Proposal (whether made before or after the date
hereof) on a current basis (and in any event within 48 hours) and shall
notify Parent of the status of such Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that
it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement
with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company
from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Section
5.2.   

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2(d) or Section 5.2(e),
the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i)(A) fail to recommend to
its stockholders that the Company Stockholder Approval be given (the "

Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw
or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (C)
take any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in

recommendation against such offer or a temporary "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend to the stockholders of the Company a Takeover
Proposal (actions described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement or agreement in principle with respect to any Takeover
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each, a "
_Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (iii) take any action pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to
the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the
Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Takeover Proposal, if and only if, prior to taking such action, the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation
with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (x) that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (w) the
Company has given Parent at least four business days prior written notice of
its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of
the party making such Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Proposal), (x) the Company has negotiated, and has caused
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such
notice period to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
revise the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Guarantee
such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute
a Superior Proposal, (y) following the end of such notice period, the Board
of Directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any changes
to this Agreement, the Financing Letters and the Guarantee proposed in
writing by Parent, and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be
given effect, and (z) in the event of any material change to the material
terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this Section 5.2 and _provided_ , _further_ , that any purported termination
of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of no force and
effect, unless the Company termination is in accordance with Section 7.1 and
the Company pays Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.3
prior to or concurrently with such termination.   

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but not after, the Board of
Directors of the Company may change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify,
or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (" _Change
of Recommendation_ ") in response to an Intervening Event if the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation
with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
taking such action, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company has given
Parent at least four business days prior written notice of its intention to
take such action and a description of the Intervening Event, (y) the Company
has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent during such notice period to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement, the
Financing Letters and the Guarantee in such a manner that would obviate the
need for taking such action as a result of an Intervening Event and (z)
following the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement,
the Financing Letters and the Guarantee proposed in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Change
of Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.   

(f) Except to the extent provided in Section 5.2(d) or Section 5.2(e), nothing
in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, if failure to do so would violate
applicable Law.   

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries but
including, for the avoidance of doubt, Western Parent, Thomas H. Lee Equity
Fund VI, L.P. and their respective Affiliates) or "group", within the meaning
of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, relating to, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, any (A) acquisition of assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries equal to more than 20% of the Companys consolidated
assets or to which more than 20% of the Companys revenues or earnings on a
consolidated basis are attributable, (B) acquisition of more than 20% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning more than 20%
of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (D) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company or (E) any combination of
the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of
consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and Company Common
Stock involved is more than 20%; in each case, other than the
Transactions.   

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated
in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory and
financial aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if
consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger (including any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
proposal or otherwise), _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition of
Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."   

SECTION 5.3 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.   

(a) Subject to Section 5.3(b), the Company, acting through the Board of
Directors, shall take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, its
Company Charter Documents and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange to

of time in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (ii) if as of the
time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company

quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders
Meeting.   

(b) The Company shall prepare (with the assistance of Parent) and file a
preliminary Proxy Statement or an amendment to the Companys preliminary
proxy statement, dated March 19, 2010, and, if applicable, a Rule 13e-3

following the date hereof (and, in any event, within 15 days from the date of
this Agreement) with the SEC and the Company and the Company shall file it
with the SEC and the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in
connection with the preparation of the foregoing. The Company shall use its

Companys stockholders at the earliest practicable time after the resolution
of all such comments. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt

additional information and will supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of the Companys Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to

any amendment or supplement thereto. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company in
writing the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy

writing for inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in the Proxy Statement
will not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and

of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Subject to
applicable Law, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or filing any other required
filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Proxy Statement or respond and shall consider in good faith and include in
such document or response comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company
shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not, on the date it is first
mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or
warranty with respect to the information supplied to it in writing by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement.   

SECTION 5.4 _Filings; Consents; Other Actions_.   

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions
to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), and (ii)
obtain the Company Approvals and all other approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions. The Company and Parent shall, and the Company shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third party approvals, consents, authorizations and other
confirmations that are (i) necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions or (ii) in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (A)
required to prevent a Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to the
Effective Time or (B) otherwise reasonably requested by Parent from time to
time prior to the time that the Company mails the Proxy Statement to its
stockholders. In the event that the Company shall fail to obtain any third
party approval, consent, authorization or other confirmation described in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent,
to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent resulting, or which
could reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time, from the
failure to obtain such approval, consent, authorization or other
confirmation. In no event shall Parent or Merger Sub (or any of their
respective Affiliates) be required to divest, hold separate, agree to
conduct, license or otherwise limit the use of any of their (or any of their
Subsidiaries) properties or assets (including, after the Merger, the
properties and assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). For
purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority
that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.   

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event, the Company shall use best efforts to file such
Notification and Report Form within ten business days of the date hereof and
to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this Section 5.4 necessary to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (including
any extensions thereof) as soon as practicable; and (ii) the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action
necessary to ensure that the restrictions of state takeover statute
or similar Law are not applicable to any of the Transactions and (y) if the
restrictions of any state takeover statute or similar Law become applicable
to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law
on the Transactions.   

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of the parties hereto shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult the other on, all the information relating to the other parties and
their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions, other than
"4(c) documents" as that term is used in the rules and regulations under the
HSR Act.   

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.4, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by a Governmental Authority with respect to the application of
Antitrust Laws to the Transactions.   

SECTION 5.5 _Financing_.   

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letters and
shall not permit any amendment, modification or replacement of the Financing
Letters, if such amendment, modification or replacement (x) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financing or (y) imposes new or additional conditions
or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (i) delay or
prevent the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
the Financing) on the Closing Date or (ii) adversely impact the ability of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable to enforce its rights
against other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive documents
with respect thereto in each of clauses (i) and (ii) in any material
respect. Parent shall deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment,
modification or replacement. For purposes of this Section 5.5, references to
" _Financing_ " shall include the financing contemplated by the Financing
Letters as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section
5.5(a) and references to " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall include such
documents as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section
5.5(a). Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts (i) to negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter, (ii) to satisfy all conditions to funding in the Debt
Commitment Letter applicable to it that are within its control and consummate
the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (iii) to enforce its rights
under the Debt Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and
provide to the Company copies of the material definitive documents for the
Financing. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (A) Parent
and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company and (B) Parent and Merger
Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions with terms and conditions no less favorable,
taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub (or their affiliates) than the
terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Letters as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the
final day of the Marketing Period. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing, is
not a condition to Closing. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 5.5 or in any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub be required (1) to amend or waive any of the terms or
conditions hereof or (2) to consummate the Closing any earlier than the final
day of the Marketing Period. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 5.5 or in any other provision of this Agreement, Parent and Merger
Sub shall give the Company prompt written notice: (i) of any material breach
or default by any party to any Financing Letters or definitive document
related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Letters; (ii) of
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
financing source with respect to any: (A) material breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Letters of any
provisions of the Financing Letters or (B) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any Financing Letters; and (iii) if for any
reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it is reasonably
likely that it will not be able to obtain all or any material portion of the
Financing in the amounts or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Letters and that it is not reasonably likely that it will be able to obtain
acceptable alternative financing prior to the final day of the Marketing
Period; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall be under no obligation
to disclose any information that is subject to an attorney-client or similar
privilege.   

(b) The Company shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, at Parents sole expense, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives, including legal and
accounting, to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent or
Merger Sub and all cooperation that is customary, necessary or advisable in
connection with arranging and obtaining of the Financing or any permitted
replacement, amended, modified or alternative financing (collectively with
the Financing, the " _Available Financing_ ") and the other Transactions (
_provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including
(i) assisting with the preparation of offering and syndication documents and
materials, including prospectuses, private placement memoranda, information
memoranda and packages, lender and investor presentations, rating agency
presentations, and similar documents and materials, in connection with the
Available Financing (all such documents and materials, collectively, the "
_Offering Documents_ "), (ii) preparing and furnishing Parent and Merger Sub
and their financing sources as promptly as practicable with all Required
Information and all other information and disclosures relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including their businesses, operations, financial
projections and prospects) as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Merger
Sub to assist in preparation of the Offering Documents (including execution
of customary authorization and management representation letters and
certificates), (iii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Available Financing,
including direct contact between senior management and Representatives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and Parents and Merger Subs financing
sources and potential lenders and investors in the Available Financing, and
obtaining any corporate, credit and ratings from rating agencies contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter, (iv) obtaining accountants comfort letters
and consents from the Companys independent auditors, (v) assisting in the
preparation of, and executing and delivering, definitive financing documents,
including guarantee and collateral documents, hedging agreements and other
certificates and documents as may be requested by Parent or Merger Sub
(including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company and
its Subsidiaries with respect to solvency matters), (vi) facilitating the
pledging of collateral for the Available Financing, including taking
commercially reasonable actions necessary to permit the financing sources of
the Available Financing to evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries real
property and current assets, cash management and accounting systems,
policies and procedures for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements and establishing, as of the Effective Time, bank and other
accounts and blocked account agreements and lockbox arrangements
in connection with the Available Financing, (vii) using commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that the financing sources benefit from the
existing lending relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (viii)
using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations and instruments which may be reasonably requested
by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Available Financing and
collateral arrangements, including customary payoff letters, lien releases,
instruments of termination or discharge, legal opinions, surveys,
title insurance and landlord consents, waivers and access agreements and (ix)
facilitating the consummation of the Available Financing, including
cooperating with Parent and Merger Sub to satisfy the conditions precedent to
the Available Financing to the extent within the control of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence
of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub to permit
the consummation of the Available Financing and to permit the proceeds
thereof to be made available to the Surviving Corporation immediately upon
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, no obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or
instrument (other than the authorization and representation letters and
certificates referred to above) shall be effective until the Effective Time
and, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection
with the Available Financing prior to the Effective Time. The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Available Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 5.5(b) and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs
or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection
therewith, except with respect to any information prepared or provided by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All material non-public information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to
this Section 5.5(b) shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that (i) Parent and Merger Sub shall be
permitted to disclose such information to potential sources of capital,
rating agencies and prospective lenders and investors during syndication of
the Available Financing subject to the potential sources of capital, ratings
agencies and prospective lenders and investors entering into customary
confidentiality undertakings with respect to such information (including
through a notice and undertaking in a form customarily used in
confidential information memoranda for senior credit facilities) and (ii)
upon reasonable notice from Parent, the Company agrees to file with the SEC a
Form 8-K or Form FD, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, containing any material non-public information with respect to
the Company or its subsidiaries contained in any offering memorandum to be
used in connection with the offering of high yield debt securities
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter.   

SECTION 5.6 _Public Announcements_. The press release announcing this
Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by
Parent and the Company. Except with respect to any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant thereto, and in accordance
with Section 5.2 and Article VII, so long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement, including communications to the
Companys employees or Franchisees and communications to prospective
Franchisees in any FDD or otherwise (to the extent not previously issued or
made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this
Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except
as may be required by Law, applicable fiduciary duties or by any applicable
listing agreement with a national securities exchange as determined in the
good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such release or other
public announcement (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the
publication of such press release or other public announcement without prior
consultation with the other party).   

SECTION 5.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information and upon reasonable notice, the
Company shall afford to Parent and Parents representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours to the Companys officers, employees, agents,
properties, books, Contracts and records and the Company shall
furnish promptly to Parent such information concerning its business,
personnel, assets, liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably
request (other than any publicly available document filed by it pursuant to
the requirements of Federal or state securities Laws); _provided_ that Parent
and its representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to provide
such access or information if the Company determines, in its reasonable
judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract
or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third-party, waive the protection
of an attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine, or expose
the Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company
does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence,
it shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent
feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege.
Without limiting the generality of this Section 5.7, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company will furnish to the Parent
promptly after becoming available, monthly financial statements including an
unaudited balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows for
each month through the Closing Date, as well as any update of its outlook for
the quarter or the balance of the fiscal year, as it may prepare for
managements internal use. Until the Effective Time, the information provided
will be subject to the terms of the letter agreement, dated as of February
26, 2010, between the Company and Apollo Management VII, L.P. (as it may
be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall
cause its representatives not to, use such information for any purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions.   

SECTION 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions or any
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary that are material to the ongoing
operations of the Company or such Subsidiary in the ordinary course of
business.   

SECTION 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.   

(a) From and after the Effective Time, through the sixth anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless, each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (in all of
such individuals capacities as such officer or director) (each, an "
_Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to and
against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with
any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on,
arising out of, or related to, in whole or in part, such Indemnitees service
and for such Indemnitees acts or omissions, as a director or officer of the
Company or such Subsidiary or service performed by such Indemnitee at the
request of the Company or a Subsidiary, in each case, at, or at any time
prior to, the Effective Time (including, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) any
claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part
to the Transactions and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any
other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee), and (iii)
without limiting clauses (i) and (ii), assume all obligations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time as provided in the Company Charter Documents and the
organizational documents of its Subsidiaries as currently in effect, all of
the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time until six
years from the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law,
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than
are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company
Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the Effective Time
until six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay any expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.9 (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this Section 5.9) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be determined that such person
is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.9(a). The rights
of the Indemnitees under this Section 5.9(a) shall be in addition to any
rights such Indemnitees may have under the Company Charter Documents and the
organizational documents of its Subsidiaries as currently in effect.   

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
assume and control the defense of any litigation, claim or proceeding
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.9 (each, a "
_Claim_ "). The Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in
the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties
and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.   

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who
are currently (and any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time
become) covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
policy on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no
less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the
date hereof (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable
insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters existing or
occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a "tail" policy); _provided_
_,_ _however_ , that, if the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance
shall exceed 300% of the current aggregate annual premium (such 300%, the "
_Maximum Premium_ "), then Parent shall provide or cause to be provided a
policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be
available at an annual premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium. The
Company may prior to the Effective Time, with Parents prior written consent,
purchase a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing
at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and
its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by the Company, it
shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to
this Section 5.9(c) and the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect,
for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.   

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor
of any Indemnified Party as provided in the Charter Documents or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnitee and the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such Indemnitee. The obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee
to whom this Section 5.9 applies unless (x) such termination or modification
is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9).   

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.9.   

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.   

SECTION 5.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.   

SECTION 5.11 _Employee Matters_.   

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to active employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") annual base salary and base
wages, cash incentive compensation opportunities and benefits (excluding
equity-based compensation), that are no less favorable, in the aggregate,
than such annual base salary and base wages, cash incentive compensation
opportunities and benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) provided to
the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Surviving
Corporation from, consistent with the Companys past practice, terminating
the employment of any employee of the Company or demoting any such employee
(with a corresponding change, if applicable, to such employees base salary
or wages and benefits).   

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits
(but not actual accrual) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employee after the Effective
Time (including the Company Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee
benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in
a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts, to provide that (i)
each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such
New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Plan in which such
Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to
any Company Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were
inapplicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or
its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Company Employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.   

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.11 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall
be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or
have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.   

SECTION 5.12 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.   

(a) The Company shall take all actions necessary to (i) suspend the ESPP as of
the date hereof and terminate the ESPP in its entirety as of the Effective
Date, (ii) ensure that (A) no payroll deductions shall be made and no other
amounts shall be set aside for the purchase of shares under the ESPP on or
after the date of this Agreement, (B) no offering period shall be commenced on
or after the date of this Agreement, and (C) any amount withheld from pay and
not yet applied to the purchase of shares as of the date hereof shall be
returned to the participants pursuant to the terms of the ESPP without any
interest thereon, and (iii) provide that the amount of any
matching contribution that would otherwise be or become payable in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be
paid in cash to the appropriate person (subject to applicable tax
withholding) at the same date on which such matching contributions otherwise
would have become vested under the ESPP, _provided_ that each such person has
satisfied or satisfies all requirements (including the service requirement)
under the terms of the ESPP in effect as of the date of this Agreement.   

(b) After the Effective Time, Parent shall take all such actions as are
reasonably necessary to cause the Company to provide that the amount of any
matching contribution that would otherwise be or become payable in accordance

Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any
material failure of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be,
or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.13 will not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the
conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger.   

SECTION 5.14 _SEC Filings_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall

to the execution of this Agreement, the Company has made a payment to Western
Parent (or its designee) of $9,283,000 which amount represents the "Go-Shop

(such payment the " _Western Termination Fee_ "). Under the terms of the
Prior Merger Agreement, the Company is obligated to reimburse Western Parent
(or its designee) for up to $5,000,000 in "Parent Expenses" (as such term is
defined in the Prior Merger Agreement) and shall pay such amount promptly as
required by the terms of the Prior Merger Agreement (such amount the "
_Western Expense Reimbursement_ ").

Date was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement; or   

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.1(e) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to a party if the issuance of such final,

to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or   

(iii) if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Stockholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate

Company if the failure by the Company to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement has been the principal cause or resulted in the failure to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; or   

(c) by Parent,   

(i) if: (A) the Company shall have materially breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in

warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.3 not being satisfied; or (B)
the Company shall have breached in any material respect its obligations under
Section 5.2, which breach, if curable by the Company, shall not have been

(d) by the Company:   

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have materially breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.3 and (B) has not
been cured by the Walk-Away Date; _provided_ that, the Company shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)(i) if
it is then in material breach of any representations, warranties, covenants
or other agreements hereunder that would result in the conditions to Closing
set forth in Section 6.2 not being satisfied; or   

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in order to
concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement that constitutes a

forth in such Debt Commitment Letters upon the consummation of such Equity
Financing; and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that all conditions
set forth in Section 6.3 have been satisfied or that it is willing to waive
all conditions in Section 6.3, and the Merger shall not have been consummated
within five business days after the receipt of such Financing and the
Companys delivery of a written notice to Parent of the satisfaction of such

SECTION 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to
which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void (other than Sections 7.2 and 7.3, Article VIII, the
expense reimbursement and indemnification provisions of Section 5.5(b) and
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee in accordance with their
terms, all of which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there
shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates, except (i) the
Company or the Parent may have liability as provided in Section 7.3, and (ii)
nothing shall relieve any party from liability for fraud.   

SECTION 7.3 _Termination Fee_.   

(a) In the event that:   

(i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made, proposed or communicated,
after the date hereof and not withdrawn prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting or prior to the termination of this Agreement if there has been no
Company Stockholders Meeting, and (B) following the occurrence of an event
described in the preceding clause (A), this Agreement is terminated by the
Company or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(iii) or by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) and (C) within 12 months of the date
this Agreement is terminated, the Company enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to any Takeover Proposal and such Takeover Proposal is
consummated (in each case whether or not the Takeover Proposal was the same
Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (A)); _provided_ that for purposes of
clause (C) of this Section 7.3(a)(i), the references to "20%" in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%";
or   

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(ii); or   

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(ii) or (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) and prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting
the Board of Directors of the Company has made a Change of Recommendation
related to an Intervening Event;   

then, in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section
7.3(a), the Company shall pay as directed by Parent the Termination Fee (as
defined below), by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of Section
7.3(a)(iii), within two business days after such termination,
(y) simultaneously with such termination if pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii),
or (z) in the case of Section 7.3(a)(i), two business days after the earlier
of the entry into a Company Acquisition Agreement or the consummation of a
Takeover Proposal; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used
herein, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $15,471,000,
except in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 7.1(d)(ii) in order to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Takeover Proposal with Thomas H. Lee Equity Fund VI, L.P. or any
of its Affiliates, in which case the Termination Fee shall mean a cash amount
equal to $15,471,000 plus an amount equal to the Western Termination Fee plus
the Western Expense Reimbursement. In the event that Parent shall receive
full payment pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(c), the receipt
of the Termination Fee and Parent Expenses shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent,
Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of
their respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of its
Affiliates arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 7.3(a)
shall limit the rights of Parent and Merger Sub under Section 8.9.   

(b) In the event that the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(i), Section 7.1(d)(iii) or Section 7.1(d)(iv), then:   

(i) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) or Section
7.1(d)(iii), if at such time, the Company is not in material breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that
would result in the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.2 not being
satisfied and all conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligations to
consummate the Merger shall have been satisfied, then Parent shall pay to the
Company a termination fee of $15,471,000 in cash; or   

(ii) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(iv), if at such
time, the Company is not in material breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder that would result in the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.2 not being satisfied and all
conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the
Merger shall have been satisfied, then Parent shall pay to the Company a
termination fee of $30,943,000 in cash;   

(such payment, as applicable, the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), such payment
to be made by wire transfer of same day funds within two business days after
the termination of this Agreement; it being understood that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. In the event that the Company shall receive full payment pursuant
to this Section 7.3(b), the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by the Company or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing Letters or the Guarantee (and the termination
hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (and the abandonment
or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination,
and neither the Company nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Buyer Party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the
Financing Letter or the Guarantee, any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming
the basis for such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if
a court of competent jurisdiction has ordered Parent or Merger Sub to pay the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.3(b), the Company shall not
be entitled to enforce such order if (x) Parent delivers to the Company,
within five business days following the issuance of such order, a notice
electing to consummate the Closing in accordance with Article II of this
Agreement and (y) the Closing occurs within three business days following the
delivery of such notice.   

(c) In the event that:   

(i) The Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii)
or Section 7.1(d)(ii); or   

(ii) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii),
Section 7.1(c)(i) or Section 7.1(c)(ii);   

then in any such event, the Company shall pay Parent or its designees, as
promptly as possible (but in any event within two business days) following
the delivery by Parent of an invoice therefor, all out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by Parent or its Affiliates in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Parent Expenses_ ");
_provided_ that the Company shall not be required to pay more than an
aggregate of $5.0 million in Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 7.3(c).
The expenses payable pursuant to this Section 7.3(c) shall be paid by wire
transfer of same day funds within ten business days after demand therefor
following the occurrence of the termination event giving rise to the payment
obligation described in this Section 7.3(c). The payment of the expense
reimbursement pursuant to this Section 7.3(c) shall not relieve the Company
of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section
7.3(a).   

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely
pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain the
payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the other party for the payment set forth in
this Section 7.3, such paying party shall pay the other party its reasonable
and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amount at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment
was actually received.   

ARTICLE VIII    

 _Miscellaneous_     

SECTION 8.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. This Article VIII
and the agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Article
II, Section 5.9 (Indemnification and Insurance) and the indemnification and
reimbursement obligations of Parent pursuant to Section 5.5(b) (Financing)
and Section 7.2 (Effect of Termination), the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Guarantee shall survive the termination of this Agreement (in the case of
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee, subject to the terms
thereof). All other representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
this Agreement shall not survive the consummation of the Merger or the
termination of this Agreement.   

SECTION 8.2 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and
the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring or required to incur
such fees or expenses, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement.   

SECTION 8.3 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, by
written agreement of each of the parties hereto, by action taken by their
respective Boards of Directors; _provided_ , _however_ , that
following approval of the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company,
there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law
would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company without
such approval.   

SECTION 8.4 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such partys conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.   

SECTION 8.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the other parties; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Parent or Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to any Subsidiary thereof (
_provided_ that such designation shall not impede or delay the consummation of
the Transactions or otherwise materially impede the rights of the
stockholders of the Company under this Agreement). No assignment by any Party
shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted
under this Section 8.5 shall be null and void.   

SECTION 8.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties.   

SECTION 8.7 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
and the exhibits hereto, together with the other instruments referred to
herein, including the Financing Letters, Confidentiality Agreement and the
Guarantee constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
and their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. Except for: (i) if the Effective Time occurs, (A) the
right of the Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration at
the Effective Time and (B) the right of the holders of Options to receive
the Designated Consideration promptly after the Effective Time; and (ii) the
provisions set forth in Section 5.9, this Agreement is not intended, and
shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any person or to otherwise
create any third-party beneficiary hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each Financing Source is intended to be, and shall be, a third party
beneficiary of, and shall be entitled to enforce, the agreements contained in
Section 7.3(b), 8.8(b), 8.8(c), 8.9(b), 8.9(c) and 8.10.   

SECTION 8.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.   

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.   

(b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State
of Delaware) and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such action or
proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction
and venue set forth in this paragraph shall not constitute general consents to
service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any
purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to
confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. The parties hereto
agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any partys rights
to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final
trial court judgment.   

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against the Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this agreement,
including, but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Financing Letters or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if

or she has read Section 5.2 of the Merger Agreement. In addition,
Stockholder, in his or her capacity as a Stockholder, agrees not to, directly

action, that would violate or otherwise be inconsistent with Section 5.2
of the Merger Agreement as if Stockholder and its Affiliates were
"Representatives" thereunder.   

SECTION 7. _Representations, Warranties and Other Agreements of
Stockholder_. Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent that, as
of the date hereof:   

(a) Stockholder is (and, except to the extent a Transfer is made pursuant to

capital stock of the Company, and the options and other rights to acquire
shares of capital stock of the Company, set forth on  _Schedule I_ attached

(b) the Shares are free and clear of any Liens, options, rights of first
refusal, co-sale rights or other encumbrances of any kind or nature (other

(d) Stockholder has full power and authority to make, enter into and carry out
the terms of this Agreement;   

(e) Stockholder agrees that it will not bring, commence, institute, maintain,
prosecute, participate in or voluntarily aid any action, claim, suit or cause
of action, in law or in equity, in any court or before any Governmental
Authority, which alleges that (i) the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Stockholder, either alone or together with any other
Company Stockholder Agreements and proxies to be delivered in connection with
the execution of the Merger Agreement, or (ii) the approval of the Merger
Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company, breaches any fiduciary
duty of the Board of Directors of the Company or any member thereof;   

(f) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by Stockholder will not, result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, modification or acceleration) (whether after the giving of
notice of or the passage of time or both) under any applicable Law or any
Contract to which Stockholder is a party or which is binding on it, him or
her or its, his or her assets and will not result in the creation of any Lien
on any of the assets or properties of Stockholder;   

(g) this Agreement has been duly executed by Stockholder and constitutes the
valid and legally binding obligation of Stockholder, enforceable against
Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i)
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity;   

(h) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by Stockholder will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority by Stockholder except for applicable
requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, and except where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, would not prevent or delay the performance by
Stockholder of his or her obligations under this Agreement in any material
respect; and   

(i) Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the
Merger Agreement in reliance upon Stockholders execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the representations and warranties of Stockholder
contained herein.   

SECTION 8. _Consent_. Stockholder consents and authorizes the Company, Parent
and their respective Affiliates to (a) publish and disclose in the Proxy

the Shares and the nature of its commitments, arrangements and understandings
under this Agreement and (b) file this Agreement as an exhibit to any
required filing with the SEC or any regulatory authority relating to the
Merger.   

SECTION 9. _Stockholder Capacity_. To the extent that Stockholder is an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed as preventing or otherwise affecting any
actions taken by Stockholder in his or her capacity as an officer or director
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or from fulfilling the obligations
of such office (including the performance of obligations required by the
fiduciary duties of Stockholder acting solely in his or her capacity as an
officer or director), and none of such actions in such capacity as an officer
or director shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement.   

SECTION 10. _Legending of Shares_. If so requested by Parent, Stockholder
hereby agrees that the Shares shall bear a legend stating that they are
subject to this Agreement.   

SECTION 11. _Termination_. This Agreement and any undertaking or waiver
granted by Stockholder hereunder shall terminate and be of no further force
or effect as of the Expiration Date; _provided_ , that upon termination of
this Agreement, Parent shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by
Stockholder to remove any legend placed upon any Shares pursuant to
Section 10; _provided, further however_ , Section 14 shall survive any
termination or expiration of this Agreement and any such termination shall
not relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of its
obligations hereunder or acts of bad faith committed prior to such
termination.   

SECTION 12. _Appraisal Rights_. Each Stockholder irrevocably waives and agrees
not to exercise any rights (including, without limitation, under Section 262
of the DGCL) to demand appraisal of any of the Shares which may arise with
respect to the Merger.   

SECTION 13. _Further Assurances_. Stockholder (in his or her capacity as such)
shall execute and deliver any additional certificate, instruments and other
documents, and take any additional actions, as Parent may deem necessary or
desirable, in the reasonable opinion of Parent, to carry out and effectuate
the purpose and intent of this Agreement.   

SECTION 14. _Miscellaneous_.   

(a) _Expenses_. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.   

(b) _Waiver_. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.   

(b) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.   

(c) _Binding Effect; Assignment_. Stockholder may not assign this Agreement
or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of Parent, and any attempted assignment without such prior
written approval shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   

(d) _Amendments_. This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or
supplemented, except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by each of the parties hereto.   

(e) _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur to Parent the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed by Stockholder in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages would not be
an adequate remedy. It is accordingly agreed that Parent shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by
Stockholder and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if subject matter
jurisdiction in the such court is not available, in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware without bond or other security being
required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.   

(f) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such state, applicable to contracts executed in and
to be performed entirely within that State.   

(g) _Jurisdiction and Venue_. In any action between or among any of the
parties, whether arising out of this Agreement or otherwise: (i) each of the
parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in New Castle
County, Delaware; (ii) if any such action is commended in a state
court, then, subject to applicable law, no party shall object to the removal
of such action to any federal court located in New Castle County, Delaware;
and (iii) each of the parties irrevocably consents to service of process by
first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepared,
to the address at which such party is to receive notice in accordance with
Section 14(l).   

(h) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that any
controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, each such party irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (each, a "
_Proceeding_ "). Each party to this Agreement certifies and acknowledges that
(i) no Representative of any other party has represented, expressly or
otherwise, that such other party would not seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver in the event of a Proceeding, (ii) such party has considered
the implications of this waiver, (iii) such party makes this waiver
voluntarily, and (iv) such party has been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this Section 14(h).   

(i) _No Agreement Until Executed_. Irrespective of negotiations among the
parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall
not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the parties hereto unless and until (i) the Board of
Directors of the Company has approved, for purposes of any applicable anti-
takeover laws and regulations or any applicable provision of the Companys
Charter Documents, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
this Agreement, (ii) the Merger Agreement is executed by all parties thereto
and (iii) this Agreement is executed by all parties hereto.   

(j) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof.   

(k) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended, and shall
not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to
create any agreement of employment with any person or to otherwise create any
third-party beneficiary hereto.   

(l) _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any party
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
