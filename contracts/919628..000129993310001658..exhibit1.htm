and declared it advisable, to terminate the Prior Merger Agreement (in accordance with Section

Agreement; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition

Company have entered into a Company Stockholder Voting Agreement, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> (the &#147;<U>Company Stockholder

the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to

and by-laws of Merger Sub, and as amended shall be the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law
(subject to Section&nbsp;5.9 hereof).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 1.6 <U>Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the directors of

appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers

<P align="center" style="font-size: 11.5pt">ARTICLE II



<P align="center" style="font-size: 11.5pt"><U>Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations; Exchange of</U><BR>
<U>Certificates; Company Stock Options</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 2.1 <U>Effect on Capital Stock</U>. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Company (&#147;<U>Company Common Stock</U>&#148;) or any shares of capital stock of Merger
Sub:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Capital Stock of Merger Sub</U>. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock
of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock</U>. All shares of Company
Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor. Any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall not represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and shall, at the election of Parent, either: (i)&nbsp;convert into shares of a class of
stock of the Surviving Corporation designated by Parent in connection with the Merger, or (ii)&nbsp;be
canceled.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Conversion of Company Common Stock</U>. Each issued and outstanding share of Company
Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.1(b) and Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to $12.55, without interest (the &#147;<U>Merger Consideration</U>&#148;). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate, which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each,
a &#147;<U>Certificate</U>&#148;) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.2(b), without interest.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 2.2 <U>Exchange of Certificates</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Paying Agent</U>. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company, which must be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as agent for the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the &#147;<U>Paying Agent</U>&#148;) to
receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of shares of Company
Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(c). Parent shall deposit or cause to be
deposited such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective
Time. Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall, pending its
disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in
(i)&nbsp;short-term direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii)&nbsp;short-term obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii)&nbsp;short-term commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor&#146;s Ratings Services, respectively, (iv)&nbsp;in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker&#146;s acceptances of commercial banks
with capital exceeding $1&nbsp;billion, or (v)&nbsp;money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of such investment.
To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the aggregate
Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent diminishes for any reason below the level
required for the Paying Agent to make cash payment under Section&nbsp;2.1(c), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash on deposit with the Paying
Agent so as to ensure that the Paying Agent at all times has cash on deposit maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such aggregate payments under Section&nbsp;2.1(c).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Payment Procedures</U>. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event more than
three business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Company Common Stock (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such form and shall have
such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) and
(ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x)&nbsp;the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
(y)&nbsp;the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate surrendered and shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by
this Article&nbsp;II, without interest.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock</U>. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article&nbsp;II shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
of Company Common Stock. Subject to the last sentence of Section&nbsp;2.2(e), if, at any time after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article&nbsp;II.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates</U>. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article&nbsp;II.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<U>Termination of Fund</U>. At any time following the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the
payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by
such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;<U>No Liability</U>. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;<U>Withholding Taxes</U>. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 2.3 <U>Appraisal Rights</U>. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or
consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section&nbsp;262 of the
DGCL (the &#147;<U>Dissenting Stockholders</U>&#148;), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the &#147;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>&#148;), but instead such
holder shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
rights set forth in Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
such right, such holder&#146;s shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had
been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.1,
without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i)&nbsp;prompt notice and a copy of any
written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to stockholders&#146; rights of appraisal, and (ii)&nbsp;the opportunity to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not make
any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice
or instrument unless Parent shall have given its written consent to such payment or settlement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 2.4 <U>Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary (including
obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company
or a committee thereof and amending any Company Stock Plan) to:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 12%">(i)&nbsp;terminate each Company Stock Plan,


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 12%">(ii)&nbsp;provide that each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted
under the Company Stock Plans (each, an &#147;<U>Option</U>&#148;) that is outstanding and unexercised
(without regard to the exercise price of such Option) as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to
and contingent on the Closing,


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 12%">(iii)&nbsp;cancel, as of the Effective Time, each Option that is outstanding and unexercised
(without regard to the exercise price of such Option), as of the Effective Time (in each case,
without the creation of additional liability to the Company or any Subsidiaries), subject, if
applicable, to the payment pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.4, and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 12%">(iv)&nbsp;provide that each restricted share of Company Common Stock, granted under the Company
Stock Plans that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully
vested immediately prior to and contingent on the Closing, and provide that each such share shall
be treated as a share of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Each holder of an Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time and
has an exercise price per share that is less than the per share Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no
later than three days after the Effective Time) a cash amount equal to the Designated Consideration
for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the Option (subject to applicable tax
withholding). For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<U>Designated Consideration</U>&#148; means, with
respect to any share of Company Common Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to
the excess, if any, of (i)&nbsp;the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (ii)&nbsp;the
exercise price payable in respect of such share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Option.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail
to each person who is a holder of an Option a letter describing the treatment of and, if
applicable, payment for such Option pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.4 and providing instructions for use
in obtaining payment for such Option. Parent shall maintain, or shall cause to be maintained, at
all times from and after the Effective Time sufficient liquid funds to pay the Designated
Consideration and to satisfy its obligations to holders of Options pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.4.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.4 to any holder of Options or restricted stock that
becomes vested by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such amount as the
Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, or local Tax Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall
make any required filings with and payments to Taxing authorities relating to any such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of Options or restricted stock, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;Nothing in this Section&nbsp;2.4, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person not
a party hereto any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any right to
employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right
to a particular term or condition of employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, constitute the
establishment of, or an amendment to, any Company Plan or any other employee benefit plan of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 2.5 <U>Employee Stock Purchase Plan</U>. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
take all actions with respect to the Company&#146;s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the &#147;<U>ESPP</U>&#148;) as
are required by Section&nbsp;5.12.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 2.6 <U>Adjustments to Merger Consideration</U>. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted, without duplication, to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 4.3 <U>Governmental Approvals</U>. Except for (i)&nbsp;any filings required under, and in

copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of (i)&nbsp;an executed commitment letter (the &#147;<U>Equity
Funding Letter</U>&#148;) from certain parties (the &#147;<U>Equity Providers</U>&#148;) to provide, subject to
the terms and conditions therein, equity financing in the aggregate amount set forth therein (being
collectively referred to as the &#147;<U>Equity Financing</U>&#148;), and (ii)&nbsp;an executed commitment letter
and a redacted form of fee letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from the financial
institutions identified therein (the &#147;<U>Debt Commitment Letter</U>&#148; and, together with the Equity
Funding Letter, the &#147;<U>Financing Letters</U>&#148;) to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein (being collectively referred to as
the &#147;<U>Debt Financing</U>&#148;, and together with the Equity Financing collectively referred to as
the &#147;<U>Financing</U>&#148;). As of the date hereof, neither the Equity Funding Letter nor Debt

letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Equity Funding Letter and the Debt

funded in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Financing Letters and assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article&nbsp;III and performance by the
Company of its obligations under Section&nbsp;5.1, the net proceeds contemplated by the Equity Funding
Letter and Debt Commitment Letter will, together with the cash or cash equivalents available to the
Company, in the aggregate be sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to consummate
the Transactions upon the terms and conditions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of
this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under the Equity Funding Letter
or the Debt Commitment Letter; <U>provided</U> that Parent and Merger Sub are not making any
representation regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of the representations and warranties in
Article&nbsp;III. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Article&nbsp;III and performance by the Company of its obligations under
Section&nbsp;5.1, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing
will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the
date of the Closing. The Financing Letters contain all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of the parties thereunder to make Financing available to Parent on the terms therein.

delivered to the Company a duly executed limited guarantee of the Guarantors with respect to the
Guarantee. The Guarantee is in full force and effect and is the valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the Guarantors, and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantors under such Guarantee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 4.7 <U>Solvency</U>. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the Transactions
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors. To the knowledge
of Parent, based on information available to Parent as of the date of this Agreement, immediately
after giving effect to all of the Transactions, including the Financing, and the payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration, the Designated Consideration, and any other repayment or
refinancing of debt that may be contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, assuming
(a)&nbsp;satisfaction of the conditions to Parent&#146;s obligation to consummate the Merger as set forth
herein, (b)&nbsp;the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Article&nbsp;III hereof (for such purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true and
correct in all material respects), (c)&nbsp;the Required Information fairly presents the consolidated
financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the end of the periods covered
thereby and the consolidated results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
periods covered thereby and (d)&nbsp;any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be
reasonable, the Surviving Corporation (i)&nbsp;as of such date will be able to pay its debts as they
become due and shall own property having a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to
pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities) as they
become absolute and mature; and (ii)&nbsp;shall not have, as of such date, unreasonably small capital to
carry on its business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 4.8 <U>Certain Arrangements</U>. Except as set forth in Section&nbsp;4.8 of the Parent

one hand, and any member of the Company&#146;s management or directors, on the other hand, as of the
date hereof that relate in any way to the Company or the Transactions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 4.9 <U>Litigation</U>. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no civil,
criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that seek to enjoin, or
would reasonably be likely to have the effect of preventing, making illegal, or otherwise
interfering with, any of the Transactions, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions.

provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as shall then be available
at an annual premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium. The Company may prior to the Effective
Time, with Parent&#146;s prior written consent, purchase a six-year prepaid &#147;tail policy&#148; on terms and
conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation
the transactions contemplated hereby. If such prepaid &#147;tail policy&#148; has been obtained by the

advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided
in the Charter Documents or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnitee and the Company

modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such Indemnitee.

reasonably be expected to facilitate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the

Company under the Merger Agreement or of Stockholder under this Agreement or otherwise impede,
interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the Merger or any of the other

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 5. <U>No Ownership Interest</U>. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to

authority to direct Stockholder in the voting of any of the Shares, except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, or in the performance of Stockholder&#146;s duties or responsibilities as

participate in or voluntarily aid any action, claim, suit or cause of action, in law or in equity,
in any court or before any Governmental Authority, which alleges that (i)&nbsp;the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder, either alone or together with any other Company
Stockholder Agreements and proxies to be delivered in connection with the execution of the Merger
Agreement, or (ii)&nbsp;the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company,
breaches any fiduciary duty of the Board of Directors of the Company or any member thereof;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder does not, and the performance
of this Agreement by Stockholder will not, result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with
or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration) (whether after the giving of notice of or
the passage of time or both) under any applicable Law or any Contract to which Stockholder is a
party or which is binding on it, him or her or its, his or her assets and will not result in the

of this Agreement by Stockholder will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority by Stockholder except for
applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, and except where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not

any material respect; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(i)&nbsp;Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement

director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
preventing or otherwise affecting any actions taken by Stockholder in his or her capacity as an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or from fulfilling the obligations of
such office (including the performance of obligations required by the fiduciary duties of
Stockholder acting solely in his or her capacity as an officer or director), and none of such

Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 10. <U>Legending of Shares</U>. If so requested by Parent, Stockholder hereby agrees
that the Shares shall bear a legend stating that they are subject to this Agreement.

Stockholder hereunder shall terminate and be of no further force or effect as of the Expiration
Date; <I>provided</I>, that upon termination of this Agreement, Parent shall take such actions as are
reasonably requested by Stockholder to remove any legend placed upon any Shares pursuant to Section
10; <I>provided, further however</I>, Section&nbsp;14 shall survive any termination or expiration of this
Agreement and any such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful
breach of its obligations hereunder or acts of bad faith committed prior to such termination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 12. <U>Appraisal Rights</U>. Each Stockholder irrevocably waives and agrees not to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 13. <U>Further Assurances</U>. Stockholder (in his or her capacity as such) shall
execute and deliver any additional certificate, instruments and other documents, and take any
additional actions, as Parent may deem necessary or desirable, in the reasonable opinion of Parent,
to carry out and effectuate the purpose and intent of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 14. <U>Miscellaneous</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Expenses</U>. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall
be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Waiver</U>. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Severability</U>. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy, all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Binding Effect; Assignment</U>. Stockholder may not assign this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of Parent, and
any attempted assignment without such prior written approval shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Amendments</U>. This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented,
except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by each of the parties
hereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;<U>Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief</U>. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur to Parent the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
Stockholder in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money
damages would not be an adequate remedy. It is accordingly agreed that Parent shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Stockholder and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if
subject matter jurisdiction in the such court is not available, in the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware without bond or other security being required, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;<U>Governing Law</U>. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such
state, applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that State.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;<U>Jurisdiction and Venue</U>. In any action between or among any of the parties, whether
arising out of this Agreement or otherwise: (i)&nbsp;each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts
located in New Castle County, Delaware; (ii)&nbsp;if any such action is commended in a state court,
then, subject to applicable law, no party shall object to the removal of such action to any federal
court located in New Castle County, Delaware; and (iii)&nbsp;each of the parties irrevocably consents to
service of process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepared, to
the address at which such party is to receive notice in accordance with Section&nbsp;14(l).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(h)&nbsp;<U>Waiver of Jury Trial</U>. Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy
which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues and,
therefore, each such party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (each, a &#147;<U>Proceeding</U>&#148;). Each party to
this Agreement certifies and acknowledges that (i)&nbsp;no Representative of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver in the event of a Proceeding, (ii)&nbsp;such party has considered the implications of this
waiver, (iii)&nbsp;such party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv)&nbsp;such party has been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this
Section&nbsp;14(h).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(i)&nbsp;<U>No Agreement Until Executed</U>. Irrespective of negotiations among the parties or the
exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute or be deemed to
evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding between the parties hereto unless and
until (i)&nbsp;the Board of Directors of the Company has approved, for purposes of any applicable
anti-takeover laws and regulations or any applicable provision of the Company&#146;s Charter Documents,
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;the Merger Agreement
is executed by all parties thereto and (iii)&nbsp;this Agreement is executed by all parties hereto.

all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of
them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 11.5pt; text-indent: 8%">(k)&nbsp;<U>No Third Party Beneficiaries</U>. This Agreement is not intended, and shall not be
deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any person
or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.
