8 ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

Section 2.01. _The Merger_. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary
shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation") and continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State
of Delaware.

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017, at 9:00 a.m.
local time on a Business Day as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any
event no later than three Business Days) after the date the conditions set
forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied
or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on
such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.

(c) At the Closing, the Company shall file a certificate of merger with the
Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required
by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is
duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may
be specified in the certificate of merger).

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of
the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the
Company or the holders of any shares of Company Stock or any shares of
capital stock of Parent or Merger Subsidiary:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or
Section 2.04, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $23.50 in cash,
without interest (such per share amount, the "Merger Consideration"). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such shares of Company Stock in accordance
with Section 2.03, without interest.

 



9 (b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company or owned by Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of Company Stock held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of either
the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.

 

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company
Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
make available to the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Such funds may be
invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable hereunder and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of
the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall
only be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with
maturities of no more than 90 days or guaranteed by the United States of
America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent
to send, to each holder of record of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares at
the Effective Time, other than shares described in Section 2.02(b) or Section
2.02(c), a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that
the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated
Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as
may be reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger

 



10  Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate
or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may
be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Article 2\.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock six
months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration
in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock
for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares
in accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal.
If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares, including a copy thereof, and Parent shall have the right
to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent or as required by
any final and non-appealable order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
Authority, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to
settle or settle, any such demands.

 



11 Section 2.05. _Company Stock Awards._

 

(a) _Stock Options_. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
option to purchase shares of Company Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option")
and each stock appreciation right which represents the right to receive a
payment in cash or shares of Company Stock (each, a "Company SAR" and together
with the Company Stock Options, the "Company Option Awards") that is then-
outstanding under any Company Stock Plan, whether or not vested or
exercisable, shall, automatically and without any action on behalf of the
holder thereof, be canceled, and the Company shall pay each holder of such
Company Option Award for each such Company Option Award an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the applicable exercise price of such Company Option Award by (ii) the
number of shares of Company Stock underlying such award (assuming full vesting
of the Company Option Award) had such holder exercised the Company Option
Award in full immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall take
all actions necessary to terminate and cancel each Company Option Award with
an exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plan without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof and the holder of such Company Option Award shall have no further
rights in respect thereof.

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each award of Company
Stock that is subject to vesting or other forfeiture conditions (each, a
"Company Restricted Share") and each restricted stock unit entitling the
holder to delivery of shares of Common Stock, subject to satisfaction of
vesting or other forfeiture conditions, whether settled in cash or in stock
(each, a "Company RSU" and together with the Company Restricted Shares, the
"Company Restricted Stock Awards") that is then-outstanding under any Company
Stock Plan, whether or not vested, automatically and without any action on
behalf of the holder or beneficiary thereof, shall be canceled, and the
Company shall pay the holder of any such Company Restricted Stock Award an
amount in cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration and the number
of shares of Company Stock represented by such Company Restricted Stock Award
and (ii) all dividends and interest, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the
Effective Time with respect to Company Restricted Shares outstanding under any
Company Stock Plan, automatically and without any action on behalf of the
holder or beneficiaries thereof, shall vest and be paid or distributed, as
applicable, to the holder of the associated Company Restricted Shares. Any
Company Restricted Stock Award for which the number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable under such award is determined based on the satisfaction of
performance conditions (a "Company Performance Stock Award") shall be deemed
to have been earned at the target level under the terms of the award
agreement relating to such Company Performance Stock Award.

 



12 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide such notice, if
any, to the extent required under the terms of the applicable Company Stock
Plan, obtain any necessary consents, and make any amendments to the terms of
any outstanding Company Option Award or Company Restricted Stock Award to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05. All payments
under this Section 2.05 shall be made at or as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, pursuant to the Companys ordinary payroll practices, and
shall be subject to any applicable withholding.

Section 2.06. _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results
from any exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase
shares of Company Stock granted under the Companys stock option or
compensation plans or arrangements, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Stock, Company Stock
Options, Company SARs, Company Restricted Shares or Company RSUs, as the case
may be, in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

Section 2.08. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article 2\.

termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled under, or result in triggering any payment or other

Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective properties or
assets are bound or affected or (d) result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
with only such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (b) through (d), as
would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

be so organized, existing and (where applicable) in good standing as and
those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of
which would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign entity and (where applicable) is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except
for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in

available to Parent a copy of each of its Subsidiaries certificate or
articles of incorporation, as applicable, and by-laws or other equivalent
organizational documents as currently in effect. None of its Subsidiaries is

reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

securities of, and ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights and are owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free
and clear of any Liens (other than Liens arising by operation of law or

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligations of the Company or

or exchangeable for, any capital stock or other equity or voting securities
of, or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) any
rights (either preemptive or other and including restricted shares, stock
appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights, "phantom"
stock or similar securities or rights) that are derivative of, or provide
economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any
capital stock or other equity or voting securities of, or ownership interests
in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iii)
being referred to collectively as the "Company Subsidiary Securities"). There
are no outstanding obligations (contingent or otherwise) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire any
of the Company Subsidiary Securities. Other than the ownership of the

The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the 1934 Act)
designed to ensure, and the Company has no reasonable basis to believe
such controls and procedures are not effective to ensure, that material

is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the
preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure
documents. The Company has established and maintains a system of internal
accounting controls and financial reporting sufficient to comply with all

designed by the Company to be, and the Company has no reason to believe it is
not, effective, in each case, to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed,

auditors and its audit committee (i) any "significant deficiencies" and
"material weaknesses" (as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board) within the knowledge of the Company in the design or operation of its
internal accounting controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, known to the Company
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
internal controls. Since January 2, 2010, the Company has not received any
written material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim in writing
regarding the accounting practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
the Company or its internal accounting controls, including any such
complaint, allegation assertion or claim that the Company has engaged in

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act)), where the
result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys published
financial statements or other Company SEC Documents.

recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedule, if any;
(iii) any current summary plan description; (iv) the most recent annual
financial report, if any; and (v) the most recent actuarial report, if any.
Except as specifically provided in the foregoing documents, or in other

Company or any ERISA Affiliate committed (whether or not such commitment
is legally binding) to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any

Time, any liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection with the
termination of any such Company U.S. Plan. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, with respect to each Multiemployer Plan, (A) neither the Company nor
any of its ERISA Affiliates has in the past six years incurred any liability
on account of a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (within the
meaning of Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, respectively) from any
Multiemployer Plan and (B) to the Companys knowledge, no event has occurred
and no condition or circumstance has existed, that presents a material risk of
the occurrence of any withdrawal by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of its ERISA Affiliates from or the partition, termination, reorganization
or insolvency of any such Multiemployer Plan which could result in any
liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any such Multiemployer
Plan. 

(c) Each Company U.S. Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section

letter, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application
for such determination or opinion from the Internal Revenue Service, and the
Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination letter or

determination and opinion letters with respect to each such Company U.S. Plan.

 

(d) Each Company Employee Plan has been maintained in material compliance, and
is now in compliance, with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
all statutes and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which are
applicable to such Company Employee Plan. Except as would not reasonably be

Material Adverse Effect, no claim (other than routine claims for benefits),
action, suit or proceeding (including an audit) is pending against or involves
or, to the Companys knowledge, is threatened against or reasonably expected
to involve, any Company Employee Plan or any fiduciaries thereof before any
court or arbitrator or any Governmental Authority, including the Internal
Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor or the PBGC.

 

(e) The consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not, either alone or together with any other event: (i)
entitle any Company Employee to any payment or benefit, including any bonus,
retention, severance, retirement or job security payment or benefit, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation under,
any Company Employee Plan, (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, after the Effective Time, Parent, to merge, amend
or terminate any Company Employee Plan or (iv) give rise to the payment of any
amount under any Company Employee Plan that would not be deductible pursuant
to the terms of Section 280G of the Code. Since January 1, 2013, none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made any payment or award to any
Company Employee in respect of any severance, transaction bonus, retention
payment or other similar award in connection with the sale or change in
control of the Company.

 



27 (f) Each Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been operated in
material compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2005. Each
person on the payroll records of Company is properly classified as an employee
or independent contractor, and has been properly classified on their payroll
records as exempt or nonexempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act or any
applicable state or foreign law equivalent, except to the extent that failure
to do so has not created any extant material liability. No Company Employee
Plan provides for post-retirement or post-employment welfare benefits (other
than healthcare continuation coverage required under applicable Federal or
state law). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever
maintained or contributed to, or had any obligation to contribute to (or borne
any liability with respect to) any "multiple employer plan" (within the
meaning of the Code or ERISA) creating any extant material liability. All

Section 5.04. _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent
and Merger Subsidiary of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby do not and will not (a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any

incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, (b) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.03, contravene, conflict

or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, acceleration or other
change of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under, any Contract binding upon Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in triggering any payment or other
rights or obligations under any Contract to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their respective properties or
assets are bound or affected or (d) result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien on any asset of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, with only such
exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (b) through (d), as would not have
or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent

untrue statement of a

 



35  material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The representations
and warranties contained in this Section 5.05 will not apply to statements or
omissions included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based
upon information supplied by the Company or any of its representatives or
advisors specifically for use or incorporation by reference therein.

Section 5.06. _Finders  Fees_. Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co., whose fees
will be paid by Parent, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary or Person that has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of Parent who might be entitled to any fee or commission or other like
payments from Parent upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 5.07. _Financing_. (a) Parent has available to it as of the date
hereof, and will have available to it as of the date the Closing is required
to occur pursuant to Section 2.01, immediately available funds (taking into
account funds available to Parent under the Amended Credit Agreement (as
defined below)) to enable it to consummate the Merger pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, including to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and all
other amounts required to be paid in connection with the Closing pursuant to
Article 2 and to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and their respective Representatives required to be paid
in connection with the Closing pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of its
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of December 10, 2009 (as
amended by the First Amendment dated as of February 17, 2011, by the Second
Amendment dated as of July 13, 2012, by the Third Amendment dated as of July
23, 2013 and as otherwise amended and in effect on the date hereof (the
"Amended Credit Agreement")).

 

(c) There are no side letters (other than customary fee letters, engagement or
related letters (none of which contain terms that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the amount or availability of the Financing)) or
other material agreements or Contracts related to the credit facility governed
by the Amended Credit Agreement (the "Amended Credit Facility"), other than
as disclosed in any Company SEC Document filed by the Company with the SEC
prior to the date of this Agreement.

(d) The Amended Credit Agreement is in full force and effect and is a valid
and binding obligation (subject to the Enforceability Exceptions) of Parent
and, to the knowledge of Parent, the Financing Sources. As of the date
hereof, the Amended Credit Agreement has not been amended or modified in any
material respect, except for such amendments or modifications that have been
disclosed in any Form 10-K or 10-Q or 8-K, as applicable, filed by Parent
with the SEC prior to the date hereof, and the respective commitments
contained therein have not been withdrawn in writing, rescinded in writing or
otherwise modified in any material respect (other than customary assignments
and participations of commitments). As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which would constitute a default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a default), or the failure of any
condition, on the part of Parent or its

 



36  Subsidiaries under the Amended Credit Agreement or, to the knowledge of
Parent, on the part of any Financing Source. There are no conditions precedent
to the drawdown by Parent of the amount (together with cash on hand) required
to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, all other amounts required to be
paid pursuant to Article 2 and all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case, that are required to be paid in connection with the Closing (the
"Financing") other than the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 of
the Amended Credit Agreement, and Parent has no reason to believe that it
will not be able to satisfy any such condition of the Financing, or that any
representation or warranty required to be true and correct at the applicable
standard set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement for the Financing to be
available to the Parent on the Closing Date will not be so true and correct on
the Closing Date, or that the proceeds of the Financing will not be made
available to Parent on the Closing Date.

 

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Financing shall not be a
condition to the obligation of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.08. _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents obligations to consummate the Merger and (b) the accuracy in all
material respects of the representations and warranties set forth in Article
4 of this Agreement and, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Financing, the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in
this Agreement and the payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving
Corporation on a consolidated basis will be Solvent as of the Effective Time
and immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (assuming, in each case, the Surviving Corporation is Solvent
immediately prior to the Effective Time (without giving effect to any
obligations to third parties which may be accelerated as a result of
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby)). For purposes of this Agreement, "Solvent" when used with respect to
any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of
the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (A) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent
and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable federal laws governing determinations
of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be required to pay
the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts
(including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured,
(ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date and (iii) such Person will be able
to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature.

Section 5.09. _Litigation_. There is no action, arbitration, suit or
proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of the Parent, threatened in
writing against, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries before (or, in the case of
threatened actions, arbitrations, suits or proceedings, would be before) or by
any Governmental Authority or any arbitrator or arbitration tribunal, except
as would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



37 Section 5.10. _Ownership of Shares_. Except as previously disclosed to the
Company or other than pursuant to this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary or any of their Subsidiaries beneficially owns any Shares as of the
date hereof.

Section 5.11. _Absence of Certain Agreements_. To Parents knowledge, as of
the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into
any Contract, arrangement or understanding, or authorized, committed or
agreed to enter into any Contract, arrangement or understanding, pursuant to
which: (a) any stockholder of the Company in its capacity as such would be
entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the
Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company (i)
agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) agrees to vote
against any Superior Proposal or (b) any Third Party has agreed to provide,
directly or indirectly, equity capital to Parent or the Company to finance in
whole or in part the Merger.

Section 5.12. _Management Agreements_. Other than this Agreement, as of the
date hereof, there are no Contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or
obligations or understandings between Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any of
their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management
or the board of directors, on the other hand, relating in any way to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Company
after the Effective Time.

 __Section 6.02. _Company Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Statement_. (a) The
Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, to establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, and convene a meeting of its
stockholders (the " __Company Stockholder Meeting __") for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall cause the
Company Stockholder Meeting to be held (on a date selected by the Company in
consultation with Parent) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
mailing of the Proxy Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such date is in
accordance with all Applicable Laws with respect to the Company Stockholder
Meeting; _provided_ , _further_ , that (i) the Company shall have the right
to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company
Stockholder Meeting (A) with the written consent of Parent, or (B) to allow
reasonable additional time for such period of time as the Board of Directors
of the Company has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
counsel is necessary under Applicable Law or fiduciary duty for the filing and
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Board
of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith after consultation
with outside counsel is necessary under Applicable Law or fiduciary duty and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the Companys stockholders prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, and (ii)
if on a date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, (A) there
is an absence of a quorum or (B) the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a __

 



42  quorum is present, the Company may make one or more successive postponements
or adjournments (and the Company shall, at the request of Parent, make one
such postponement or adjournment if the Company has not previously effected
any such postponement or adjournment) of the Company Stockholder Meeting (
_provided_ that the Company Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned
to a date that is more than 20 days after the date on which such postponement
or adjournment is effected (excluding any adjournments or postponements
required by Applicable Law)). The notice of such Company Stockholder Meeting
shall include notice that a resolution to approve and adopt this Agreement, a
resolution to adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting to solicit additional
proxies and a resolution to vote on a non-binding advisory proposal to approve
change-in-control payments to executives of the Company will be considered at
the Company Stockholder Meeting, and no other matters shall be considered or
voted upon at the Company Stockholder Meeting without Parents prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The
Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement and in any event no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the
date hereof, prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC
or its staff and to cause the Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC as

Directors of the Company shall (i) recommend approval and adoption of this
Agreement by the Companys stockholders and shall include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and (iii) otherwise comply in all
material respects with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting. The
Companys obligations pursuant to this Section 6.02 (other than the
obligations set forth in the preceding sentence) shall not be affected by an
Adverse Recommendation Change or the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of an Acquisition Proposal, and the
Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders
of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal)
prior to the termination of this Agreement.

(b) Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the preliminary Proxy Statement each time before it is filed
with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent and its counsel. Except in
connection with actions taken pursuant to Section 6.04, the Company shall (i)
promptly provide Parent and its counsel with any written comments or other
communications, and promptly notify Parent and its counsel of any oral
comments or other communications, that the Company or its counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications
and (ii) provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the Companys response to those comments and to provide
comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration
shall be given), including by participating with the Company or its counsel
in any discussions or meetings with the SEC to the extent permitted by the
SEC. Except in connection with actions taken pursuant to Section 6.04, no
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without
providing Parent and its counsel

 



43  a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement each
time before it is filed, and the Company shall discuss with Parent, and give
reasonable and good faith consideration for inclusion in such document or
response, comments proposed by Parent. As promptly as practicable after the
Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC (or after the expiration of the
applicable period for comments from the SEC without notice from the SEC of
its intent to review the Proxy Statement), the Company shall mail the Proxy
Statement to the holders of shares of Common Stock of the Company.

(c) Parent shall furnish all information concerning Parent and its Affiliates
to the Company as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. Each of
Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees to advise the Company as promptly as
practicable if at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any
information provided by it in the Proxy Statement is or becomes incorrect or
incomplete in any material respect and to provide the Company with the
information needed to correct such inaccuracy or omission. Parent and Merger
Subsidiary will furnish the Company with such supplemental information as may
be necessary in order to cause the Company Proxy Statement, insofar as it
relates to Parent and its Affiliates, to comply with Applicable Law after the
mailing thereof to the stockholders of the Company.

 

(d) The Company agrees to advise Parent as promptly as practicable if at any
time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information provided by it
in the Proxy Statement is or becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material
respect and to supplement the Proxy Statement with the information needed to
correct such inaccuracy or omission. The Company will furnish such
supplemental information as may be necessary in order to cause the Proxy
Statement to comply with Applicable Law after the mailing thereof to
stockholders of the Company.

Section 6.03. _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the confidentiality agreement
dated May 13, 2013, between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), the Company shall (a) give Parent, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives, upon reasonable
notice, reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices,
properties, books, contracts and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(b) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives such financial and operating data and other
information as such Persons may reasonably request and (c) instruct its
employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives to cooperate reasonably with Parent in its investigation
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.03 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require the Company to
provide any access, or to disclose any information (i) if providing such
access or disclosing such information would violate Applicable Law (including
antitrust and privacy laws) or any binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement or (ii) protected by attorney-client privilege to
the extent such privilege cannot be protected by the Company through exercise
of its reasonable efforts; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company will
use its

 



44  reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which any of the preceding restrictions
apply. No investigation made pursuant to this Section shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement or any condition to the
obligations of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger.

__Section 6.04. _No Solicitation; Other Offers_. (a) Subject to the remainder
of this Section 6.04, upon execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants
and other advisors or representatives (collectively, " __Representatives __")
to, immediately cease or cause to be terminated any and all activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall promptly after the date of this Agreement instruct
each Third Party which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal with or for the benefit of the Company to
promptly return or destroy all information, documents, and materials relating
to the Acquisition Proposal or to the Company or its businesses, operations
or affairs heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives
to such Person or any of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of
any confidentiality agreement with such Person. Subject to Section 6.04(b)
and Section 6.04(c), from the execution of this Agreement until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article 10, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not authorize any of its or their
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any
action to knowingly facilitate, encourage or assist, or knowingly induce the
making, submission or announcement of, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other
information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise knowingly
cooperate in any way with any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has
made, or could reasonably be expected to make, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve, adopt, endorse, or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to
make, withhold, withdraw or amend, qualify or modify, in each case in a manner
adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or amend, modify
or qualify, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation, (v) propose publicly to approve, adopt, endorse or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing in clause (iii), (iv) or (v),
whether taken by the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof being referred to as an " __Adverse Recommendation Change __"), (vi)
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument
contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or (vii) take
any action to make the provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by an
Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ that no action expressly permitted by
Section 8.08 with respect to any standstill provision in any agreement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party shall constitute a
breach of this Section 6.04. _ _

 



45 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 6.04(a) to the contrary, if
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the
Company or any of its Representatives has received a _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably
believes, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
action with respect to such Acquisition Proposal would likely be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (iii) such Acquisition
Proposal was not the result of a breach of Section 6.04(a) and (iv) the
Company provides to Parent in accordance with Section 6.04(d) the information
required under Section 6.04(d) to be delivered by the Company to Parent, then,
so long as the foregoing conditions in the immediately preceding clauses
(i)-(iv) remain satisfied, the Company, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third
Party and its Representatives with respect to the Acquisition Proposal, and
(B) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall concurrently
provide to Parent any such information that is provided to any such Person
which was not previously provided to or made available to Parent.

(c) In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the 1934 Act, (ii) making any legally required disclosure to
the Companys stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that neither the
Company nor its Board of Directors may recommend any Acquisition Proposal
unless expressly permitted by Section 6.04(e)), (iii) contacting and engaging
in discussions with any person or group and their respective Representatives
who has made an Acquisition Proposal that was not the result of a breach of
this Section 6.04 solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition
Proposal and the terms thereof or (iv) issuing a "stop, look and listen"
disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the 1934 Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure of a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act other than (A) a "stop, look
and listen" communication limited solely to the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act, (B) any express rejection of any applicable
Acquisition Proposal or (C) any express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation, shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change. No
change, withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation shall
change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of
causing any law (including Section 203 of Delaware Law) to be inapplicable to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions
referred to in Section 6.04(b) unless the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action. In addition, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) orally and in writing after the receipt by 

 



46  the Company (or any of its Representatives) of (i) any Acquisition Proposal,
or (ii) any request for information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party with
respect to an actual or potential Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall also
provide the identity of the Third Party making, submitting, inquiring about
or expressing interest with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (except to
the extent disclosure of such identity would breach a confidentiality
obligation in effect prior to the execution of this Agreement) and (A) if it
is in writing, a copy of such Acquisition Proposal and any related draft
agreements and other written material from such Third Party (which, in each
case, may be redacted, if necessary, solely to remove the identity of such
Third Party in order to comply with a confidentiality obligation in effect
prior to the execution of this Agreement) setting forth the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and (B) if oral, a summary thereof
(including the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal).
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis
of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal and with respect to
any change to the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal within
twenty-four (24) hours of any such change. The Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any contract, arrangement, or
commitment with any Third Party subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or shall become party to
any contract, arrangement, or commitment, in each case, that prohibits the
Company from providing such information to Parent.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors
of the Company may (i) (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect
of an Acquisition Proposal, or (y) enter into an agreement providing for a
transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal, if (A) the Company shall
have received an Acquisition Proposal that was not the result of a breach of
Section 6.04(a) that the Board of Directors of the Company determines, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company shall have
otherwise complied in all material respects with the provisions of Section
6.04, (B) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
action with respect to such Superior Proposal would likely be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (C) the Company has previously
notified Parent in writing that it intends to take such action (a "Section
6.04 Notice"), (D) the Company shall have made its Representatives available
to discuss in good faith with Parents Representatives any proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the three
(3) Business Day period following delivery by the Company to Parent of the
Section 6.04 Notice delivered to Parent, (E) if Parent shall have delivered to
the Company a written, binding and irrevocable offer capable of being
accepted by the Company to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement
during such three (3) Business Day period, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors), after considering the
terms of such offer by Parent, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to such
Section 6.04 Notice continues to be a Superior Proposal, and (F) in the case
of clause (y) above, the Company terminates this Agreement in accordance with

 



47  Section 10.01(d)(i), or (ii) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change other
than in respect of an Acquisition Proposal if (A) the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to effect such Adverse Recommendation Change would
likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (B) the
Company has previously delivered to Parent a Section 6.04 Notice that it
intends to take such action, (C) the Company shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss in good faith with Parents
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement during the three (3) Business Day period following delivery by
the Company to Parent of the Section 6.04 Notice delivered to Parent, and (D)
if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written, binding and
irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms
or conditions of this Agreement during such three (3) Business Day period, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and after considering the terms
of such offer by Parent, that the failure to effect such Adverse
Recommendation Change would likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. If any Superior Proposal that is the subject of clause
(i) of this Section 6.04(e) is revised, including any revision to price, then
the Company shall deliver to Parent a new Section 6.04 Notice and again comply
with the requirements of clause (i) of this Section 6.04(e) with respect to
such revised Superior Proposal, on each occasion on which a revised Superior
Proposal is submitted, _provided_ that in connection with each new Section
6.04 Notice contemplated by this sentence, each reference to a three (3)
Business Day period in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a
reference to the longer of (x) a forty-eight (48) hour period or (y) a period
ending on 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on the Business Day following delivery
of the applicable Section 6.04 Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, all
information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.04 or Section 6.03
will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(f) As used in this Agreement:

 

(i) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement
(A) in effect on the date hereof or (B) that (x) contains provisions that are
no less favorable in any material respect to the Company than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) does not include a provision calling
for an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and does not restrict
the Company in any way from complying with this Agreement, including
prohibiting the Company from providing information or written materials to
Parent; _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement may contain a less
restrictive or no standstill restriction.

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal
(with all references to 20% and 80% in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
being treated as references to 50% for these purposes) on terms that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) by a majority vote, taking
into account (A) any proposal by Parent to amend or modify the terms of this
Agreement and (B) all reasonably available legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, are more favorable to the Companys
stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the Merger.

 



48 __Section 6.05. _No Control of the Company s Operations_. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give to Parent, directly or indirectly, rights to
control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, subject to and consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control of its
business and operations (it being understood that this provision shall not
limit the rights of any party under Section 11.14 with respect to enforcement
of the provisions of this Agreement). __

ARTICLE 7

COVENANTS OF PARENT

Parent agrees that:

Section 7.01. _Conduct of Parent_. Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
knowingly take any action or fail to take any action that would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the financing thereof; _provided_ , that this Section 7.01 shall not apply to
any Specified Acquisitions (as defined in Section 8.01(b)), regardless of
whether such Specified Acquisitions take place before or after the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 9.01(c).

Section 7.02. _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

Section 7.03. _Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Subsidiary_.
Immediately following the execution of this Agreement by the parties, Parent,
as sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, shall approve and adopt this
Agreement, in accordance with Delaware Law, by written consent, and promptly
deliver to the Company a correct and complete copy of such written consent,
certified by the Secretary of Parent.

Section 7.04.  _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote all shares of Company
Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption
of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

Section 7.05. _Director and Officer Liability_.

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is as of the
date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a former
or present officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, an "Indemnified Person") to

 



49  the fullest extent (and solely to such extent) that the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary (as applicable) would have been permitted by the
Applicable Law of its jurisdiction of organization and under its certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) in effect
on the date hereof to indemnify its own present and former officers and
directors against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines
and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with any threatened
or pending claim, action, suit or proceeding to which the Indemnified Person
is made a party, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
whether formal or informal (each, a "Proceeding"), arising out of or
pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was an officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the
request of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary as an officer, director,
employee, fiduciary or agent of another enterprise, (ii) acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or (iii) this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case whether asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time. In the event of any such Proceeding, to
the fullest extent (and solely to such extent) that the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary (as applicable) would have been permitted under the
Applicable Law of its jurisdiction of organization and under its certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) to
advance such fees, costs and expenses to such Indemnified Person, in each
case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, each Indemnified Person will
be entitled to advancement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with
any such Proceeding within twenty Business Days of receipt by the
Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Person of a request therefor,
_provided_ that, any person to whom expenses are advanced has provided an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by final
adjudication that such person is not entitled to indemnification. In the
event any Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Person in which
indemnification or advancement of expenses could be sought by such Indemnified
Person under this Section 7.05(a), (A) the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, _provided_
that the Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any such Proceeding, unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Person from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Indemnified
Person otherwise consents, and (B) the Indemnified Persons as a group
may retain only one law firm to represent them with respect to each such
matter described in this Section 7.05(a) unless there is, under applicable
standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between
the positions of any two or more Indemnified Persons. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the
payment and performance obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 7.05(a). For the avoidance of doubt, if an Indemnified Person
initiates a Proceeding against the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Affiliates to enforce the provisions of this Section 7.05(a) and a judgment or
order is rendered in favor of such Indemnified Person in connection
therewith, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify such Indemnified Person
for all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in connection with such Proceeding to the
fullest extent permitted herein, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational
documents) of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company (as
applicable).

 



50 (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time to, obtain a fully paid non-cancellable extension of the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier(s) with respect to DandO Insurance and with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in
such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions
contemplated hereby) ("Tail Insurance"), _provided_ that in no event shall the
cost of any such Tail Insurance in respect of any one policy year exceed the
Maximum Amount; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the cost of any such Tail
Insurance in respect of any one policy year exceeds the Maximum Amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain policies of DandO Insurance
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Amount. The
Company shall cooperate and consult with Parent reasonably and in good faith
in seeking to obtain Tail Insurance hereunder, it being understood and agreed
that nothing herein shall restrict the ability of the Company to obtain Tail
Insurance prior to the Closing in the manner contemplated by the preceding
sentence. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to
obtain such Tail Insurance as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to
maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the
Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase from the Companys current insurance carrier or
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance comparable
DandO 

 



51  Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
coverage pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300%
of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year (the
"Maximum Amount"), which amount is set forth in Section 7.05(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain policies of DandO Insurance with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Amount. 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.05.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.05 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or any other Applicable
Law or under any agreement of such Person with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and
are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

Section 7.06. _Employee Matters_.

(a) For a period starting at the Closing and ending on December 31, 2014,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to, provide to each Company Employee who is employed immediately
prior to the Closing and who remains in the employ of Parent, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing (each such individual, a "Continuing
Employee") (i) a level of base salary and hourly wages that is no less
favorable than the level of base salary and hourly wages that such Continuing
Employee received immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) commissions, bonus
opportunities and employee benefits (other than equity-based plans) that are,
in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the level of such commissions,
bonus opportunities, and employee benefits provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) For a period of 24 months following the Closing, Parent shall maintain the
employee severance protections set forth in Section 7.06(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

 



52 (c) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries) to, cause any employee benefit plans established,
maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its Affiliates that cover any
of the Continuing Employees following the Closing (collectively, the "Parent
Plans") to (i) recognize the pre-Closing service of participating Continuing
Employees with the Company for all purposes of vesting, eligibility and
benefit entitlement, _provided_ that service with the Company shall not be
counted for purposes of (x) benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan of
Parent, (y) eligibility for any retiree welfare benefits of Parent, or (z) to
the extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for
the same period, (ii) waive any pre-existing condition limitations for
participating Continuing Employees and (iii) provide credit to each
participating Continuing Employee under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts
paid by the Continuing Employee prior to the Closing during the year in which
the Closing occurs under any analogous Company Employee Plan during the same
period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms of
such Parent Plan.

(d) Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to continue to
credit under any applicable Parent Plans each Continuing Employee for all
vacation and personal holiday pay that such Continuing Employee is entitled to
use but has not used as of the Closing, subject to maximum carryover
limitations, if any, under Parents vacation policy.

(e) Nothing in this Section 7.06, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person, including any Continuing Employee, any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, and no provision of this Section 7.06 shall constitute an amendment
of, or an undertaking to amend, any Company Employee Plan or Parent Plan.

by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, any sale, divestiture,
license, disposition, prohibition or limitation or other action of a type
described in Section 8.01(c) or Section 8.01(d), with respect to any assets or

Effective Time, the Company or its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation

their respective Representatives to, reasonably cooperate as requested by
Parent in connection with any such sale, divestiture, license, disposition,
prohibition or limitation or other action of a type described in Section

and participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the

competition or antitrust matters in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger.

Parent shall cooperate with one another (a) in determining whether any action
by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required,

reasonable actions or making any such filings, furnishing information required
in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such reasonable
actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 



55 Section 8.03. _Parent Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
obtain the Financing, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Amended Credit Agreement and the commitments provided
for thereunder, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions precedent
to drawing down funds set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement in connection
with the Financing and (iii) in the event that all conditions in the Amended
Credit Agreement have been satisfied, consummate the Financing at or prior to
Closing. In addition, from and after the date hereof, Parent shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, draw down proceeds under the
Amended Credit Facility or reduce the commitments thereunder to the extent
that, after giving effect to such draw down or reduction, the remaining
amounts available to be drawn down by Parent under the Amended Credit Facility
(together with any immediately available funds then available, and which will
be available at the Closing, to Parent) would not be sufficient to fund the
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and all other amounts required
to be paid pursuant to Article 2 and all related fees and expenses of Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and their respective Representatives pursuant to
this Agreement that are required to be paid in connection with the Closing.
After the date hereof until the Closing, Parent shall not agree to any
amendment or modification to be made to, or to any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Amended Credit Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Company if such amendments, modifications or waivers would reasonably
be expected to (w) reduce the aggregate amount of funds or commitments
available to Parent under the Amended Credit Facility below the amount
required to consummate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement and pay
all related fees and expenses required to be paid in connection with the
Closing, (x) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the drawdown of
funds pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement or (y) prevent, impede or
materially delay the availability of the Financing. Upon any amendment,
supplement or modification of or waiver to the Amended Credit Agreement in
accordance with this Section 8.03, Parent shall provide a copy thereof to the
Company and the term "Amended Credit Agreement" shall mean the Amended Credit
Agreement as so amended, supplemented, modified or waived (it being understood
that delivery of any document (to the extent any such document is included in
materials otherwise filed with the SEC) required to be delivered pursuant to
this Section 8.03 may be satisfied with respect to such document by the filing
of Parents Form 10-K or 10-Q or 8-K, as applicable, with the SEC, it being
understood that any such documents shall be deemed to have been delivered to
the Company on the later of the date (A) such documents are posted on the
SECs website on the Internet at www.sec.gov and (B) on which Parent provides
notice of such posting to the Company).

(b) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give the Company prompt notice if
Parent gains knowledge: (i) of any "Event of Default" under the Amended Credit
Agreement (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Event of
Default) that would

 



56  reasonably be expected to adversely affect the amount or availability of the
Financing; (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any lender party to the Amended Credit Agreement with
respect to any actual or threatened breach, default, withdrawal, termination
or repudiation by any lender party to the Amended Credit Agreement of any
provisions of the Amended Credit Agreement; and (iii) of any material written
dispute or disagreement between or among Parent and any of the other lender
parties to the Amended Credit Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
reduce the amount of the Financing or prevent, impede or materially delay
the availability of the Financing.

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
the Financing, or any other financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirm their obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing
or any other financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article 9\.

__Section 8.04. _Public Announcements_. Except in connection with actions
taken pursuant to Section 6.04, Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release, having any communication with the
press (whether or not for attribution), making any other public statement or
scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and,
except in respect of any public statement or press release as may be required
by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national
securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press release or
make any such other public statement or schedule any such press conference or
conference call before such consultation. __

officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in

(d) (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which would cause ((A) any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement made by it (and in the case of Parent, made by Merger
Subsidiary) to be untrue or inaccurate in a manner that would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.03(a), as
applicable, not to be satisfied or (B) any covenant, condition or agreement
contained in this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied by it (and in
the case of Parent, by Merger Subsidiary) in a manner that would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 9.02(b) or Section 9.03(b), as applicable,
not to be satisfied and (ii) in the case of the Company, any change or
development that has, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company

change or development that has, or would reasonably be expected to have, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality agreement relating
to an Acquisition Proposal, or any standstill agreement to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (other than any between the Company and
Parent), in each case unless the Board of Directors of the Company determines
after consulting with its outside legal counsel that the failure to
terminate, amend, modify or waive such provision would likely be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company
shall not enforce and hereby waives any provision of any such agreement that
would prohibit a third party from requesting such termination, amendment,
modification or waiver or from communicating confidentially an Acquisition
Proposal to the Companys Board of Directors. Subject to the foregoing,
during such period, the Company agrees to enforce the provisions of any such
agreements, including, if applicable, seeking to obtain injunctions to prevent
any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in any court of the U.S. or any state thereof having

contemplated hereby. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to
settle any litigation or other legal proceeding against the  __Company or any
of its directors, officers, employees, advisors or agents, by any stockholder
of the Company or otherwise, relating to this Agreement or the Merger without

effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement, or the
transactions provided for in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 10

TERMINATION

Section 10.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or
after the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval ( _provided_ , that any
termination pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i) or Section 10.01(d)(i) may only
occur prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval):

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

 

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before December 31, 2013 (the
"End Date");  _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 10.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party (including, in
the case of Parent, Merger Subsidiary) whose breach of any provision of this
Agreement results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such
time; _provided_ , _further_ , that if, as of the End Date, (x) one or more of
the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(b) (due solely to any Regulatory Law
applicable to the 

 



61  Merger or any Prohibition under or in respect of any Regulatory Law
applicable to the Merger) or Section 9.01(c) are not then satisfied, and (y)
all of the other conditions set forth in Section 9.01 and the condition set
forth in Section 9.02(c) are satisfied, other than those conditions that by
their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing, _provided_ that such
conditions are then capable of being satisfied (it being understood that in
determining whether the condition set forth in Section 9.02(c) is satisfied
solely for the purposes of this proviso, clause (ii) of the definition of
"Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be interpreted without taking into
account any effect resulting from any Regulatory Law applicable to the Merger
or Prohibition under or in respect of any Regulatory Law applicable to the
Merger), then, upon written notice given by either the Company or Parent
to the other not later than 6:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the End Date, the End
Date shall be extended until April 30, 2014, which date shall thereupon
constitute the End Date for all purposes of this Agreement;

 

(ii) there shall be any permanent injunction or other order issued by any
court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition
preventing the consummation of the Merger and such injunction or other order
shall have become final and nonappealable; or

(iii) at the Company Stockholder Meeting (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof), the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained; or

 

(c) by Parent, if:

(i) (A) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred, (B) the Company
fails to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or
(C) the Company materially and intentionally breaches or fails to perform any
of its obligations under Section 6.04;

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section
9.02(a) or Section 9.02(b) not to be satisfied prior to or as of the End Date
and, in any such case, such breach or failure to perform (if curable) has not
been cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach to the Company
by Parent; or

 

(d) by the Company:

(i) prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in order to
concurrently or immediately after enter into a written agreement for an
Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal, if the Company,
concurrently with, and as a condition to, any termination pursuant to this
Section 10.01(d)(i), pays Parent the Termination Fee as set forth in Section
11.04(b)(i); _provided_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 10.01(d)(i) if such Superior Proposal resulted from a
breach by the Company of Section 6.04; or

 



62 (ii) if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform
any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set
forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set
forth in Section 9.03(a) or Section 9.03(b) not to be satisfied prior to or as
of the End Date and, in any such case, such breach or failure to perform (if
curable) has not been cured within 30 days after written notice of such breach
to Parent by the Company.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01
(other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

 

 __Section 10.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other
party hereto; _provided_ that, subject to Section 11.04(c) and Section
11.04(d), if such termination shall result from the willful breach by a party
of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement, such
party shall not be released or relieved from any liabilities or
damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the
extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a partys stockholders
(taking into consideration relevant matters, including other combination
opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be deemed in such
event to be damages of such party) incurred or suffered by the other party as
a result of such failure. The rights granted pursuant to this Section 10.02
to the Company shall be enforceable solely by the Company, in its sole and
absolute discretion, on behalf of the stockholders of the Company and it is
agreed that neither this provision nor any other provision of this Agreement
is intended to provide the stockholders of the Company the ability to seek
prior to the Effective Time the enforcement of, or directly seek any remedies
pursuant to, this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt as to the parties intent
with respect to control of determinations regarding the Companys rights under
this Agreement to terminate, amend, make any waiver or consent under, or
enforce this Agreement, and whether and how (if applicable) to distribute any
damages award to stockholders of the Company, such rights shall exclusively
belong to the Company (acting through the Board of Directors of the Company)
in its sole discretion. The provisions of this Section 10.02, 11.04, 11.08,
11.09 and 11.10 and the last sentence of Section 6.04(e) shall survive any
termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01. __

__Section 11.03. _Amendments and Waivers_. (a) Any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only
if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or

Section 11.04. _Expenses_. (a) _General_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense, whether

(b) _Termination Fee; Expense Reimbursement Amount; Reverse Termination Fee_.
__

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i)
or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay
to Parent in immediately available funds $16,600,000 (the "Termination Fee").
The Termination Fee shall be payable in the case of termination (1) by Parent,
within two Business Days of such termination and (2) by the Company,
concurrently with such termination.

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (x) Section 10.01(b)(i) and
the Company Stockholder Meeting has not been held prior to the date of such
termination, (y) Section 10.01(b)(iii) or (z) Section 10.01(c)(ii) as a
result, in the case of this clause (z) only, of a material breach by the
Company of Section 8.01 or of an intentional breach by the Company of any of
its other obligations hereunder (including an intentional breach by the
Company of its obligation to consummate the Closing pursuant to Section
2.01(b)), and, in the case of any of clauses (x), (y) or (z), (A) at any time
prior to such termination (in the case of the foregoing clause (x) or (z)) or
the Company Stockholder Meeting (in the case of the foregoing clause (y)) an
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced and not publicly and
unconditionally withdrawn at least five Business Days prior

 



65 to the time of such termination (in the case of the foregoing clause (x) or
(z)) or the Company Stockholder Meeting (in the case of the foregoing clause
(y)) and (B) within twelve (12) months following the date of such termination,
either the Company enters into a definitive agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the same Acquisition Proposal
referred to in clause (A) above) or any transaction contemplated by an
Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the same Acquisition Proposal referred
to in clause (A) above) is consummated ( _provided_ that for purposes of this
clause (B), each reference to "20%" and "80%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then the Company shall
pay to Parent, concurrently with the occurrence of the applicable event
described in clause (B), the Termination Fee; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any payment received by Parent pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(iii) shall be
credited against such payment.

(iii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (x) Section 10.01(b)(i) and
the Company Stockholder Meeting has not been held prior to the date of such
termination or (y) Section 10.01(b)(iii), and, in any such case, at any time
prior to such termination (in the case of the foregoing clause (x)) or the
Company Stockholder Meeting (in the case of the foregoing clause (y)) an
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced and not publicly and
unconditionally withdrawn at least five Business Days prior to the time of
such termination (in the case of the foregoing clause (x)) or the Company
Stockholder Meeting (in the case of the foregoing clause (y)), then the
Company shall pay to Parent, within two (2) Business Days of such termination,
the Expense Reimbursement Amount. The term "Expense Reimbursement Amount"
means all documented out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Parent in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including fees and expenses of accountants, attorneys, investment bankers and
financial advisors (but excluding corporate overhead or salaries payable to
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries); _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall the Expense Reimbursement Amount exceed $6,000,000. 

(iv) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) or
Section 10.01(b)(ii) and, at the time of such termination, (x) one or more of
the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(b) (due solely to any Regulatory Law
applicable to the Merger or any Prohibition under or in respect of any
Regulatory Law applicable to the Merger) or Section 9.01(c) are not then
satisfied, and (y) all of the other conditions set forth in Section 9.01 and
Section 9.02 have been satisfied (except those conditions that by their terms
cannot be satisfied until the Closing,  _provided_ that such conditions are
then capable of being satisfied), then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
$30,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee") to the Company. The Reverse
Termination Fee shall be payable within two (2) Business Days following the
termination described in the preceding sentence. In determining whether the
conditions set forth in Section 9.02(a), Section 9.02(c) and Section 9.02(d)
(as Section 9.02(d) relates to Sections 9.02(a) and 9.02(c)) shall have been
satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied, as applicable, solely for
the purposes of this Section 11.04(b)(iv), clause (ii) of the definition of
"Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be interpreted without taking into
account any effect resulting from any Regulatory Law applicable to the Merger
or Prohibition under or in respect of any Regulatory Law applicable to the
Merger.

 



66 (c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that, upon any termination of this
Agreement under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable by the
Company pursuant to Section 11.04(b) and such Termination Fee is paid in full,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be precluded from any other remedy against
the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any
kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or
Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In no event shall
the Company be required to pay more than one Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 11.04(b).

(d) The Company agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where the Reverse Termination Fee is payable by Parent pursuant
to Section 11.04(b) and such Reverse Termination Fee is paid in full, the
Company, its Subsidiaries, Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives (the
"Company Related Parties") shall be precluded from any other remedy against
Parent, Merger Subsidiary, and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
stockholders and Representatives (including the Financing Sources) (the
"Parent Related Parties"), at law or in equity or otherwise, and none of the
Company Related Parties shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or
damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages,
against any of the Parent Related Parties or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or
Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not limit the Companys ability to enforce its rights under
the Confidentiality Agreement. In no event shall Parent be required to pay
more than one Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section 11.04(b).

(e) The Termination Fee, the Expense Reimbursement Amount and the Reverse
Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 11.04(b) shall be made by wire
transfer of same day funds. The parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in Section 11.04(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, none of
the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary would enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if (i) the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due by the
Company pursuant to Section 11.04(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or Merger Subsidiary commences a suit which results in a binding
nonappealable judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction against
the Company for the fee set forth in Section 11.04(b), the Company shall pay
to Parent or Merger Subsidiary its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, and (ii) Parent fails to promptly pay the
amount due by Parent pursuant to Section 11.04(b), and, in order to obtain
such payment, the Company commences a suit which results in a binding
nonappealable judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction against
Parent or Merger Subsidiary for the fee set forth in Section 11.04(b), 

 



67  Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Parent or the Company
fails to promptly pay the amount due by such party pursuant to Section
11.04(b), interest shall accrue on such amount from the date such payment was
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date of
payment at a rate per annum equal to three (3) percent plus the prime
interest rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such interest
begins accruing.

__Section 11.05. _Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References_. The
parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a)
the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this
Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties of such party that
are contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference
as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties is reasonably apparent. The mere inclusion of an item in either the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception
to, or disclosure for purposes of, a representation or warranty shall not be
deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material
fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable, or is outside of the ordinary course of
business of the Company. __

__Section 11.06. _ Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) The provisions
of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and no provision
of this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, other
than: (i) with respect to the provisions of Section 7.05 which shall inure to
the benefit of the persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are intended
to be third-party beneficiaries thereof, (ii) at and after the Effective Time,
the rights of the holders of shares of Company Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
(iii) at and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Company
Option Awards and Company Restricted Stock Awards to receive the payments
contemplated by the applicable provisions of Section 2.05, in each case, at
the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and (iv) with respect to the proviso of the first sentence
of Section 8.08, which shall inure to the benefit of each Person that is a
party to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Company. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. __

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent and Merger Subsidiary may assign all or any of
their rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Subsidiaries
of Parent, _provided_ that no such

 



68  assignment shall (i) relieve the assigning party of its obligations under
this Agreement, (ii) enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other
party hereto or due to such assigning party or (iii) be permitted if such
assignment would reasonably be expected to prevent, impair or delay the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 __Section 11.07. _No Other Representations and Warranties_. (a) Except for
the representations and warranties set forth in Article 4, each of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that no representation or warranty
of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, at law or in equity, is made or
shall be deemed to have been made by or on behalf of the Company to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, and the Company hereby disclaims, and Parent and Merger
Subsidiary hereby disclaim any reliance upon, any such representation or
warranty, whether by or on behalf of the Company, and notwithstanding
the delivery or disclosure to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, or any of their
Representatives or Affiliates, of any documentation or other information by
the Company or any of its Representatives or Affiliates with respect to any
one or more of the foregoing. In particular, without limiting the foregoing
disclaimer, neither the Company nor any other Person makes or has made any
representation or warranty to Parent, Merger Subsidiary, or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby
disclaim any reliance upon, any representation or warranty with respect to any
financial projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospect information
relating to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses. __

(b) Except for the representations and warranties set forth in Article 5, the
Company acknowledges and agrees that no representation or warranty of any
kind whatsoever, express or implied, at law or in equity, is made or shall be
deemed to have been made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, and
Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby disclaim, and the Company hereby disclaim
any reliance upon, any such representation or warranty, whether by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, and notwithstanding the delivery or
disclosure to the Company, or any of their Representatives or Affiliates of
any documentation or other information by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any
of their respective Representatives or Affiliates with respect to any one or
more of the foregoing.

 

 __Section 11.08. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state. __

Section 11.09. _Jurisdiction_. (a) The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in
the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or

 



69  proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
