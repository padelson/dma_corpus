iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), is made and entered
into as of September 14, 2011 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), by and among (i)
Teradyne, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (" _Parent_ "), (ii) Lager
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary (as
hereinafter defined) of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), (iii) LitePoint
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and (iv) Michael
Goguen, acting in his capacity as Stockholder Representative (the "
_Stockholder Representative_ ").

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement and
in accordance with the provisions of Delaware Law, Merger Sub shall merge with
and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), following which the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(the surviving corporation is referred to herein as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ");

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
approved and adopted this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and will be submitting the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance of the transaction contemplated
hereby to the holders of the shares of the capital stock of the Company
(collectively, the " _Company Stockholders_ "), for their approval and
adoption by written consent in accordance with Delaware Law and the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company;

WHEREAS, the Company Board has carefully considered the terms of this
Agreement and has determined that the terms and conditions of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are fair and in the best interests
of, and are advisable to, the Company and the Company Stockholders, and the
Company Board recommends that the Company Stockholders vote for the approval
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, this Agreement has been approved by each of the board of directors
of Merger Sub and the board of directors of Parent; and

WHEREAS, as an inducement for Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, certain Company Stockholders have entered into Non-Competition and
Non-Solicitation Agreements with Parent, such agreements to be effective as of
the Closing Date (the " _Non-Competition Agreements_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements herein contained and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and Stockholder Representative hereby agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including those set forth in Article 7 hereof, the Merger shall be
consummated under the following circumstances: (a) _The Merger_. Upon the terms hereof and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and in accordance with Delaware Law, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and, as a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Consummation of the Merger; Effective Time_. Subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of all of the conditions contained in Article 7, as
soon as is reasonably practicable, but in no event later than on the later of
(i) the third (3rd) business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all
of the conditions contained in Article 7, other than those conditions which
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, (ii) the fifth (5th) day
following the Companys delivery of an updated Company Disclosure Schedule
pursuant to Article 3, if any, and (iii) such later date as may be mutually
agreed upon by the Company and Parent, a closing (the " _Closing_ ") will be
held at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP at 140 Scott Drive, Menlo Park,
California 94025 (or such other place as the parties may agree). The date on
which the Closing is actually held is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_." On the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger, substantially
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Merger Certificate_ ")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The term "
_Effective Time_ " means the date and time of the filing of the Merger
Certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or such
later time as may be agreed by each of the parties hereto and specified in the
Merger Certificate in accordance with Delaware Law). In the event of a
conflict between this Agreement and the Merger Certificate, this Agreement
shall govern.

1.2 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the Merger Certificate and as
provided by the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, upon the consummation of the
Merger, all the property (including, but not limited to, Intellectual Property
and licenses to Intellectual Property), rights, privileges and powers of the
Company and the Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each
of those corporations shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

1.3 _Charter; Bylaws_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, unless otherwise determined by Parent and the
Company prior to the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Charter_ "), shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, as amended by the Merger Certificate.

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_Surviving Corporation Bylaws_ "), shall be the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as
provided by Delaware Law, the Surviving Corporation Charter and such bylaws.

 



2 1.4 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Surviving Corporation
Charter and the Surviving Corporation Bylaws, and until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death,
disability, resignation or removal. The officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, disability,
resignation or removal.

1.5  _Capitalization and Closing Payment Amount Certificate; Closing Payment;
Closing Escrow Amount; Representative Reimbursement Amount_.

(a) _Capitalization and Closing Payment Amount Certificate_. No later than the
third (3rd) business day prior to the Closing, the Company shall prepare and
deliver to Parent a certificate of the Company executed on its behalf by each
of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company
(the " _Capitalization and Closing Payment Amount Certificate_ "), that sets
forth (x) the information required to be set forth on _Section 3.3(e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ (Capitalization), as of the Effective Time, and
(y) the Companys best good faith estimates of each of: (i) the respective
amounts of all unpaid (A) third party fees, costs or expenses incurred or
expected to be incurred by the Company (or for which the Company will be
responsible) in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, any fees and expenses of
legal counsel, financial advisors and consultants, the cost of the Tail DandO
Policy, and the costs of establishing and maintaining an online virtual data
room to facilitate Parents due diligence review of the Company), whether or
not invoiced or billed prior to the Effective Time and whether incurred on
behalf of the Company or on behalf of the Participating Rights Holders, and
(B) bonuses, severance or other transaction-related payments to be paid to any
director, officer or employee of the Company in connection with the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any payroll
taxes incurred or to be incurred by the Company in connection therewith
(collectively, the " _Transaction Costs_ "), (ii) the amount (the "
_Indebtedness Amount_ ") that would be required to fully discharge, as of
the Effective Time, any Indebtedness for Borrowed Money expected by the
Company to be outstanding at the Effective Time, (iii) the aggregate amount of
cash, or cash equivalents, short term and long term marketable securities and
related interest receivables expected by the Company to be held by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, determined in accordance with
GAAP, _provided_ , that such amount shall be reduced in any event by any
amounts necessary to satisfy any checks-in-transit and overdrafts of the
Company and increased in any event by any deposits-in-transit (such net
amount, the " _Cash On-Hand Amount_ "), (iv) any rebates owed to the Companys
largest customer, based on the net sales for the six months ended June 30,
2011, as reflected in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2011 included in the
Closing Financials and owed as of the Effective Time, and the aggregate amount
of all accounts payable and similar payment obligations and liabilities of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding accrued liabilities and any
amounts included in the Transactions Costs or Indebtedness Amount) that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time are more than 90 days past due other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices
(collectively, the " _Overdue Payables Amount_ "), (v) any unpaid amount
payable in respect to that certain Manufacturing Services Agreement, dated as
of May 26, 2005, by and between the Company

 



3  and Sanmina-SCI Corporation (" _Sanmina_ "), solely to the extent Sanmina
requests that the Company issue an order to Sanmina for excess and obsolete
components prior to or within 30 days following the Closing Date (the "
_Sanmina Payable Amount_ "), unless Parent has communicated with Sanmina in an
effort to cause Sanmina to request payment, (vi) any unpaid amount of the
$535,000 due pursuant to that certain Limited Use Tools Agreement, dated as
of July 27, 2011, by and between the Company and Qualcomm Incorporated, as of
the Effective Time (the " _Qualcomm Payable Amount_ "), (vii) the aggregate
amount of exercise prices for Company Options that are outstanding and
unexercised as of the Effective Time (but only to the extent vested and
exercisable as of the Effective Time), and which shall be disposed of as of
the Effective Time in accordance with  _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ (the " _Strike
Price Amount_ "), (viii) the aggregate amounts received by the Company during
the period between the Agreement Date and the Closing Date with respect to
outstanding accounts receivable collected by the Company other than in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with their express payment terms or in
a substantially similar manner as past practice (collectively, the "
_Accelerated Receipts Amount_ "), and (ix) the Companys calculation of the
Closing Payment Amount in accordance with the information set forth on the
Capitalization and Closing Payment Amount Certificate. During the period from
and including the Agreement Date and prior to the Closing, the Company shall
provide Parent with full access to the Companys books of account and records
used to prepare the Capitalization and Closing Payment Amount Certificate, and
the management of the Company, for the purpose of verifying the amounts set
forth therein. The disclosures set forth on the Capitalization and Closing
Payment Amount Certificate shall be deemed to be representations and
warranties of the Company hereunder.

 

(b) _Closing Payment; Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit; Closing Escrow Amount_. At
the Closing, Parent shall be required to pay to each of the Participating
Rights Holders the portion of the Closing Payment Amount (the aggregate of
such payments, the " _Closing Payment_ "), and the Estimated Deemed Tax
Benefit allocated to such Participating Rights Holder pursuant to  _Section
2.1_; _provided_ that (i) a portion of the Closing Payment equal to $300,000
(the " _Representative Reimbursement Amount_ ") shall not be paid to the
Participating Rights Holders but shall instead be deposited with the
Stockholder Representative to be held by the Stockholder Representative for
the payment of expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in
performing his duties pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
and subject to disbursement pursuant to _Section 2.5(f),_ and a portion of
the Closing Payment equal to the Closing Escrow Amount shall not be paid to
the Participating Rights Holders but shall instead be deposited with Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), to be held by the Escrow Agent on
behalf of the Participating Rights Holders pursuant to an Escrow Agreement,
substantially in the form of the attached _Exhibit B_ (the "
_Escrow Agreement_ "), to be entered into at the Closing, by and among
Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent, and (ii) the
portion of the Closing Payment Amount allocated to each Participating Rights
Holder that shall not be paid to such Participating Rights Holder and shall
instead be contributed to the Representative Reimbursement Amount and Closing
Escrow Amount pursuant to the preceding clause (i), shall be _pro rata_ based
on the number of shares of Company Capital Stock that such Participating
Rights Holder holds (assuming the exercise in full of all vested Company
Options). The Closing Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent and
distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. Beneficial interests in each of Representative Reimbursement Amount
and the Closing Escrow Amount shall be allocated

 



4  among the Participating Rights Holders on a pro _rata basis_ , based on the
respective amounts initially deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to this
paragraph (b).

 

(c) _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

(i) (A) Within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall
prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative its calculation of the
Closing Payment Amount, including the various elements thereof (the " _Parent
Closing Payment Calculation_ "), which may include an adjustment pursuant to
clause (v) thereof if the Sanmina Payable Amount is requested on or prior to
such date. If Parent does not deliver to the Stockholder Representative the
Parent Closing Payment Calculation within such 30-day period, then the Closing
Payment Amount set forth in the Capitalization and Closing Payment Amount
Certificate shall be deemed to be the Settled Closing Payment Amount for
purposes of _Section 1.5(c)(iv)_ below.

(ii) The Stockholder Representative shall have a period of thirty (30) days
(the " _Objection Period_ ") after delivery of the Parent Closing Payment
Calculation, in which to provide written notice to Parent of any objections
thereto (the " _Objection Notice_ "). Such Objection Notice shall set forth
in reasonable detail the specific items set forth on the Parent Closing
Payment Calculation to which each such objection relates and the specific
basis for each such objection. If the Stockholder Representative does not
give such Objection Notice within the Objection Period, then the Closing
Payment Amount set forth in the Parent Closing Payment Calculation shall be
deemed to be the Settled Closing Payment Amount for purposes of _Section
1.5(c)(iv)_ below. If the Stockholder Representative gives such Objection
Notice within the Objection Period, then the Stockholder Representative and
Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute concerning the
item(s) subject to such Objection Notice. If the Stockholder Representative
and Parent do not resolve any dispute arising in connection with the Parent
Closing Payment Calculation within thirty (30) days after the date of delivery
of the Objection Notice, which 30 day period may be extended by written
agreement of Parent and the Stockholder Representative (such period, as it may
be extended, the " _Initial Resolution Period_ "), such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in  _Section
1.5(c)(iii)_ below. During the Objection Period, Parent shall provide the
Stockholder Representative, or his agents, with reasonable access to the books
of account and records of the Company and the Surviving Corporation used
to prepare the Parent Closing Payment Calculations, and the management of the
Surviving Corporation and the controller and other employees of Parent who
were involved in the calculation of the Closing Payment Amount, for the
purpose of verifying the amounts set forth therein.

(iii) If Parent and the Stockholder Representative have not been able to
resolve a dispute arising in connection with the Parent Closing Payment
Calculation within the Initial Resolution Period, either party may submit such
dispute to, and such dispute shall be resolved fully, finally and exclusively
through the use of a mutually agreeable independent accounting firm (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ "). The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm incurred in the resolution of such dispute shall be borne by
the parties in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the Participating Rights Holders and Parent from the
resolution of the dispute. For example, if the Stockholder Representative
challenges the calculation of the Closing Payment Amount in the 

 



5  Parent Closing Payment Calculation by an amount of $100,000, but the
Independent Accounting Firm determines that the Participating Rights Holders
have a valid claim for only $40,000, Parent shall bear 40% of the fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and the Stockholder Representative
shall bear the other 60% of such fees and expenses. Any dispute resolution
proceeding shall be commenced within thirty (30) days after the expiration of
the Initial Resolution Period. The Independent Accounting Firm shall determine
(and written notice thereof shall be given to the Stockholder Representative
and Parent) as promptly as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60)
days following its appointment, based solely on written submissions detailing
the disputed items submitted to it by both parties, only (x) whether the
calculation of the Closing Payment Amount in the Parent Closing Payment
Calculation was prepared in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and
(y) with respect to the disputed items submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm, whether and to what extent (if any) the Capitalization and Closing
Payment Amount Certificate, the Parent Closing Payment Calculation or the
Closing Payment Amount actually paid at Closing require adjustment together
with a written explanation in reasonable detail of each such required
adjustment, including the basis therefor, and the Independent Accounting Firm
shall make no other determinations or calculations. All negotiations pursuant
to this _Section 1.5(c)(iii)_ shall be treated as compromise and settlement
negotiations for purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and
comparable other Laws including state rules of evidence, and all negotiations,
submissions to the Independent Accounting Firm, and dispute resolution
proceedings under this _Section 1.5(c)(iii)_ shall be treated
as confidential information. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be bound
by a mutually agreeable confidentiality agreement. The procedures of this
_Section 1.5(c)(iii)_ are exclusive and, except as set forth below, the
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding
on the parties. The decision rendered pursuant to this _Section 1.5(c)(iii)_
may be filed as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either
party may seek specific enforcement or take other necessary legal action to
enforce any decision under this _Section 1.5(c)(iii)_. The other partys only
defense to such a request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall
be fraud by or upon the Independent Accounting Firm. Absent such fraud, such
other party shall reimburse the party seeking enforcement for its expenses
related to such enforcement.

(iv) Promptly after the calculation of the Closing Payment Amount becomes
final and binding on the parties in accordance with either of subsections (i),
(ii) or (iii) of this  _Section 1.5(c)_ (such amount, the " _Settled Closing
Payment Amount_ "), the parties shall proceed as set forth in this _Section
1.5(c)(iv)_. In the event that the Closing Payment Amount set forth in
the Capitalization and Closing Payment Amount Certificate is greater than the
Settled Closing Payment Amount, Parent, as its sole and exclusive remedy,
shall be entitled to recover from the Escrowed Funds, or by set-off (i.e.,
reduction) of any Contingent Payments otherwise due to the Participating
Rights Holders, an amount equal to the sum of (i) such excess, and (ii) an
amount equal to the Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit _minus_ the Adjusted Deemed
Tax Benefit (as recalculated upon the determination of the Settled Closing
Payment Amount), with any such recovery being referenced hereinafter as a "
_Parent True-Up Recovery_ ," _provided_ that Parent shall be entitled to make
a set-off against any Contingent Payment pursuant to this _Section
1.5(c)(iv)_ with respect to (a) the Closing Payment Amount only if the
recoverable amount is in excess of $2,000,000, and then only in the amount of
such excess, with the first $2,000,000 being recovered from any remaining
Escrowed Funds not otherwise subject to a pending Indemnification Claim and
(b) the Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit only if the

 



6  recoverable amount is in excess of $2,000,000, and then only in the amount
of such excess, with the first $2,000,000 being recovered from any remaining
Escrowed Funds not otherwise subject to a pending Indemnification Claim. If
the Settled Closing Payment Amount is greater than the Closing Payment Amount
set forth in the Capitalization and Closing Payment Amount Certificate, Parent
shall, within ten (10) days after the determination of the Settled Closing
Payment Amount, cause the Paying Agent to make an additional payment to the
Participating Rights Holders in accordance with and subject to the exchange
provisions set forth in _Section 2.2_, _pro rata_ based on the number of
shares of Company Capital Stock that such Participating Rights Holder held at
the Effective Time (assuming the exercise in full of all vested Company
Options), in an amount equal to the sum of (x) such excess, and (y) an amount
equal to the Adjusted Deemed Tax Benefit _minus_ the Estimated Deemed Tax
Benefit (such payment, a " _Parent True-Up Payment_ "). In addition, to the
extent the Settled Closing Payment Amount and Adjusted Deemed Tax Benefit is
greater or less than the Closing Payment Amount or Estimated Deemed Tax
Benefit, respectively, the Escrow Amount shall be reduced or increased in
proportion to any such excess or deficit as follows: (i) upon delivery of any
Parent True-Up Recovery to Parent (either through a distribution from the
Escrowed Funds, or set off from a Contingent Payment) a portion of the
remaining Escrow Funds equal to twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of the
amount of such Parent True-Up Recovery shall be distributed to the
Participating Rights Holders from the Escrowed Funds; and (ii) a portion of
any Parent True-Up Payment equal to twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of
such Parent True-Up Payment shall not be paid to the Participating Rights
Holders but shall instead be deposited with the Escrow Agent as additional
Escrowed Funds.

(v) Subject to _Section 6.12(a)_ (cooperation with respect to tax matters),
prior to the filing by the Surviving Corporation of the federal and state
income Tax Returns for the Tax period beginning on January 1, 2011 that
includes the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver a copy of each such Tax
Return to the Stockholder Representative. In connection with the delivery of
such Tax Return, Parent shall also deliver a calculation of the Deemed
Compensation Deduction and the Deemed Tax Benefit determined by reference to
such Tax Return. The Stockholder Representative shall have a period of thirty
(30) days in which to provide written notice to Parent of any objections
thereto in a manner consistent with the process set forth in paragraph (ii)
above. Any dispute shall be resolved consistent with the process set forth in
paragraphs (ii) and (iii) as though such dispute were a dispute related to the
Parent Closing Payment Calculation. To the extent the Adjusted Deemed Tax
Benefit exceeds the aggregate Deemed Tax Benefit as finally determined for all
such Tax Returns shown in Parents calculation (following resolution of any
dispute), Parent shall be entitled to recover from the Escrowed Funds, or as
a set-off from any Contingent Payment otherwise due to the Participating
Rights Holders, an amount equal to such excess, _provided_ that Parent shall
be entitled to make a set-off against any Contingent Payment pursuant to
this  _Section 1.5(c)(v)_ with respect to Adjusted Deemed Tax Benefit only
if the recoverable amount is in excess of $2,000,000, including any amounts
recovered under _Section 1.5(c)(iv)(b)_, and then only in the amount of such
excess, with the first $2,000,000 being recovered from any remaining Escrowed
Funds not otherwise subject to a pending Indemnification Claim. To the extent
the aggregate Deemed Tax Benefit for all such Tax Returns shown in Parents
calculation (following resolution of any dispute) exceeds the Adjusted Deemed
Tax Benefit, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to, within ten (10) days
after final determination of the Deemed Tax Benefit, make an additional 

 



7  payment to the Participating Rights Holders in an amount equal to such
excess, in accordance with and subject to the exchange provisions set forth in
_Section 2.2_.

 

1.6 _Additional Payments_.

(a) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term:

 

" _Cellular Earn-Out Amount_ " means, with respect to an Earn-Out Payment
Quarter, the amount, if any, equal to (x) the aggregate Cellular Earn-Out

" _Earn-Out Payment Quarter_ " means each of the fiscal quarters of Parent
beginning with the fiscal quarter in which the Effective Time occurs, and
ending with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2012, _provided,_ that
solely with respect to the determination of the Cellular Earn-Out Amount, the
first Earn-Out Payment Quarter ending after the Effective Time shall be deemed
to include the period from and including August 5, 2011 to such quarter end
and as if the Company was the Surviving Corporation (i.e., as if such quarter
began on August 5, 2011).

" _Earn-Out Payment Year_ " means the Parents fiscal year ending December 31,

the amount of any Net Sales for purposes of any Earn-Out Payment Quarter or
Earn-Out Payment Year shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount of
any deferred revenue accretion that would have been included in such Net
Sales, but for the application of purchase accounting in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and _provided_ , 
_further_ , that with respect to the first Earn-Out Quarter ending after the
Effective Time, "Net Sales" shall also include the net sales that would have
been recorded with respect to the Cellular Earn-Out Revenue during such Earn-
Out Quarter in accordance with this definition of "Net Sales" had the
Effective Time occurred on August 5, 2011.

 

" _Revenue Earn-Out Amount_ " means, with respect to an Earn-Out Payment
Quarter, the amount, if any, by which the aggregate Net Sales during the
Earn-Out Payment Year (through the last day of such Earn-Out Payment Quarter),
_exceeds_ the sum of (x) $110,000,000,

 



8   _plus_ (y) the aggregate amount of all Revenue Earn-Out Amounts paid in
respect of all previous Earn-Out Payment Quarters.

 

(b) _Contingent Payments_. As additional consideration for the Merger, but
subject to the set-off rights of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to _Sections 1.5(c)_ and _1.7(d)_ and _Article 9_ (indemnification)
hereof (collectively, the " _Set-off Rights_ "), after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation may be required to make certain
contingent payments (collectively, the " _Contingent Payments_ ") to the
Participating Rights Holders in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 1.6,_ _Section 2.1_ and _Section 6.13_, and subject to the
limitations on such Contingent Payments set forth in this _Section 1.6_. The
Contingent Payments shall include the Revenue Earn-Out Payments and the
Cellular Earn-Out Payments, as applicable, but only to the extent that any of
such payments become payable in accordance with this _Section 1.6_. In the
event the Surviving Corporation does not have the resources to pay any
Contingent Payments then due and payable, then Parent shall satisfy such
payment obligations on behalf of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Revenue Earn-Out Payments_. Subject to the Set-off Rights, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall make a Contingent Payment for each Earn-Out
Payment Quarter beginning with the Earn-Out Payment Quarter ending April 1,
2012 and ending with the Earn-Out Payment Quarter ending December 31,
2012 (each, a " _Revenue Earn-Out Payment_ " and collectively, the " _Revenue
Earn-Out Payments_ "), in accordance with _Section 1.7_, to the extent the
Revenue Earn-Out Amount for such Earn-Out Payment Quarter is equal to an
amount greater than zero (0). The consideration to be paid by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation to the Participating Rights Holders at the time
specified in _Section 1.7_ in connection with each such Revenue Earn-Out
Payment shall be limited to that portion of the Revenue Earn-Out Payment for
such Earn-Out Payment Quarter allocated to such Participating Rights Holders
pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

 

(d) _Cellular Earn-Out Payments_. Subject to the Set-off Rights, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall make a Contingent Payment for each Earn-Out
Payment Quarter beginning with the first Earn-Out Payment Quarter ending after
the Effective Time and ending with the Earn-Out Payment Quarter ending
December 31, 2012 (each, a " _Cellular Earn-Out Payment_ " and collectively,
the " _Cellular Earn-Out Payments_ "), in accordance with _Section 1.7_, to
the extent the Cellular Earn-Out Amount for such Earn-Out Payment Quarter is
equal to an amount greater than zero (0). The consideration to be paid by
Parent and the Surviving Corporation to the Participating Rights Holders at
the time specified in _Section 1.7_ in connection with each such Cellular
Earn-Out Payment shall be limited to that portion of the Cellular Earn-Out
Payment for such Earn-Out Payment Quarter allocated to such Participating
Rights Holders pursuant to _Section 2.1_.

(e) _Contingent Payments Not Certain_. Without limiting the obligations of
Parent pursuant to _Section 6.13_ (Operating Plan), each of Parent, the
Company and the Stockholder Representative hereby acknowledges that the
amount of Net Sales, if any, that the Surviving Corporation may generate
during any Earn-Out Payment Quarter is uncertain and that the Surviving
Corporation may not generate any Net Sales in such periods, and it
is therefore not assured that Parent will be required to pay any Contingent
Payments for any such period, or at all.

 



9 (f) _Maximum Aggregate Contingent Payments_. Subject to the Set-off Rights,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to make (i)
any Revenue Earn-Out Payments once Parent and the Surviving Corporation have
made Revenue Earn-Out Payments based on Revenue Earn-Out Amounts that equal,
in the aggregate, the Maximum Revenue Earn-Out Amount, or (ii) any Cellular
Earn-Out Payments once Parent and the Surviving Corporation have made Cellular
Earn-Out Payments based on Cellular Earn-Out Amounts that equal, in the
aggregate, the Maximum Cellular Earn-Out Amount. To the extent that any
provision of _Section 1.6_ would otherwise require Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to make any Contingent Payment in respect of any Earn-Out Payment
Quarter that would, if paid in full, result in Parent and the Surviving
Corporation paying Contingent Payments based on Revenue Earn-Out Amounts or
Cellular Earn-Out Amounts, as applicable (including the amount of any
Accelerated Earn-Out Amount), that, in the aggregate, exceed the
Maximum Revenue Earn-Out Amount or Maximum Cellular Earn-Out Amount, as
applicable, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce
the applicable amount of such Contingent Payment such that the Maximum Revenue
Earn-Out Amount or Maximum Cellular Earn-Out Amount, as applicable, is not
exceeded. For purposes of the calculations for this _Section 1.6(f)_, any
amounts offset by Parent or the Surviving Corporation against any Contingent
Payments made pursuant to _Sections 1.5(c)_ and _1.7(b)_ and _Article 9_
(indemnification) shall be deemed to have been paid to the Participating
Rights Holders.

1.7 _Payment of Contingent Payments_.

(a) _Earn-Out Payment Certificates; Payments_. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the last day of each Earn-Out Payment Quarter, but in no
event later than the public announcement of Parents results of operations for
such Earn-Out Payment Quarter, Parent shall: 

(i) deliver to the Stockholder Representative a certificate (each, an " _Earn-
Out Payment Certificate_ "), setting forth Parents determination of (A) the
amount of aggregate Cellular Earn-Out Revenue for such Earn-Out Payment
Quarter, and, if in respect of an Earn-Out Payment Quarter in the Earn-Out
Payment Year, the amount of aggregate Net Sales, and (B) the Cellular Earn-
Out Amount for such Earn-Out Payment Quarter, and, if in respect of an Earn-
Out Payment Quarter in the Earn-Out Payment Year, the Revenue Earn-Out Amount
for such Earn-Out Payment Quarter; and

 

(ii) cause the Paying Agent to deliver to each of the Participating Rights
Holders, in accordance with and subject to the exchange provisions set forth
in _Section_ _2.2,_ that portion of the applicable Contingent Payments for
such Earn-Out Payment Quarter as set forth in the Earn-Out Payment Certificate
allocated to such Participating Rights Holder pursuant to  _Section 2.1_.

(b) _Stockholder Representative Objections_. The Stockholder Representative
shall have a period of thirty (30) days in which to provide written notice to
Parent of any objections to the Earn-Out Payment Certificate and the amount of
the Contingent Payments the Stockholder Representative believes to be payable
to the Participating Rights Holders in addition to the Contingent Payment
previously paid under _Section 1.7(a)(ii)_ above consistent with the process
set forth in _Section 1.5(c)_. Any dispute with respect to the Earn-Out
Payment Certificate 

 



10  shall be resolved in a manner consistent with process set forth in _Section
1.5(c)_ as though it were a dispute relating to the Parent Closing Payment
Calculation. During this period, Parent shall provide the Stockholder
Representative with reasonable access to the Surviving Corporations books of
account and records used to prepare the Earn-Out Payment Certificate and the
management of the Surviving Corporation, for the purpose of verifying the
amounts set forth therein.

(c) _Payment of Contingent Payment_. Upon the earliest of (x) the thirtieth
(30th) day following delivery to the Stockholder Representative of the
applicable Earn-Out Payment Certificate without the Stockholder Representative
having delivered notice of any objections to such Certificate, (y) the tenth
(10th) day following delivery by the Stockholder Representative of a written
notice expressly accepting Parents Earn-Out Payment Certificate and the
amounts set forth thereon, or (z) the final determination of any disputes in
accordance with paragraph (b) above, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to deliver to each of the Participating Rights Holders any remaining portion
of the applicable Contingent Payments not previously paid under _Section
1.7(a)(ii)_ above for such Earn-Out Payment Quarter as set forth in the Earn-
Out Payment Certificate, or as such amounts are finally determined in
accordance with paragraph (b) above, allocated to such Participating Rights
Holder pursuant to _Section 2.1_, in each case in accordance with and subject
to the exchange provisions set forth in _Section 2.2_.

(d) _Right of Set-Off_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement and subject to the qualifications set forth in _Article 9_ , the
obligation of Parent to make any Contingent Payment shall be qualified in its
entirety by the right of Parent and Surviving Corporation to reduce the amount
of such Contingent Payment by the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages in
respect of one or more Set-Off Eligible Claims to which any Parent Indemnified
Party is entitled pursuant to _Article 9_ (indemnification) or as provided
in  _Section 1.5(c)_, _provided_ that any amount to be set-off in respect of
a Fraud Claim may be set-off only to the extent permitted in _Section 9.5_,
_provided_ , _further_ , that a Parent Indemnified Party shall be required to
recover the first $4,000,000 of any Set-Off Eligible Claim from the Escrowed
Fund not otherwise subject to a pending Indemnification Claim and thereafter
any remaining amount subject to the Set-Off Eligible Claims may be recovered
from the Contingent Payments or the Escrow Funds, as elected by Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of payment of a
Contingent Payment with respect to which a set-off is to be made in respect
of a Set-Off Eligible Claim, Parent shall first notify the Stockholder
Representative in writing of such intent, _provided, however,_ Parent shall
pay the Contingent Payments not subject to such set-off in accordance with
_Section 1.7(a)_. Following receipt of such written notice, the Stockholder
Representative shall have a period of thirty (30) days in which to provide
written notice to Parent of any objections thereto. If the Stockholder
Representative does not give such written notice within such 30-day period,
Parent shall be entitled to make such set-off against the Contingent Payment
pursuant to this _Section 1.7(d)_. If the Stockholder Representative gives
such written notice of objection within such 30-day period, then the
Stockholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve
any dispute concerning such amount to be set-off. If the Stockholder
Representative and Parent do not resolve any dispute concerning such amount
to be set-off within ten (10) days after the date of delivery of the written
notice by the Stockholder Representative, the amount to be set-off (or any
disputed portion thereof) shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent as
"Additional Escrow Funds" pending final determination of such set-off

 



11  amount consistent with the process set forth in _Section 1.5(c)_, and
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make the balance of such Contingent
Payment to the Participating Rights Holders within ten (10) days thereof in
accordance with and subject to the exchange provisions set forth in _Section
2.2_. In the event that the aggregate amount set-off from a Contingent Payment
made to the Participating Rights Holders pursuant to this _Section 1.7(d)_
is greater than the aggregate amount of Damages finally determined to be
payable in respect of such indemnification claim in accordance with _Article
9_ (indemnification), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, or shall
cause the Escrow Agent, within ten (10) days after such final determination of
the amount of Damages finally determined to be payable in respect of such
indemnification claim in accordance with  _Article 9_ (indemnification), pay
the amount of such excess, without interest, to the Participating Rights
Holders in cash in accordance with this _Section 1.7_ in the respective
amounts they would have been entitled to receive had such amount not been
retained or set-off by Parent.

(e) _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of this  _Section 1.7_ also shall
apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the
obligations of Parent under this _Section 1.7_ shall commence on the date of
loss of such status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange for such shares the payments to which such holder would
otherwise have been entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof had such shares
of Company capital stock not been Dissenting Shares at the Effective Time.

1.8 _Form of Consideration Payable by Parent_.

 

(a) _Parent Stock_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section 1.8(a)_ and
_Section 1.8(b)_ below, at the sole discretion of Parent, any portion or all
of any Contingent Payment that may be payable to any Participating Rights
Holder may be satisfied by (i) the issuance to such Participating Rights
Holder of that number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the amount of the Contingent Payment payable to such
Participating Rights Holder that Parent has elected to satisfy through the
issuance of whole shares of Parent Stock, by (y) the Parent Average
Stock Price on the date of payment, with any fraction of a share of Parent
Stock being treated as provided in _Section 1.8(c)_ below, (ii) payment of
such amount in cash, or (iii) a combination of the forms of consideration
referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) and shall be paid, whether
in cash or Parent Stock, within ten (10) days of final determination of the
Contingent Payment.

(b) _Conditions_. The right of Parent to pay all or any portion of any
Contingent Payment to any Participating Rights Holder through the delivery of
shares of Parent Stock shall, upon the date such shares are issued to such
Participating Rights Holder, be subject to the satisfaction of all of the
following conditions:

 

(i) any and all such shares shall either be (A) saleable, subject to any
restrictions that would be imposed as a result of such Participating Rights
Holder being an "affiliate" pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, on
the date of delivery, without requiring further registration under the
Securities Act and without any further holding period being imposed by the
Securities Act, or (B) the subject of a registration statement on Form S-3 (or
any successor form), which shall be effective on the date of delivery of such
shares, _provided_ that Parent shall use best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement for a

 



12  period of at least 12 months following the date of the issuance of Parent
Stock (or until such earlier date on which all of the shares of Parent Stock
covered by such registration statement have been actually sold), _provided_ ,
_further_ , if such registration statement (or a successor registration
statement on Form S-3 covering such shares of Parent Stock) is no longer
effective for a period of time in excess of five (5) consecutive trading days
during such 12-month period, then each Participating Rights Holder holding
shares of Parent Stock issued pursuant to this Registration Statement shall be
entitled, as such Participating Rights Holders sole and exclusive remedy in
respect of such failure of such registration statement to be effective, to
cause the Parent to repurchase some or all of such shares of Parent Stock
(unless such shares are then freely saleable, subject to any restrictions
that would be imposed as a result of such Participating Rights Holder being
an "affiliate" pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, without
requiring further registration under the Securities Act and without any
further holding period being imposed by the Securities Act, or unless such
repurchase is otherwise prohibited by Law), by written notice given to Parent
(which written notice shall constitute an irrevocable offer to sell such
shares to Parent at the price specified in this _Section 1.8(b)(i)_) on any
such date when such registration statement is not effective, at a price equal
to the closing price of a share of Parent Stock on the principal exchange on
which the Parent Stock is then traded on the date on which such notice is
received by Parent;

(ii) any and all such shares shall have been listed on each securities
exchange on which similar securities, including as to class and series,
issued by Parent are then listed, subject only to notice of issuance, and on
the date of delivery there shall be no suspension of trade with respect to the
tradeability of the Parent Stock issued to the Participating Rights Holders
hereunder on such securities exchange; and

(iii) any and all such shares shall have been duly authorized and reserved
for issuance, and upon issuance thereof in accordance with this Agreement, be
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(c) _No Fractional Shares_. In the event that all or any portion of any
Contingent Payment is paid by delivery of shares of Parent Stock, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be
issued, but an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Parent Average Stock
price on the date of payment of all such fractional shares shall instead be
deposited with the Stockholder Representative as additional
Representative Reimbursement Amount.

(d) _Legend_. Any certificate issued to any Participating Rights Holders who
are "affiliates" representing shares of Parent Stock that have not been
registered under the Securities Act and are subject to Rule 144 of the
Securities Act shall be imprinted with the following legend (or the
substantial equivalent thereof):

"THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OTHER THAN
PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION UNDER SAID ACT OR IN CONFORMITY WITH THE LIMITATIONS
OF RULE 144 OR OTHER SIMILAR RULE OR EXEMPTION AS THEN IN EFFECT."

 



13 In the event that any certificate issued to any Participating Rights Holders
representing shares of Parent Stock is imprinted with the foregoing legend
(or a similar legend), Parent shall cause such legends to be removed in
connection with any resale of such shares of Parent Stock that is made in
compliance with, or pursuant to a valid exemption from, the registration
provisions of the Securities Act.

In the event Parent Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement is registered
pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3, any Participating Rights
Holders who is an executive officer of the Company shall not be prohibited
from entering into a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule
10b5-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act to cover the resale of Parent Stock
issued to such Participating Rights Holders, _provided_ , _however_ , any
such plan shall be subject to Parents current insider trading policy.

Participating Rights Holders will be converted at the Effective Time into (i)
the right to receive from Parent an amount equal to (A) the Per Share Closing
Payment,  _plus_ (B) the Per Share Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit, _plus_ (C)

shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in this
_Section 2.1(a)_ upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with
_Section 2.2_ and this _Section 2.1_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) a
portion of the Closing Payment and Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit otherwise
attributable to the Company Capital Stock shall be deposited with the Escrow
Agent pursuant to _Sections 1.5(b)_ hereof and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, (y) a portion of the Closing Payment otherwise attributable to the
Company Capital Stock shall be deposited with the Stockholder Representative

(c) _Disposition of Company Options and Stock Appreciation Rights_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding, vested and
immediately exercisable (i.e., exercisable without the occurrence of any
other condition other than as set forth in paragraph (iv) below) on or prior
to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into (i) the right to

Company Option is then exercisable, (A) an amount in cash equal to the excess,
if any, of the sum of (x) the Per Share Closing Payment, _plus_ (y) the Per
Share Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit, _less_ (z) the exercise price per share
of such Company Option, _plus_ (B) the Per Share Revenue Earn-Out Payment
associated with each Revenue Earn-Out Payment, if such Revenue Earn-Out
Payment is required to be made pursuant to _Sections 1.6_ and  _1.7_ hereof,

in accordance with _Section 2.5(f)_ below (collectively, the " _Option

through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation (or subsidiary
employer), and shall be subject to all applicable withholding obligations

hereof and the terms of the Escrow Agreement, (y) a portion of the Closing
Payment otherwise attributable to the Company Options shall be deposited with
the Stockholder Representative pursuant to _Section 1.5(b),_ and (z) any
Contingent Payment otherwise attributable to the Company Options may be
reduced pursuant to the rights of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under
_Sections 1.5(c)_ and _1.7(d)_. Payments of the Option Consideration shall be
made at the same times that the corresponding payments of the Merger
Consideration are made to the Company Stockholders, and in any event within
five (5) years following the Closing Date, to the extent necessary to comply
with Section 409A.

 

(ii) Except as provided in _Section 2.1(c)(iv)_ and subject to _Section
5.4(c)_, the terms of each outstanding unvested Company Option shall be
adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each such
unvested Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be assumed by Parent. Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under
this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable Company Option documents (including any
applicable Company Option Plan and stock option agreement or other document
evidencing such Company Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each
such unvested Company Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable
in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Stock
equal to the product of the number of unvested shares of Company Capital Stock
that were subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the ratio 

 



15  of (x) the sum of the Option Per Share Closing Payment _plus_ the Per Share
Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit, to (y) the Parent Average Stock Price on the
third trading day prior to the Effective Time (such ratio, the " _Option
Ratio_ "), rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Stock,
and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Capital Stock
at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Option Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
Following the Effective Time, Parents board of directors or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Company Board
or any committee thereof with respect to each assumed Company Option.

(iii) Subject to _Section 5.4(c)_, the terms of each outstanding unvested
Company SAR shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Effective
Time, each such unvested Company SAR outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent. Each Company SAR so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company SAR documents
(including any applicable stock appreciation rights plan and stock
appreciation rights agreement or other document evidencing such Company SAR)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any vesting provisions),
except that (i) each such unvested Company SAR will be exercisable for cash
upon vesting with respect to that number of whole shares of Parent Stock equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Capital Stock that were
subject to such Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied
by the Option Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for each assumed Company
SAR will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per share
exercise price applicable to such Company SAR immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Option Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
Following the Effective Time, Parent shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Companys Chief Executive Officer to concur to any
actions taken under the LitePoint Technologies (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
Appreciation Rights Plan, as set forth in such plan.

(iv) The vesting and exercisability of each outstanding Company Option or
Company RSA held by a non-employee director or former non-employee director,
if any, of the Company or its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time, shall
accelerate (if not then vested and exercisable) as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and such Company Options or Company RSA shall be canceled at
the Effective Time (with no consideration payable in connection with such
cancellation except to the extent provided in _Section 2.1(a)_ or _2.1(c)_ ).
In no event shall the Company Options or Company RSAs described in this
_Section 2.1(c)(iv)_ be assumed by Parent. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
limit or otherwise change Parents obligations pursuant to _Section 5.4_.

 

(d) _Treasury Stock_. Each share of Company Capital Stock held in the treasury
of the Company or held by any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished at the Effective Time
without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

 



16 (e) _Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one (1) validly issued fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Transmittal Materials for Closing Payment_.

 

(a) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) Parent shall engage Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") to effect the distribution of payments required to be made by Parent
and the Surviving Corporation hereunder to the Participating Rights Holders.
Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, will require those Participating
Rights Holders entitled to receive at the Closing a portion of the Closing
Payment and Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit in respect of their shares of
Company Capital Stock or in respect of their Company Options to complete and
return to the Paying Agent a letter of transmittal in substantially the form
of _Exhibit C-1_ hereto and/or option cancellation agreement in substantially
the form of _Exhibit C-2 hereto_ (in the case of Participating Rights Holders
who are not employees of the Company), and to Parent the option cancellation
agreement in substantially the form of _Exhibit C-3_ hereto (in the case of
Participating Rights Holders who are employees of the Company), and in each
case which shall include a general release in substantially the form of
_Exhibit C-4_ hereto (collectively, the " _Transmittal Materials_ "). The
Company shall distribute, or shall cause the Paying Agent to distribute, the
applicable Transmittal Materials to eligible Participating Rights Holders. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount (the " _Payment Fund_
") equal to (i) the Closing Payment Amount, plus (ii) the Estimated Deemed Tax
Benefit, _minus_ (iii) the Closing Escrow Amount,  _minus_ (iv) the
Representative Reimbursement Amount. Such funds shall be invested as directed
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pending payment thereof by the Paying
Agent to the Participating Rights Holders. Earnings from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving Corporation, and no
part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of the Participating Rights
Holders. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to deliver to each Participating Rights
Holder who has completed the Transmittal Materials and returned them to Parent
at or prior to the Closing, together with the certificate or certificates
representing outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") or instruments representing outstanding Company Options
(each, a " _Derivative Instrument_ " and collectively, " _Derivative
Instruments_ "), a check or a wire transfer representing that portion of the
Closing Payment and Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit to which such Participating
Rights Holder is entitled. The delivery of such checks or wire transfers by
Parent or the Paying Agent shall be deemed, for all purposes, to have
satisfied in full the obligations of Parent to pay the Closing Payment and
Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit to such Participating Rights Holders and Parent
shall have no further obligation for such payments to such
Participating Rights Holder, except as set forth in _Sections 1.5(c)(iv)_
and _(v)_. Parent shall not be required to pay any amount of the Closing
Payment, the Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit or any Contingent Payment to any
Participating Rights Holder until receipt from such Participating Rights
Holder of properly completed and executed Transmittal Materials and the
applicable Certificate or Derivative Instruments. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this  _Section 2.2(a)_, Parent shall make payment of any
amounts due in respect to Company Options under this Agreement to individuals
who are employees of the Company immediately

 



17  prior to the Effective Time, or were employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and for whose payments Parent or the Company may have withholding
obligations, through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, and a
portion of the Payment Fund payable to such individuals shall not be paid to
the Paying Agent but shall instead be deposited with the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time. 

(ii) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) days,
after the Effective Time, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, will
send to each Participating Rights Holder who does not submit completed
Transmittal Materials to Parent at or before the Closing, as permitted by
_Section 2.2(a)(i)_ above, the applicable Transmittal Materials for use in
exchanging his, her or its Certificates or Derivative Instruments for the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration into which such shares of
Company Capital Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares) or Company Options
have been converted. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.2_, each Certificate and Derivative Instrument shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the applicable amounts of Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 2.1_. Upon receipt of the completed applicable Transmittal Materials
and the applicable Certificates and Derivative Instruments, Parent or the
Paying Agent will deliver to the applicable Participating Rights Holder a
check or a wire transfer representing that portion of the Closing Payment and
Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit to which such Participating Rights Holder is
entitled.

 

(iii) Parent shall be entitled to rely entirely on the information contained
in the Capitalization and Closing Payment Amount Certificate and the
Transmittal Materials delivered hereunder for purposes of satisfying Parents
obligation to deliver the Merger Consideration hereunder.

(b) _No Further Rights in Certificates or Derivative Instruments_. From and
after the Effective Time, holders of Company Capital Stock or Company Options
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to be, and
will have no rights as, stockholders or rightsholders of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, other than (i) in the case of Company Capital Stock
(other than Dissenting Shares) and Company Options, the rights to receive the
applicable portions of the Merger Consideration, including the Escrowed Funds
or the Representative Reimbursement Amount at the times, if any, provided by
this Agreement; (ii) in the case of Dissenting Shares, the rights afforded to
the holders thereof under Delaware Law; and (iii) rights under this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 2.2(b)_
shall in no way limit the rights of holders of unvested Company Options
immediately prior to the Effective Time as holders, from and after the
Effective Time, of options to acquire shares of Parent Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)(ii)_.

 

(c) _Termination of Payment Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the
first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any earnings received with respect thereto) that had been
made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to
Participating Rights Holders and thereafter such Participating Rights Holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) with respect to the
applicable Merger Consideration payable to them, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying

 



18  Agent shall be liable to any Securityholder for any amounts delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(d) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Paying
Agent and Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement to any holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or any other
Person such amounts as each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Paying
Agent and Escrow Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or
any Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made. For the avoidance of doubt, to
the extent any amounts are required to be so withheld from any of the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, such
amounts required to be withheld shall be distributed to Parent (or an entity
designated by Parent) to enable Parent (or any such designated entity) to
comply with its withholding obligations (including without limitation,
any obligations of the Company or the Surviving Corporation). Parent shall
remit, in a timely manner, to the Taxation Authority any such amounts withheld
pursuant to this _Section 2.2(d)_.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate(s)
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an
affidavit of that fact by the Company Stockholder thereof in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay such
Company Stockholder such Company Stockholders portion of the Closing Payment
and Estimated Deemed Tax Benefit as provided in _Section 2.1_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition
precedent to issuing such instruction to the Paying Agent, require the owner
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of
indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and a bond in such
sum as Parent may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of such Certificates
representing such shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except
as otherwise provided herein or by any applicable Laws.

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive any portion of the amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1_, but
the holders thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by
Delaware Law or California Law. All Dissenting Shares held by stockholders
who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or
lost their dissenters rights shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the later of the Effective
Time or the occurrence of such event,

 



19  the right to receive an appropriate portion of the amounts to be paid
pursuant to _Section 2.1_, without any interest thereon, upon remittance of
the Transmittal Materials and surrender, in the manner provided in _Section
2.2_, of the Certificate that formerly evidenced such shares.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands under
Delaware Law or California Law for fair value of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock received by the Company, any withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law or
California Law, if any, and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity
to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair
value under Delaware Law or California Law, if any. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any demands for the fair value of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock or settle or offer to settle any such demands other than by
operation of law or pursuant to a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

2.5 _Stockholder Representative_.

(a) _Appointment of Stockholder Representative_. Michael Goguen is hereby
appointed, effective from and after the date of the Stockholder Approval, to
act as the Stockholder Representative under this Agreement in accordance with
the terms of this _Section 2.5_ and the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) _Successor Stockholder Representative_. If the Stockholder Representative
or any successor shall die, resign or become unable to act as the Stockholder
Representative, a replacement (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent)
shall promptly be appointed by a writing signed by Participating Rights
Holders who represent _pro rata_ interests in the Escrowed Fund in excess of
66-2/3% of all of such interests. Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be
notified promptly in writing of such appointment. Unless and until Parent and
the Escrow Agent shall have received written notice of the appointment of a
successor Stockholder Representative, Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on, and shall be fully protected relying on, the power and
authority of the Stockholder Representative to act on behalf of the
Participating Rights Holders. 

(c) _Authority After the Effective Time_. From and after the Effective Time,
the Stockholder Representative shall be authorized, on behalf of the
Participating Rights Holders, to:

(i) take all actions required or permitted by, and exercise all rights
granted to, the Stockholder Representative in this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement;

(ii) receive all notices or other documents given or to be given to the
Stockholder Representative by Parent pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement;

(iii) receive and accept service of legal process in connection with any claim
or other proceeding against the Participating Rights Holders or the Company
arising under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

 



20 (iv) negotiate, undertake, compromise, defend, resolve and settle any suit,
proceeding or dispute under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement on behalf
of the Participating Rights Holders;

(v) execute and deliver all agreements, certificates and documents required
or deemed appropriate by the Stockholder Representative in connection with any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including executing and
delivering the Escrow Agreement); 

(vi) engage special counsel, accountants and other advisors and incur such
other expenses in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

(vii) apply the Representative Reimbursement Amount to the payment of (or
reimbursement of the Stockholder Representative for) expenses and liabilities
which the Stockholder Representative may incur pursuant to this _Section
2.5_;

 

(vii) take such other action as the Stockholder Representative may deem
appropriate, including:

 

(A) agreeing to any modification or amendment of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement and executing and delivering an agreement of such modification or
amendment;

(B) taking any actions required or permitted under the Escrow Agreement; and

 

(C) all such other matters as the Stockholder Representative may deem
necessary or appropriate to carry out the intents and purposes of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(d) _Reimbursement of Expenses_. The Stockholder Representative shall
be entitled to receive reimbursement from any Representative Reimbursement
Amounts retained on behalf of the Stockholder Representative, for any and all
expenses, charges and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys fees,
incurred by the Stockholder Representative in the performance or discharge of
his rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (the
" _SR Expenses_ "). The Representative Reimbursement Amount shall only be used
for the payment of the SR Expenses or as otherwise required by this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement.

(e) _Release from Liability; Indemnification; Authority of Stockholder
Representative_. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the merger by the Company Stockholders, each Participating Rights Holder
shall be deemed to and does hereby release the Stockholder Representative
from, and each Participating Rights Holder, by virtue of such adoption and
approval, shall further be deemed to agree to indemnify the Stockholder
Representative against, liability for any action taken or not taken by him in
his capacity as such agent, except for the liability of the Stockholder
Representative to a Participating Rights Holder for loss which such holder may
suffer from the gross negligence of the Stockholder 

 



21  Representative in carrying out his duties hereunder. By virtue of the
adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the Company
Stockholders, each Participating Rights Holder (regardless of whether or not
such Participating Rights Holder votes in favor of the adoption of the
Agreement and the approval of the Merger, whether at a meeting or by written
consent in lieu thereof) shall be deemed to appoint, as of the Agreement
Date, the Stockholder Representative as his true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact to enter into any agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to exercise all or any of the
powers, authority and discretion conferred on him, her or it under any such
agreement, to give and receive notices on their behalf and to be his, her or
its exclusive representative with respect to any matter, suit, claim, action
or proceeding arising with respect to any transaction contemplated by any
such agreement, including, without limitation, the defense, settlement or
compromise of any claim, action or proceeding for which Parent or the
Surviving Corporation may be entitled to indemnification and, by virtue of
its approval of the Agreement, the Stockholder Representative agrees to act
as, and to undertake the duties and responsibilities of, such agent and
attorney-in-fact. This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable. All actions, decisions and instructions of the Stockholder
Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Participating
Rights Holders.

(f) _Distribution of Representative Reimbursement Amount_. Any of the
Representative Reimbursement Amount deposited with the Stockholder
Representative at the Closing that has not been consumed by the Stockholder
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement
on or prior to the end of the period in which Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their Affiliates may make claims for indemnification pursuant
to  _Section 9.5_ or, if later, the date on which all indemnification claims
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates outstanding at
the end of such period have been discharged in full, shall be distributed by
the Stockholder Representative to the Participating Rights Holders on a
proportionate basis based on the respective portions of the Closing Payment
Amount such Participating Rights Holders would otherwise be entitled to
receive hereunder, absent deposit of the Representative Reimbursement Amount
with the Stockholder Representative in accordance with _Section 1.5(b)_.

 

2.6 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to
all assets, property, rights, privileges and powers of the Company and Merger
Sub, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully
authorized in the name of the Company and Merger Sub or otherwise to take, and
shall take, all such action.

 

ARTICLE 3

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows as of each of
(a) the Agreement Date, and (b) the Closing Date, except as specifically
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that such representations and
warranties shall be deemed to be qualified for purposes of this Agreement by
the attached Disclosure Schedule of the Company (as amended, the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ "). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
or such Company Disclosure Schedule, each exception set forth in the Company
Disclosure

 



22  Schedule will be deemed to qualify only each representation and warranty set
forth in this Agreement that is specifically identified (by cross-reference or
otherwise) in the Company Disclosure Schedule as being qualified by such
exception, or where the relevance of such exception as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) another representation and warranty set forth in
this Agreement would be readily apparent on it face to an individual who has
read such exception and such other representation and warranty. The Company
may amend subsections (k) and (l) of _Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ after the date hereof and prior to the Closing to reflect any
claims made by any third parties during the period between the Agreement Date
and the Closing Date by providing such updates to Parent in a writing signed
by the Companys Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.
In addition, for purposes of determining accuracy as of the Closing Date of
the representations and warranties of the Company under _Section 3.3_
(capitalization) hereof only, the _Company Disclosure Schedule_ shall be
deemed to have been updated by the information set forth in the
Capitalization and Closing Payment Amount Certificate.

3.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on the Company Business. The Company has not been
dissolved and is not in the process of being dissolved by any corporate
resolutions or other action by its directors (or members of similar governing
bodies) or equity holders, any Governmental Authority, or by the occurrence
of any event or otherwise. _Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_
sets forth each jurisdiction where the Company is qualified, licensed or
admitted to do business and separately lists each other state, province or
country in which the Company owns, uses, licenses or leases its assets or
properties, conducts business, has employees or engages independent
contractors. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to transact business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except where failure to
be so qualified or in good standing would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.2 _Subsidiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.2 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, the Company does not have any Subsidiaries and does not
presently own or control, directly or indirectly, any interest in any other
corporation, association, partnership, limited liability company or
other business entity. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
participant in any joint venture or similar arrangement. The Company has not,
at any time, been a general partner of, or has been responsible or liable for
any of the debts or other obligations of, any other Person.

3.3 _Capitalization; Voting and Other Rights_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of:

(i) _Common Stock_. 38,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, $0.01 par value
per share, 15,261,146 shares of which are issued and outstanding; and

 

(ii) _Preferred Stock_. 12,000,000 shares of the Company preferred stock,
$0.001 par value per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "), of which
10,775,252 shares

 



23  have been designated Series A Preferred Stock (the " _Series A Preferred
Stock_"), all of which are issued and outstanding. The respective rights,
restrictions, privileges and preferences of the Company Preferred Stock are
as stated in the Company Charter.

(b) Except as set forth in  _Section 3.3(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, there are no outstanding options, warrants, instruments, rights
(including conversion or preemptive rights, rights of first refusal,
registration rights (including piggyback rights) or rights of first offer),
proxy or stockholder agreements, or other agreements or instruments of any
kind, including convertible debt instruments, for the purchase or acquisition
from the Company of any of its Securities. Except as set forth in  _Section
3.3(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, the Company is not a party or
subject to any agreement or understanding and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no agreement or understanding between any other
Persons, (i) that affects or relates to the voting or giving of written
consents with respect to any Security or by a director of the Company other
than as contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) with respect to the issuance,
sale or transfer of Securities, (iii) relating to the registration of, or
restricting any Person from purchasing, selling, pledging or otherwise
disposing of (or granting any option or similar right with respect to), any
Securities, or (iv) requiring the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any Securities.

(c) All of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock (i) have been duly authorized and validly issued and

applicable state and federal Laws concerning the issuance of securities. All
Company Options were issued in compliance with all applicable Laws concerning
the issuance of securities and made in accordance with the terms of the
Company Option Plan and in compliance with all applicable Law. Each grant
of Company Options was duly authorized no later than the date on which the
grant of such Company Option was by its terms to be effective by all necessary
corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the board of directors
of the Company (or a duly authorized committee or subcommittee thereof) and
any required stockholder approval by the necessary number of votes or written
consents. Each Company Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the Code, if any, so qualifies. All of the
shares of Company Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of the
Company Preferred Stock or pursuant to the exercise of outstanding Company
Options will, when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(d) Each series of Company Preferred Stock is presently convertible into
Company Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder will not result in any anti-dilution
adjustment or other similar adjustment to the outstanding shares of Company
Preferred Stock.

(e) _Section 3.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth the name
of record of each Securityholder and the Securities owned beneficially and of
record by each Securityholder, and, in the case of options to acquire capital
stock of the Company, (i) the per-share exercise price payable therefor, (ii)

vested or exercisable for as of September 15, 2011, (iii) whether the holder
of such option is an employee of the Company, (iv) whether the vesting of such
option shall be accelerated by a change of control of the Company, including
as a result of the Merger,

 



24  (v) whether or not any such options are intended to be "incentive stock
options" as such term is defined in the Code, and (vi) the date of grant of
such options. To the Knowledge of the Company, each Securityholder of record
owns all beneficial interest in such Securities.

(f) Each Company SAR is unvested and not exercisable.

3.4 _Authorization; Binding Obligations; Governmental Consents_.

 

(a) The Company has all corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the Related Agreements to the extent it is a party, to

Merger, to obtaining the Stockholder Approval. The Company Board has
unanimously determined that the Merger is in the best interests of the
Company and the Company Stockholders, has approved, in accordance with Section
251 of Delaware Law, this Agreement and declared its advisability, and has

the Related Agreements, to the extent it is a party, will be valid and
legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its
respective terms, except as limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, and other Laws of general application affecting
enforcement of creditors rights, and (ii) general principles of equity that
restrict the availability of equitable remedies.

(b) No consent, approval, permit, order or authorization of, or registration,

local Governmental Authority on the part of the Company is required in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, except (i) the filing of the Merger Certificate with the Delaware
Secretary of State; (ii) such consents, approvals, orders authorizations,
registrations declarations and filings as may be required under applicable
state and federal securities Laws and the securities Laws of any foreign
country the failure of which to be obtained or made, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect, or adversely affect the ability of the Company to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and
(iii) such filings as may be required under any Competition Laws. No "business
combination," "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or
other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation is applicable to this

Agreement.

valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms and, except for
policies that have expired under their terms in the ordinary course, is in
full force and effect; and (ii) the Company is not in material breach or
default (including any such breach or default with respect to the payment of
premiums or the giving of notice), and no event has occurred which, with
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default, or
permit termination or modification, under the policy.

(c) To the Companys Knowledge, there has been no circumstance or breach of
any terms, conditions, representations or warranties under any of the

premiums when due and has otherwise performed all of its respective
obligations under all insurance policies. No insurer has threatened
to terminate any of the insurance policies, to reduce the scope of the
insurance or to materially increase the premiums owed. The Company has given

insurance policies. The insurance policies will continue to be in full force
and effect following the closing of the Transaction and will not terminate or
lapse by reason of the Merger.

3.20 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) _Identification of Plans_. Except as disclosed in _Section 3.20(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries currently maintains or contributes to, or has any outstanding

46  under, any pension, profit-sharing, deferred compensation, bonus, stock
option, employment, share appreciation right, severance, group or individual
health, dental, medical, life insurance, survivor benefit, key men insurance,
education fund, motor vehicle or similar plan, policy, arrangement or
agreement, whether formal or informal, written or oral, for the benefit of any
current or former director, officer or employee of or consultant to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. Each of the arrangements
set forth in _Section 3.20(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ is herein
referred to as an " _Employee Benefit Plan_ ", except that any such
arrangement which is a multi-employer plan shall be treated as an Employee
Benefit Plan only for purposes of _Sections 3.20(d)(ii)_ and _(vi)_ and

correct and complete copies of each Employee Benefit Plan and, with respect

(including specifically any summary plan descriptions) submitted to any
governmental agency or distributed to participants or beneficiaries thereunder

court orders, or governmental rules or regulations and other Laws (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, applicable Laws of any foreign jurisdictions where
employees are employed) in effect from time to time, including ERISA and
the Code, and applicable to such Employee Benefit Plan. Each Employee Benefit
Plan which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and each
trust or other entity intended to qualify as a "voluntary employee
benefit association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and
associated with any Employee Benefit Plan is expressly identified as such in
_Section 3.20(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ and has been determined
to be so qualified by the IRS, may rely on an opinion letter issued by the
IRS with respect to a standardized prototype plan adopted in accordance with
the requirements for such reliance, or has time remaining for application to
the IRS for a determination of the qualified status of such Employee Benefit
Plan and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred as to each
which has resulted or is likely to result in the revocation or denial of such
determination or which, to the Knowledge of the Company, would not reasonably
be expected to be resolved without such revocation or denial under the
compliance resolution programs of the IRS to preserve such qualification.

_Section 3.20(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_:

(i) there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened legal
action, proceeding or investigation, other than routine claims for benefits,

basis for any such legal action or proceeding;

Subsidiary of the Company is subject to Title IV of ERISA;

has, to the Knowledge of the Company, engaged in a prohibited transaction
which could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries directly or
indirectly to liability under Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code;

(v) no Employee Benefit Plan provides welfare benefits subsequent to
termination of employment to employees or their beneficiaries except to the
extent required by applicable state Laws and Title I, Part 6 of ERISA;

maintain any Employee Benefit Plan for any period of time and each such
Employee Benefit Plan is terminable at the sole discretion of the sponsor
thereof, subject only to such constraints as may be imposed by applicable Law
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, applicable Laws of any foreign
jurisdictions where employees are employed).

(viii) No Employee Benefit Plan provides medical benefits beyond termination
of employment or retirement other than healthcare continuation coverage under
Section 4980B of the Code.

time without liability or expense to the Company or Subsidiaries of the
Company as a result thereof, and no plan documentation or agreement, summary
plan, description, or other written communication regarding any such
plan restricts or prohibits the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company from
amending or terminating any Employee Benefit Plan.

(e)  _Funding of Certain Plans_. With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan
for which a separate fund of assets is or is required to be maintained, full
and timely payment has been made of all amounts required of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, under the terms of each such
Employee Benefit Plan or applicable Law (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, applicable Laws of any foreign jurisdictions where employees are
employed), as applied through the Closing Date, the consummation of the
Merger or a short-form

 



48  merger, and no accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in Section 302 of
ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, exists with respect
to any such Employee Benefit Plan. The current value of the assets of each
such Employee Benefit Plan, as of the end of the most recently ended plan year
of that Employee Benefit Plan, equals or exceeds the current value of all
benefits liabilities under that Employee Benefit Plan.

(f) _Effect of Transactions_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.20(f) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_, the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, will not, by themselves or in combination in any other event
(regardless of whether that other event has or will occur), result in any
payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from or under any
Employee Benefit Plan (including any employment agreement) to any current or
former director, officer or employee of or consultant to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or result in the vesting, acceleration of payment or
increases in the amount of any benefit payable to or in respect of any such
current or former director, officer or employee of or consultant to the

have the same meaning assigned such terms under Sections 3, 4043(b) or 4001(a)
of ERISA, and "affiliate" means any entity which under Section 414 of the
Code is treated as a single employer with the Company, determined, however,
without regard to this Agreement.

3.21 _Brokers_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.21 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, no finder, broker, agent or similar intermediary has
acted for or on behalf of the Company or its stockholders or any Subsidiary of
the Company in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Property nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, such Leased Real Property, are
in material violation of any Environmental Laws, or any other zoning, health
or safety Law or regulation; (b) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any operator of its past or

investigation, remediation or other action with respect to Hazardous
Substances at the Leased Real Property, or any notice to or consent of
Governmental Authorities or third parties, pursuant to any applicable
Environmental Law or Environmental Permit.

5.4 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Parent shall provide each of the current employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") an opportunity to remain employed
by the Surviving Corporation, and such Company Employees who remain employed
shall continue to participate in the Employee Benefit Plans, following the
Effective Time until December 31, 2012, unless and until Parent and Mr. Benny
Madsen, Mr. Spiros Bouas and the Stockholder Representative unanimously choose
to have some or all of the Company Employees participate in one or more New
Plans. If and to the extent Company Employees are permitted to become
participants in one or more New Plans, then for purposes of vesting, waiting
period, eligibility to participate, and level of benefits under such New
Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application

 



61  would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
time. To the extent permitted under any applicable New Plan, for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and, to the extent permitted by the applicable New
Plan or otherwise practicable without adverse tax consequences, Parent shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Employee Benefit Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately before the consummation
of the Merger ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins, and overlapping with the portion of the current
plan year of such New Plan which has elapsed prior to such participation
date, to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Surviving Corporation, and their
Affiliates shall not be prohibited by this _Section 5.4_ from treating the
employees as at-will employees (subject to any contrary employment agreements
or applicable Law), or terminating or transferring or changing the terms of
the employment of any employee, or adopting, amending, or terminating any
benefit plan or other compensatory arrangement, _provided_ that until December
31, 2012 any termination (other than any terminations for cause), transfer,
change in title, responsibilities or compensation, or material reduction in
benefits must be agreed to in advance by Messrs. Madsen and Bouas and the
Stockholder Representative. No provision of this  _Section 5.4_ shall create
any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or any current or former
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.

(c) In the event that Parent terminates a Company Employee for other than
reasonable cause within seven (7) days following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause all unvested Company Options and Company SARs held by such Company
Employee and which were assumed by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(ii)_ or
_2.1(c)(iii)_ to become fully vested on the date of termination of such
Company Employee.

distribution from the Escrowed Fund) without obtaining the Stockholder

conditioned or delayed.

(iii) In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this

pursuant to _Section 1.6_ (additional payments), _Section 1.7_ (payment of
Contingent Payments) and Article 9 (indemnification) shall constitute an

Law.

 

6.13 _Operating Plan_.

(a) Following the Closing Date until the end of the Earn-Out Payment Year,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholder Representative, Mr. Madsen
and Mr. Bouas 

 



68  (each of the Stockholder Representative, Mr. Madsen and Mr. Bouas, an "
_Earn-Out Party_ ," and collectively, the " _Earn-Out Parties_ "), shall
cooperate with each other in good faith to manage and operate the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Business as a "stand-alone business" in accordance
with the specific terms of the written operating plan as agreed to by Parent
and the Company as of the date of this Agreement, as may be amended from time
to time in accordance with this _Section 6.13_ (the " _Operating Plan_ ").

(b) _Amendments to Operating Plan_. Prior to the end of the Earn-Out Payment
Year, the Operating Plan may be amended from time to time as deemed necessary
or advisable by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of the Earn-Out
Parties, upon unanimous approval of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Earn-Out Parties. If any of such parties determines it is necessary or
advisable to amend the Operating Plan, it shall prepare and deliver the
proposed amendments to the Surviving Corporation, Parent and other Earn-Out
Parties, as the case may be, and request their consideration and approval,
which consent may be withheld for any reason or no reason, except that the
Earn-Out Parties shall not withhold consent to any amendment proposed by
Parent unless such Parties believe that such amendments would make it more
difficult to achieve the Maximum Revenue Earn-out Amount or Maximum Cellular
Earn-Out Amount or less likely that the Contingent Payments will be made.

(c) _Amendment without Approval_. Prior to the end of the Earn-Out Payment
Year, if (i) Parent elects to amend the Operating Plan without having
received the consent of the Earn-Out Parties, (ii) Parent fails to provide or
reduces the resources necessary to operate the Surviving Corporation and the
Company Business consistent with the Operating Plan, or (iii) Parent elects
to divest or discontinue one or more of the Company Products and Services,
Parent shall immediately pay a one-time Contingent Payment equal to (x)
$39,000,000, _minus_  (y) the aggregate amount of any previous Contingent
Payments (including any amounts of such Contingent Payments which are set-off
or reduced pursuant to Parents rights under _Sections 1.5(c)_ and _1.7(b)_
and  _Article 9_ (indemnification) hereof), to the Paying Agent (the "
_Accelerated Earn-Out Amount_ "), and cause the Paying Agent to deliver to
each of the Participating Rights Holders, in accordance with and subject to
the exchange provisions set forth in _Section 2.2_, that portion of the
Accelerated Earn-out Amount allocable to each such Participating Rights
Holder. Such Accelerated Earn-Out Amount shall be non-refundable and deemed to
be a credit against future Contingent Payments otherwise required to be made
under _Section 1.6_, and shall reduce the obligation of Parent to pay such
Contingent Payments on a dollar-for-dollar basis until fully-exhausted.
Thereafter Parents obligations under _Sections 1.6_ and _1.7_ hereof shall
continue (including the rights of the Participating Rights Holders to receive
the Maximum Revenue Earn-Out Amount and the Maximum Cellular Earn-Out Amount
pursuant to _Sections 1.6_ and _1.7_ hereof in accordance with the terms of
such Sections, with the amount of the Accelerated Earn-Out Amount being
included in such calculations). Parent shall be entitled to amend the
Operating Plan in its discretion, subject to the provisions of this _Section
6.13(c)_ (including payment of the Accelerated Earn-Out Amount and the
potential to earn additional Contingent Payments in the event such amendment
is not consented to by the Earn-Out Parties), _ provided,_ that Parent shall
not be entitled to amend the Operating Plan without good commercial reason and
may not amend or fail to comply with the Operating Plan in an effort to reduce
the Contingent Payments. The provisions of this  _Section 6.13(b)_ shall be
the sole remedy of the Participating Rights Holders and the Earn-Out Parties
with respect to any actions of Parent as described in subsections (i)  (iii)
above.

 



69 (d) Nothing set forth in this _Section 6.13_ shall alter of change in any
way Parents obligations under _Section 5.4_ hereof.

against or made upon it for which it may seek indemnification hereunder (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party will promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party (or, if the Indemnifying Party is the Company or the
Participating Rights Holders, the Stockholder Representative (in which case
all references herein to the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to refer to
the Stockholder Representative)), of such Third-Party Claim and of its claims
of indemnification with respect thereto (which must be in the form of an
Indemnification Claim Notice under _Section 9.4_); _provided_ that failure to
promptly give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations under this _Section 9.3_, except to the extent,
if any, that the Indemnifying Party has actually been prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) Subject to paragraph (e) below, the Indemnifying Party will, upon its
written confirmation of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.5_ hereof, with respect to
such Third-Party Claim, have the right to assume the defense of the Third-
Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party by written notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty
(20) days after the Indemnifying Party has received notice of the Third-Party
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party must conduct
the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in
order to preserve its rights in this regard; and _provided further_ that the
Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense
and participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim.

 



77 (c) The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or proposed settlement
(i) includes an unconditional release of all liability of each Indemnified
Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim, (ii) involves only the payment
of money damages that, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.5_,
are fully covered by the Indemnifying Party (including amounts deemed to be
paid by the Participating Rights Holders pursuant to _Section 9.4_ by
distribution of amounts to Parent and the Surviving Corporation from escrow),
and (iii) does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed by the Indemnifying
Party).

(d) In the event that the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of
the Third-Party Claim in accordance with _Section 9.3(b)_ above, the
Indemnified Party may defend against, the Third-Party Claim in any manner it
reasonably may deem appropriate; _provided, that_ the Indemnified Party may
not settle such claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
thereto without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the Indemnified Party shall retain
all remedies to which they are entitled under this Article 9 (including
recovery against the Escrowed Funds and set-off against Contingent Payments,
if applicable), subject to the express limitations set forth herein. In such
event, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its expense, to
participate in any defense of Third-Party Claims, subject to the right of the
Indemnified Party to control such defense.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be responsible for the prosecution and defense of all claims relating to the
Intellectual Property of any Person (collectively, the " _Parent-Handled
Claims_ "), _provided, however_ , the Stockholder Representative, shall be
entitled, at its expense, to participate in any defense of such Parent-
Handled Claims, subject to the right of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
to control such defense. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pursue in
good faith, through counsel of their selection, which must be
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, the prosecution, defense or
settlement of all Parent-Handled Claims until such time, if any, that Parent
shall elect not to pursue indemnification with respect to such Third-Party
Claim, _provided, however_  Parent may not settle or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Stockholder Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying Party will remain
responsible for any Damages of Parent and the Surviving Corporation as a
result of such Parent-Handled Claims to the extent subject to indemnification
under this Article 9, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
retain all remedies to which they are entitled under this Article 9
(including recovery against the Escrowed Funds and set-off against Contingent
Payments, if applicable) with respect to Parent-Handled Claims, subject to the
limitations set forth herein.

9.4 _Notice and Payment of Claims_.

(a) _Notice of Claim_. In the event that any Indemnified Party actually incurs
Damages, or reasonably anticipates that it may incur Damages, for which it is
entitled to 

 



78  indemnification hereunder (" _Indemnifiable Damages_ "), the Indemnified
Party will deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (an "
_Indemnification Claim Notice_ ") stating that it has suffered Indemnifiable
Damages, or that it reasonably anticipates that it may suffer Indemnifiable
Damages and that the Indemnifying Party is required to provide indemnification
therefor. Such Indemnification Claim Notice shall be signed by the
Indemnified Party and shall: (a) state that such Indemnified Party has
actually paid or incurred, and/or reasonably anticipates that it may pay or
incur Damages, the actual amount or reasonably anticipated amount thereof
(the " _Claim Amount_ "), and the basis for the determination of such amount,
(b) specify in reasonable detail the individual items of Indemnifiable Damages
included in the amount so stated and the section or sections of this
Agreement pursuant to which such claim arises, the date each such item was
paid or incurred, if applicable, and the nature of the event or circumstances
which resulted in the indemnification obligation of the Indemnifying Party. 

(b) _Payment of Claim_. In order to satisfy any indemnification obligations of
the Participating Rights Holders with respect to any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Article 9, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
representatives and other Affiliates) shall have the right to
recover Indemnifiable Damages that have been incurred (i) from the Escrowed
Funds to the extent available and not already the subject of a pending claim
for indemnification pursuant to this Article 9, (ii) in connection with Set-
off Eligible Claims and in accordance with and subject to the limitations set
forth in _Sections 1.7(d)_ and _9.5_ , from amounts set-off with respect to a
claim for indemnification from any Contingent Payments. All such recoveries
from Escrowed Funds and offsets against Contingent Payments shall be made on
a _pro rata_ basis from the amount of such funds or payments otherwise
distributable to the Participating Rights Holders in the same proportions in
which they would otherwise be entitled to receive such Escrowed Funds or
Contingent Payments, except with respect to Fraud Claims which shall be paid
as set forth in _Section 9.5_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be entitled to recover any amounts directly from any of the Participating
Rights Holders, except in the case of Set-Off Eligible Claims, in which case
recovery directly from the Participating Rights Holders shall be limited to
the amounts set forth in _Section 9.5(c)_. The parties agree that to the
greatest extent possible the payment of any indemnity hereunder shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration paid by Parent hereunder
for Tax purposes.

 

9.5 _Limitations of Liability_.

(a) _Threshold_. No Participating Rights Holder will be required to indemnify
a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_, and Parent shall not
be required to indemnify the Participating Rights Holders or each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and other
Affiliates pursuant to _Section 9.1_, until such time as the aggregate amount
of determined or reasonably expected Damages for which the Parent Indemnified
Parties, on the one hand, or Participating Rights Holders or each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and other
Affiliates, as the case may be, on the other hand, are otherwise entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement exceeds $3,000,000, at which time
the applicable Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the
applicable Indemnified Party for the full amount of such Damages subject to
limitations of this Article 9\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 9.5_, the threshold limit imposed by this _Section 9.5(a)_
shall not apply to any Damages arising out of or in connection 

 



79  with (A) any breach by the Company or any Participating Rights Holders of
any Special Representations, (B) any breach by the Parent of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1_ through _4.5_ , or
(C) any Fraud Claims.

(b) _Time Limit_. All representations and warranties in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and shall expire on, and no Indemnifying Party will be
liable for any Damages hereunder with respect to a breach of such
representations and warranties unless an Indemnification Claim Notice
is given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party with respect
thereto prior to, the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Effective Time;
_provided, that_ (i) the representations or warranties in _Section
3.15_ (taxes) of this Agreement shall survive and indemnification claims may
be made under _Section 9.2(a)_ based on breaches of such representations
until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations, (ii) the
Special Representations shall survive, and indemnification claims under
_Section 9.2(a)_ based on breaches of such representations may be made,
indefinitely, subject to any applicable statutes of limitation, and (iii)
Fraud Claims may be made indefinitely, subject to any applicable statutes of
limitation. The parties acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this
Article 9 and elsewhere in this Agreement for the assertion of claims and
notices under this Agreement are the result of arms-length negotiation among
the parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed
by the parties. The parties further acknowledge that the time periods set
forth in this Article 9 and elsewhere in the Agreement may be shorter (but
may not be longer) than otherwise provided by Law.

(c) _Maximum Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of all of the
Participating Rights Holders pursuant to this Agreement, the Capitalization
and Closing Payment Amount Certificate or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not exceed the Closing Escrow Amount and shall be paid
exclusively from the Escrowed Funds; _provided_ , _however_ , that with
respect to indemnification claims (i) under  _Section 9.2(a)_ with respect
to any Special Representations or (ii) that are Fraud Claims (solely with
respect to any Participating Rights Holder who committed fraud or actually
knew of the fraudulent nature of such events, actions or circumstances
underlying such Fraud Claim) (each, a " _Set-Off Eligible Claim_ "), the
foregoing limitations shall not apply, and the aggregate liability of each
Participating Rights Holder shall in its entirety be limited to
such Participating Rights Holders _pro rata_ share of each such Set-Off
Eligible Claim, _provided_ , that the aggregate liability of such
Participating Rights Holder with respect to all of such Set-Off Eligible
Claims shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Closing Payment and
Deemed Tax Benefit (in each case, after any adjustments thereto) actually
received by such Participating Rights Holder pursuant to this Agreement,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be
required to recover the first $4,000,000 from the Escrowed Fund prior to
seeking further indemnification recourse directly against such Participating
Rights Holders.

 

9.6 _Right to Bring Action; No Contribution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Article 9 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, only the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right, power and authority to
commence any action, suit or proceeding, including any arbitration proceeding,
by and on behalf of any or all Participating Rights Holders against Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, or any other Indemnified Party, and in no event
shall any Participating Rights Holder himself, herself or itself have the
right to commence any action, suit

 



80  or proceeding, including any arbitration proceeding, against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, or any other Indemnified Party. Each Participating
Rights Holder waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such Participating
Rights Holder shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to
exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
right or remedy against Surviving Corporation in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which such Participating
Rights Holder may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement
other than any such rights provided by the Tail DandO Policy.

 

9.7 _Investigation_. The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company, the
Participating Rights Holders or the Stockholder Representative in this
Agreement, or any document, certificate or other instrument required to be
delivered by the Company, the Participating Rights Holders or the
Stockholder Representative under this Agreement shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted by any Indemnified Party or any other Person at any
time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by any
Indemnified Party or any other Person at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to
the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.
