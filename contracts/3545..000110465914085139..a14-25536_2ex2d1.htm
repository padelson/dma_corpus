 **Section 2.7** ** ****_1031 Exchange_**. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that Purchaser intends to acquire certain assets of the Partnership at the
Closing in a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code, and Purchaser
shall be entitled to require the Partnership to dispose of the assets
identified by Purchaser (the " _Identified Assets_ ") simultaneously with the
Closing in such a like-kind exchange transaction and in the manner set forth
in this _Section 2.7_. Each of the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
structure such transactions as, or as part of, a "deferred like-kind exchange"
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1031(k)-1 or a "reverse like-kind
exchange" pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2000-37, or otherwise, to the
greatest extent possible under the Code and agrees to make such modifications
to this Agreement as are reasonably necessary to meet the requirements of
Section 1031 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
In such connection, Purchaser shall be entitled to require the Partnership to
transfer the Identified Assets at Closing to, and the Partnership shall at the
Closing transfer the Identified Assets to, a qualified intermediary, as
defined in Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the regulations promulgated under the
Code, an exchange accommodation titleholder, as defined in Revenue Procedure
2000-37, or another person reasonably selected by Purchaser for the purpose of
satisfying the Section 1031 requirements (each, an " _Accommodator_ ").
Purchaser shall be entitled to satisfy any payments required to be made
pursuant to this Agreement by directing

 



      
 

 



 

an Accommodator to make such payments to the Partnership, and any payments so
made to the Partnership shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person receiving such payment from such Accommodator.
The Partnership shall be entitled to direct that any payments required to be
made pursuant to this Agreement be made to an Accommodator, and any payments
so made to such Accommodator shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Partnership. Purchaser agrees to
cooperate with the Partnership in connection with the Partnerships desire to
sell certain assets of the Partnership at the Closing in a like-kind exchange
transaction that meets the requirements of Section 1031 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. None of the representations,
warranties, covenants, indemnification obligations or other agreements of the
Parties hereunder shall be affected by any transfer of assets to or receipt of
assets from an Accommodator pursuant to the foregoing terms of this _Section
2.7_. None of the Parties shall be required to make any representations or
warranties, assume any obligations, spend any out-of-pocket amounts, or
acquire title to any property, except as required by this Agreement, in
connection with an exchange involving an Accommodator effected by the other
Party. Each of the Parties hereby agrees to pay all costs incurred by such
Party associated with any such exchange effected by such Party and to
indemnify and hold each of the other Parties harmless from and against any and
all claims, losses, liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees, court
costs and related expenses) and Taxes arising out of such exchange.

 



 

 **Section 2.8** ** ****_Closing Adjustment_**. The Parties acknowledge that
the Partnership has delivered to Purchaser at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the date hereof a good-faith estimate of the Closing Adjustment
Amount (such estimate, the " _Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount_ ") and each
of its component parts (such component parts, together with the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Amount, the " _Estimated Amounts_ "), which statement
contains an estimated balance sheet of the Partnership as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions
contemplated herein), a calculation of the Estimated Amounts (the " _Closing
Statement_ "), reasonable supporting detail and a certificate of the
Partnership that the Closing Statement was prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. The Partnership has provided Purchaser with reasonable
access to the books and records of the Partnership, and other Partnership
documents, to verify the information set forth in the Closing Statement prior
to the Closing Date. The Estimated Amounts set forth in the Closing Statement
shall be the Estimated Amounts for the purposes of the Closing.

 



 

 **Section 2.9** ** ****_Purchaser Deliverables_**. At the Closing, Purchaser
shall deliver or cause to be delivered the following:

 **Section 2.11** ** ****_Non-Assignment; Consents_**. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer or convey any Purchased
Asset for which any requisite approval, authorization, consent or clearance
of, filing or registration with, notification to, or granting or issuance of
any license, order, ruling, waiver or permit by, any Person (collectively, "
_Approvals_ " and with respect to Approvals of Governmental Entities, the "
_Governmental Approvals_ ") has not been obtained prior to the Closing. If
such Approval is not obtained prior to the Closing, until the earlier of such
time as such Approval or Approvals are obtained and three (3) years following
the Closing Date, then (i) each of Purchaser and the Partnership shall
cooperate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
Approval or Approvals and (ii) the Partnership will cooperate with Purchaser
in any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and the Partnership
(each, a " _Workaround_ ") intended to both (x) provide Purchaser, or
Affiliates of Purchaser designated by Purchaser, to the fullest extent

(including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing
arrangement) and (y) cause Purchaser, or such designated Affiliates of
Purchaser, to bear all costs and Liabilities thereunder to the extent an
Assumed Liability from and after the Closing in accordance with this Agreement
to the extent that Purchaser, or such designated Affiliates of Purchaser,
receives the rights and benefits of such Purchased Assets from and after the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Purchaser will, or will cause its applicable Affiliates to, promptly pay,
perform or discharge when due any related Liability to the extent it
constitutes an Assumed Liability arising thereunder after the Closing to the
extent that Purchaser, or such designated Affiliates of Purchaser, receives
the rights and benefits of such Purchased Assets from and after the Closing in
accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall not be
obligated by this _Section 2.11_ to assume or incur any Liability that is
inconsistent with the Partnerships or its Affiliates representations,
warranties and other covenants contained in this Agreement. Purchaser shall be
solely responsible for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
implementing any Workaround. If an Approval for the sale, transfer, assignment
or conveyance of a Purchased Venture Interest has not been obtained at the
Closing, then in addition to the Workaround described in this _Section 2.11_,
Purchaser may instruct the Partnership in writing to offer to purchase any or
all of the Venture Equity Interests that are not Purchased Venture Interests
from the holders thereof at the purchase price set forth in such notice

 



      
 

 



 

(such purchase, a " _Venture Purchase_ ," and such notice, a " _Venture
Purchase Notice_ "). Upon the Partnerships receipt of a Venture Purchase
Notice, the Partnership and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to negotiate with the other holders of the Venture Equity Interests
and, with Purchasers prior written approval, execute and consummate the
Venture Purchase described therein; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall be
solely responsible for the cost of consummating the Venture Purchase and will
reimburse the Partnerships reasonable and documented costs of negotiating the
Venture Purchase, if any.

 



 

 **Section 2.12** ** ****_Indemnification Escrow_**.

 



 

(a) The Escrow Deposit Amount, or from and after the Closing the Remaining
Escrow Deposit Amount, shall (subject to the terms and conditions of _Article
6_) serve as and be the sole and exclusive source for payment of claims for
indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to _Article 6_. The
Escrow Letter of Credit, which shall be provided at the Closing by Purchaser
to the Escrow Agent in respect of the Escrow Deposit Amount, shall be held by
the Escrow Agent in an account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ ") in
accordance with the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

 



 

(b) On the date which is twelve (12) months following the Closing, the Escrow
Agent shall pay and disburse to the Partnership, via a draw on the funds
available under the Escrow Letter of Credit, the Initial Indemnity Release
Amount calculated in accordance with _Section 2.13_, and the amount available
to be drawn under the Escrow Letter of Credit and the aggregate principal
amount of the Escrow Letter of Credit shall be reduced to reflect the
foregoing draw and payment.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement to
the contrary, in the event that the Partnership is entitled, pursuant to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to funds to be drawn from the Escrow
Letter of Credit and the Escrow Agent is not able to draw all or any part of
such funds from the Escrow Letter of Credit after receiving a notice
(formatted as a joint written instruction) directing it to draw and release
such funds, whether due to the expiration of the Escrow Letter of Credit,
technical draw issues or otherwise, then, and in any such event, Purchaser
shall deliver to the Partnership, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, not later than three (3) business days (with time of the essence) after
a written request therefor from the Partnership, the amount of funds to which
the Partnership is entitled or, if less than such amount, the remaining amount
available to be drawn under the Escrow Letter of Credit, and the amount
available to be drawn thereafter under the Escrow Letter of Credit (if not
already equal to Zero) shall be reduced by the amount of such wire transfer.
Without limiting the forgoing, any inability of the Escrow Agent to draw upon
the Escrow Letter of Credit for any amount that is properly payable to the
Partnership from the Escrow Letter of Credit or the Indemnity Escrow Account
pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall not relieve the
Purchaser from its obligation to have made or to make such payment to the
Partnership, and the Purchaser shall effect such payment by wire transfer in
accordance with the preceding sentence.

 



 

(d) If either Purchaser or the Partnership anticipates that there will be any
funds remaining under the Escrow Letter of Credit as of the expiration date of
the Escrow Letter

 



      
 

 



 

of Credit (the " _Escrow L/C Expiration_ "), then Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to the Escrow Agent, at least
three (3) business days prior to the Escrow L/C Expiration, a replacement
clean, irrevocable and unconditional standby letter of credit in the aggregate
face amount equal to the amount of funds remaining under the Escrow Letter of
Credit (i) in substantially the same form as the Escrow Letter of Credit or
such other form as is reasonably acceptable to the Partnership and the Escrow
Agent and (ii) from the then-current lender under the Escrow Letter of Credit
or such other lender as is reasonably acceptable to the Partnership (the "
_Replacement Letter of Credit_ "). The Escrow Agreement shall provide that if
the Escrow Agent has not received a Replacement Letter of Credit from
Purchaser and written notice from the Partnership that the Replacement Letter
of Credit satisfies the requirements of this _Section 2.12(d)_ at least six
(6) business days prior to the Escrow L/C Expiration, then prior to the close
of business on the third (3rd) business day prior to the Escrow L/C Expiration
(with time of the essence), the Escrow Agent shall draw all funds remaining
under the Escrow Letter of Credit and hold such funds in the Indemnity Escrow
Account for release pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Escrow
Agreement (a " _Full Draw Event_ "). Following the expiration of the Escrow
Letter of Credit, all references in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to
the Escrow Letter of Credit shall be deemed to refer to the Replacement Letter
of Credit (and any subsequent replacement standby letter of credit that
complies with this _Section 2.12(d)_), and this _Section 2.12(d)_ shall
apply to the Replacement Letter of Credit _mutatis mutandis_.

 



 

(e) The Parties agree that the Escrow Agreement shall treat the Escrow Letter
of Credit and any funds held in the Indemnity Escrow Account as owned by the
Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 



 

 **Section 2.13** ** ****_Release of Indemnity Escrow_**.

 



 

(a) On the date which is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the "
_Initial Indemnity Release Date_ "), Purchaser shall provide the Partnership
with (i) a written notice of its reasonable and good-faith determination of
the Projected Indemnity Amount, if any, as of such date, together with
reasonable supporting calculations and documentation, and (ii) a written
notice and instruction (formatted as a joint instruction also to be executed
by the Partnership) duly executed by Purchaser instructing the Escrow Agent to
draw down that portion of the funds available under the Escrow Letter of
Credit and pay to the Partnership, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, an amount equal to the greater of (A) Zero Dollars ($0) and (B)
(x) the funds available under the Escrow Letter of Credit or otherwise held in
the Indemnity Escrow Account as of that date _minus_ (y) Three Million Seven
Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($3,750,000) _minus_ (z) the Projected
Indemnity Amount as of such date (such amount, the " _Initial Indemnity
Release Amount_ "). Any such payments by the Escrow Agent shall be made to the
Partnership. The term " _Projected Indemnity Amount_ " means, as of any date,
the sum of Losses that, as of such date, would reasonably be expected to be
paid out of the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to, and subject to the
conditions and limitations provided under, _Article 6_ in respect of claims
that have been timely and properly asserted in good faith in accordance with
_Article 6_ but not finally resolved by such date.

 



 

(b) On the Survival Period Termination Date, Purchaser shall provide the
Partnership with (i) a written notice of its reasonable and good-faith
determination of the Projected Indemnity Amount, if any, as of such date,

if any, of the Escrow Letter of Credit, if any, pursuant to _Section
2.12(b)_) and pay to the Partnership, in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement, an amount equal to the greater of (A) Zero Dollars ($0) and
(B) (x) the remaining funds available under the Escrow Letter of Credit or
otherwise held in the Indemnity Escrow Account as of that date _minus_ (y) the
Projected Indemnity Amount as of such date (such amount, the " _Subsequent
Indemnity Release Amount_ "). Any such payments by the Escrow Agent shall be
made to the Partnership.

 



 

(c) As and to the extent any claim included and described in the definition of
the Projected Indemnity Amount as of the Initial Indemnity Release Date or the
Survival Period Termination Date, as applicable (each such claim, a "
_Projected Indemnity Claim_ "), is subsequently withdrawn or resolved,
Purchaser and the Partnership shall issue joint written instructions directing
the Escrow Agent to pay to the Partnership via a draw on the funds available
under the Escrow Letter of Credit or otherwise held in the Escrow Account such
amount as is due to the Partnership from the Indemnity Escrow Account or
effect an Escrow Principal Reduction in the amount as is due to the Purchaser
Indemnitees, as applicable, in accordance with the resolution of such claim,
as provided in the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , that the amount drawn on the
funds available under the Escrow Letter of Credit and released from the
Indemnity Escrow Account to the Partnership upon the resolution of a Projected
Indemnity Claim (a " _Projected Indemnity Release Amount_ ") shall be reduced
(but not below Zero Dollars ($0)) as follows:

 



 

(i) Prior to the Survival Period Termination Date, such amount shall be
reduced to the extent that (A) the Remaining Escrow Deposit Amount at such
time is less than (B) (1) the Interim Projected Indemnity Amount at such time
_plus_ (2) Three Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars
($3,750,000); and

 



 

(ii) Following the Survival Period Termination Date, such amount shall be
reduced to the extent that (A) the Remaining Escrow Deposit Amount at such
time is less than (B) the Remaining Projected Indemnity Amount at such time.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Interim Projected Indemnity Amount_ " means, as of the time a Projected
Indemnity Claim is withdrawn or resolved, (x) the Projected Indemnity Amount
as of the Initial Indemnity Release Date _minus_ (y) Purchasers reasonable
and good faith estimate of Losses, as of the Initial Indemnity Release Date,
with respect to Projected Indemnity Claims to be finally resolved and paid
following such date.

 



 

(ii) " _Remaining Escrow Deposit Amount_ " means, as of the time a Projected
Indemnity Claim is withdrawn or resolved, (x) the remaining funds available
under the Escrow Letter of Credit or otherwise held in the Escrow Account as
of immediately prior to such time _minus_ (y) the amount as is due to the
Purchaser Indemnitees in accordance with the resolution of such Projected
Indemnity Claim.

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) " _Remaining Projected Indemnity Amount_ " means, as of the time a
Projected Indemnity Claim is withdrawn or resolved, (x) the Projected
Indemnity Amount as of the Survival Period Termination Date _minus_ (y)
Purchasers reasonable and good faith estimate of Losses, as of the Survival
Period Termination Date with respect to Projected Indemnity Claims to be
finally resolved and paid following such date.

 



 

(e) Following the withdrawal or resolution of all Projected Indemnity Claims
outstanding as of the Survival Period Termination Date, Purchaser and the
Partnership shall issue joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent
to pay to the Partnership, via a draw on the funds available under the Escrow
Letter of Credit, the principal amount remaining under the Escrow Letter of
Credit, if any, and any other funds held in the Escrow Account.

 **Section 2.14** ** ****_Post-Closing Adjustment_**.

 



 

(a) No later than ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser will
cause to be prepared and delivered to the Partnership a statement setting
forth its calculation of the Closing Balance of Inventories, the Employee
Leasing Cost, the Closing Balance of Inventories Adjustment and the Closing

of the Partnership, as of the opening of business on the Closing Date (without
giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein) (the " _Post-Closing
Statement_ "), reasonable supporting detail and a certificate of Purchaser
that the Post-Closing Statement was prepared in accordance with Accounting
Principles.

 



 

(b) Within forty-five (45) days following receipt by the Partnership of the
Post-Closing Statement, the Partnership shall deliver written notice to
Purchaser of any dispute the Partnership has with respect to the calculation,
preparation or content of the Post-Closing Statement (the " _Dispute Notice_
"); _provided_ , that if the Partnership does not deliver any Dispute Notice
to Purchaser within such forty-five (45) day period, the Post-Closing
Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The Dispute
Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail (i) any item on the Post-Closing
Statement that the Partnership disputes and (ii) the correct amount of such
item; _provided_ , that the Partnership may not dispute the accounting
principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in preparing the Post-
Closing Statement unless they are not in accordance with the Accounting
Principles. Upon receipt by Purchaser of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and the
Partnership shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute set forth
therein. If Purchaser and the Partnership fail to resolve any such dispute
within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice (the " _Dispute
Resolution Period_ "), then Purchaser and the Partnership jointly shall
engage, within ten (10) business days following the expiration of the Dispute
Resolution Period, Grant Thornton or, if Grant Thornton is unavailable or

Partnership (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve any such
dispute; _provided_ , that, if Purchaser and the Partnership are unable to
agree on the Independent Accounting Firm, then Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Partnership, on the other hand, shall each select a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm, and the two (2) firms will mutually select a
third nationally recognized independent accounting firm to serve as the
Independent Accounting Firm. As promptly as practicable, and in any event not
more than fifteen (15) days following the engagement of the Independent
Accounting Firm, Purchaser and the Partnership shall each prepare and submit a
presentation detailing each Partys complete statement of proposed resolution
of each issue still in dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm. Purchaser
and the Partnership shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to, as soon
as practicable after the submission of the presentations described in the
immediately preceding sentence and in any event not more than twenty (20) days
following such presentations, make a final determination, binding on the
Parties to this Agreement, of the appropriate amount of each of the line items
that remain in dispute as indicated in the Dispute Notice. With respect to
each disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance with the
position of either Purchaser or the Partnership, shall not be in excess of the
higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Purchaser or the
Partnership, as applicable, in their respective presentations to the
Independent Accounting Firm described. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be limited to whether any disputed determinations of the Post-Closing
Statement and each of its components were properly calculated in accordance
with the Accounting Principles. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if
any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally
by Purchaser (on the one hand) and the Partnership (on the other hand). All
determinations made by the Independent Accounting Firm, and the Post-Closing
Statement, as modified by the Independent Accounting Firm, will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties. The Parties agree that any adjustment
as determined pursuant to this _Section 2.14(b)_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law.

 



 

(c) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this _Section
2.14_, each of Purchaser and the Partnership shall reasonably cooperate with
each other in good faith and make available to each other and their respective
Representatives all information, records, data and working papers, in each
case to the extent related to the Partnership and its subsidiaries, and shall
permit access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required
in connection with the preparation and analysis of the Post-Closing Statement
and the resolution of any disputes thereunder.

 



 

(d) If the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount _minus_ the finally determined
Closing Adjustment Amount (such difference, which may be a positive or a
negative number, the " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ ") is a negative number, the
Purchaser and the Partnership shall within three (3) business days of the
final determination of the Closing Adjustment Amount issue joint written
instructions directing the Escrow Agent to effect an Escrow Principal
Reduction in an amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing
Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, Purchaser
shall within three (3) business days of the final determination of the Closing
Adjustment Amount, pay to the Partnership an amount of cash equal to the Post-
Closing Adjustment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the Partnership.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 2.15** ** ****_Withholding Rights_**. Each of the Escrow Agent and
Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent amounts are so withheld by the Escrow Agent or Purchaser, as the case
may be, and paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made.

Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein.

Purchased Assets is not an indicator of future performance and that no
representations

 



      
 

 



 

or warranties of any nature or kind are being made by the Partnership or its

 **ARTICLE 5 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

 



 

 **Section 5.1** ** ****_Public Announcements_**. Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Partnership, on the other hand, shall consult with one another and
obtain one anothers approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld

each Party may make any such announcement which it in good faith believes,
based on advice of counsel, is necessary or advisable in connection with any
requirement of Law, it being understood and agreed that, to the extent
permitted and practicable,

 



      
 

 



 

each Party shall provide the other Parties with copies of any such
announcement in advance of such issuance.

 



 

 **Section 5.2** ** ****_Employee Leasing_**.

 



 

(a) _Provision of Leased Employees_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this _Section 5.2_, the Partnership shall furnish to Purchaser during the
Employee Leasing Term the services of the Current Business Employees to
perform the functions and services that were performed by the Current Business
Employees as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Leased
Employees_ "). All Leased Employees shall perform their usual and customary
functions for a period not to exceed the Employee Leasing Term. During the
Employee Leasing Term, the Partnership shall (i) use its reasonable efforts to
cause each of the Leased Employees to continue to be employed by the
Partnership and (ii) direct each of the Leased Employees to continue to
provide to the Partnership the services and perform the functions that such
individual provided to the Partnership immediately prior to the Closing Date
(together with reasonable modifications of such functions in the ordinary
course of business as requested by Purchaser).

 



 

(b) _Status of Leased Employees_. Leased Employees providing services to
Purchaser under this _Section 5.2_ shall at all times during the Employee
Leasing Term remain employees of the Partnership. Purchaser shall have the
right to request that the Partnership remove any Leased Employee as a service
provider to the Purchaser. The Partnership shall have the ultimate authority
to make all hiring and termination decisions with respect to the Leased
Employees; _provided_ , that the Partnership shall make reasonable efforts to
accommodate Purchasers needs and desires in operating the Business. The
Partnership shall retain the sole and exclusive right to select, evaluate,
hire, promote, discipline and terminate all Leased Employees.

 



 

(c) _Standard of Performance_. The Partnership shall perform its obligations
under this _Section 5.2_ in a manner consistent with the same level of
diligence and care it has heretofore used with respect to the Business prior
to the Closing.

 



 

(d) _Cessation as Leased Employee_. If any Leased Employee ceases to be an
employee of the Partnership during the Employee Leasing Term, such individual
shall automatically cease to be a Leased Employee for purposes of this
_Section 5.2_ , the Partnership shall have no obligation to replace such
individual under this _Section 5.2_ and Purchaser shall have no obligation to
extend an offer of employment to such individual under _Section 5.3(a)_.

 



 

(e) _Compensation and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(i) Throughout the Employee Leasing Term, all Leased Employees shall be on the
payroll, and participate in the employee benefits programs, of the Partnership
and its Affiliates. The Partnership shall (A) pay or provide to each Leased
Employee all salaries, wages and benefits due to each Leased Employee during
the Employee Lease Term, which salaries, wages and benefits shall be
consistent with those paid or made available to the Leased Employees
immediately prior to the Closing; (B) withhold all amounts that are required
to be withheld under all applicable Law from amounts paid to any Leased
Employee and pay such amounts to the appropriate federal, state or local
taxing authority; (C) comply with all provisions of Law applicable with
respect to the payment of wages or benefits to the Leased Employees including,

 



      
 

 



 

without limitation, any Law pertaining to the amount or payment of wages, any
Law requiring that Leased Employees be provided with health care coverage and
any Law requiring the provision of workers compensation; (D) maintain in
effect for Leased Employees any and all insurance and similar coverages
(including, without limitation, workers compensation, unemployment and
disability insurance) that are required to be maintained for employees by Law;
and (E) comply with all applicable Laws respecting employment and employment
practices with respect to each of the Leased Employees.

 



 

(ii) During the Employee Leasing Term, except as required by applicable Law or
as consented to by Purchaser in writing, the Partnership shall not, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates not to, (A) increase or decrease the compensation
or benefits payable or to become payable to any Leased Employee, (B) pay or
award, or commit to pay or award, any bonuses or incentive compensation to any
Leased Employee, or (C) take any action to accelerate any payment or benefit,
or the funding of any payment or benefit, payable or to become payable to any
Leased Employee.

 



 

(f) _Relationship of the Parties_. The Partnership and Purchaser shall provide
each other with all such information and materials reasonably necessary to
effect the Partnerships and Purchasers prompt and complete performance of
their duties and obligations under this _Section 5.2_. The Partnership and
Purchaser agree that they shall cooperate with each other and shall act in
such a manner as to promote the prompt and efficient completion of the
obligations under this _Section 5.2_. Each party shall maintain the
confidentiality of all information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 5.2_.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
herein shall be construed as giving Purchaser primary direction or control
over the Leased Employees or the time, location, manner or method in which
they perform the services hereunder. The parties stipulate and agree that (i)
the Partnership and each Leased Employee is an independent contractor with
respect to its, his or her duties to Purchaser; (ii) this _Section 5.2_
identifies the work to be performed by the Partnership, but does not reserve
to Purchaser primary direction or control in the time, location, manner or
method in which such services are to be performed; and (iii) Purchaser shall
not exercise and shall have no right to designate which services are to be
performed by particular Leased Employees. This _Section 5.2_ sets forth
results to be achieved by the Partnership and standards to be satisfied by it,
but does not create the relationship of an employer and employee as between
Purchaser and the Leased Employees. During the Employee Leasing Term, all
Leased Employees shall be and remain employees of the Partnership and may be
disciplined, transferred or discharged only by the Partnership. Neither the
Partnership nor Purchaser shall represent to any party that any Leased
Employee is an employee of Purchaser, or that such Leased Employees
relationship to Purchaser is other than that of an independent contractor. The
Partnership shall obtain and keep in force at all times during the Employee
Leasing Term liability insurance coverage on the same terms and conditions as
maintained by the Partnership prior to the Closing (" _Liability Insurance
Coverage_ ") relating to the acts, omissions or employment of all Leased
Employees, including general liability and workers compensation, as though the
Leased Employees had remained assigned to a facility operated by the
Partnership. Purchaser shall obtain all necessary property and casualty and
other liability coverage with respect to the premises at which the Leased
Employees perform services, and with respect to any acts, omissions or the use
of Leased Employees as is prudent under the circumstances.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Indemnification_. Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Partnership Indemnitees from and against and in respect of any Losses of
any nature or kind whatsoever suffered or paid by any such Partnership
Indemnitee as a result of, in connection with, or arising out of (i) the
furnishing of Leased Employees contemplated by this _Section 5.2_, or (ii)
otherwise relating to, resulting from, arising out of or based upon the
employment of the Leased Employees during the Employee Leasing Term, including
Losses relating to employment litigation or actions taken or omitted to be
taken by Leased Employees in the workplace, in the course of their employment
or otherwise; _provided_ , that the Partnership Indemnitees shall not be
entitled to such indemnification for any such Losses resulting from, arising
out of or based on the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any such
Partnership Indemnitees or any such Partnership Indemnitees breach of any of
the covenants contained in this _Section 5.2_. The Partnership agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees from and against
and in respect of any Losses of any nature or kind whatsoever suffered or paid
by any such Purchaser Indemnities as a result of, in connection with, or
arising out of the Partnerships or its Affiliates breach of any of the
covenants contained in this _Section 5.2_. The Losses for which Purchaser or
the Partnership has agreed to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Partnership Indemnitees or the Purchaser Indemnitees, as applicable, pursuant
to this _Section 5.2(g)_ are referred to as " _Employee Leasing Losses_."
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the
indemnification provided in this _Section 5.2(g)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy for Employee Leasing Losses (other than the Parties rights
to seek equitable relief pursuant to _Section 7.13_) and shall survive the
Closing indefinitely without any limitations on the indemnification
obligations of Purchaser or the Partnership hereunder (other than the
limitations contained in _Section 6.7_).

 



 

 **Section 5.3** ** ****_Employee Benefit Matters_**.

 



 

(a) As of the Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser shall offer, or cause its
applicable Affiliate to offer, employment to each Current Business Employees
who is employed by the Partnership as of the Employee Transfer Date (subject
to _Section 5.3(c)_ , other than any such individual who, as of the Employee
Transfer Date, is receiving short- or long-term disability benefits or on
workers compensation leave, military leave, leave of absence under the Family
Medical Leave Act or other leave of absence approved by the Partnership or its
Affiliates) on terms consistent with this _Section 5.3_. Each such Current
Business Employee who accepts Purchasers offer of employment pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(a)_ and actually commences employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates, and each such Current Business Employee who accepts an offer of
employment from Purchaser in accordance with _Section 5.3(c)_ and actually
commences employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates, shall be referred to
herein as a " _Transferred Employee_." Except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, from and after the Employee Transfer Date, (A) the Partnership and its
Affiliates shall retain all Liabilities under Partnership Benefit Plans and
(B) subject to _Section 5.2(g)_, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not have
any Liability with respect to any Business Employee who does not become a
Transferred Employee. From the date hereof through the Employee Transfer Date,
the Partnership shall use reasonable best efforts to encourage Current
Business Employees who are employed by the Partnership as of the Employee
Transfer Date to accept employment offers from Purchaser or any of its
applicable Affiliates as contemplated by this _Section 5.3_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Effective as of the Employee Transfer Date (or such later date as set
forth in _Section 5.3(c)_), the Transferred Employees shall cease active
participation in each Partnership Benefit Plan. The Partnership and its
Affiliates shall retain all assets and Liabilities for the Business Employees
under the Partnership Benefit Plans, including all Liabilities for eligible
claims for benefits under the Partnership Benefit Plans that are welfare plans
that are incurred by the Transferred Employees on or prior to the Employee
Transfer Date. From and after the Employee Transfer Date, Transferred
Employees will be offered participation and coverage under Purchasers and its
subsidiaries compensation and benefit plans, whether written or unwritten,
including each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA (the " _Purchaser Benefit Plans_ ") to the extent applicable, which are
provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its subsidiaries
from time to time. For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and
accrual of benefits under the Purchaser Benefit Plans providing benefits to
any Transferred Employees after the Employee Transfer Date (the " _New Plans_
"), each Transferred Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Partnership and its subsidiaries before the Employee Transfer
Date, to the same extent as such Transferred Employee was entitled, before the
Employee Transfer Date, to credit for such service under any similar
Partnership Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Employee Transfer Date,
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply (i) with respect to benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, (ii) for purposes of any New
Plan under which similarly-situated employees of Purchaser and its
subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service, (iii) for purposes of
any New Plan that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of
benefits or participation, or (iv) to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to
the extent legally permissible, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts: (A) to cause each Transferred Employee to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a
Partnership Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated
immediately before the Employee Transfer Date (such plans, collectively, the "
_Old Plans_ "), and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, life insurance and/or vision benefits to any
Transferred Employee, to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable Old Plans of the Partnership or its subsidiaries
in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Employee Transfer
Date.

 



 

(c) If any Current Business Employee who, as of the Employee Transfer Date, is
employed by the Partnership but is receiving short- or long-term disability
benefits or on workers compensation leave, military leave, leave of absence
under the Family Medical Leave Act or other leave of absence approved by the
Partnership or its Affiliates is, within six (6) months following the Employee
Transfer Date, able to return to work, Purchaser shall offer employment to
such employee on terms consistent with those applicable to Transferred
Employees generally under this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

(d) Effective as of the Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser shall establish
participation by the Transferred Employees in Purchasers tax-qualified
defined contribution plan (the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_") for the benefit of
each Transferred Employee who, as of immediately

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Employee Transfer Date, was eligible to participate in a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the Partnership or its
Affiliates (collectively, the " _Partnership 401(k) Plans_"). As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Employee Transfer Date, the Partnership shall
cause the Partnership 401(k) Plans, to the extent permitted by Section
401(k)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, to make distributions available to Transferred
Employees, and for not less than six (6) months following the Employee
Transfer Date, Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept any
such distribution (excluding loans) as a rollover contribution (including by
way of a direct transfer) if so directed by the Transferred Employee.

 



 

(e) The Partnership and its Affiliates shall retain any Liability in respect
of, and indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates for, any benefits payable to
Business Employees who do not become Transferred Employees, unless their
failure to become Transferred Employees results from a breach of Purchasers
obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Without limiting the generality of _Section 7.8_, the provisions of this
_Section 5.3_ are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no current or
former director, officer, employee or any other individual associated
therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of
this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall guarantee employment
for any period of time or preclude the ability of Purchaser to terminate the
employment of any Transferred Employee at any time and for any reason, or
constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any compensation or benefit
plan, policy, agreement or arrangement of Purchaser, the Partnership or their
respective subsidiaries for any purpose.

 



 

 **Section 5.4** ** ****_Certain Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) After the Closing Date, the Partnership and Purchaser shall cooperate, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, with each other and with
each others agents, including accounting firms and legal counsel, in
connection with Tax matters relating to the Business and the Purchased
Ventures including (i) the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns, (ii)
determining the liability for and amount of any Taxes due or the right to and
amount of any refund of Taxes, (iii) examinations of Tax Returns and (iv) any
administrative or judicial proceedings in respect of Taxes assessed or
proposed to be assessed. Such cooperation shall include the Partnership and
Purchaser making available to each other all information and documents in
their possession relating to the Business and the Purchased Ventures. The
Partnership and Purchaser also shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, make available to each other, as reasonably requested and
available, personnel responsible for preparing, maintaining and interpreting
information and documents relevant to Taxes. Any information or documents
provided pursuant to this _Section 5.4(a)_ shall be kept confidential by the
Party receiving the information or documents, except (x) as may otherwise be
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in connection with
any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to Taxes, or (y) as
required by Law or to employees, advisors or consultants of the Partnership,
in each case who have a need to know such information, _provided_ that such
Persons either (A) agree to observe the terms of this _Section 5.4(a)_ or (B)
are bound by obligations of confidentiality to the Partnership of at least as
high a standard as those imposed on the Partnership under this _Section
5.4(a)_. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, neither
Purchaser nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide to any
Person any Tax Return (or copy thereof) of Purchaser or any consolidated,
combined or unitary group that includes Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) The parties agree that any amounts payable to the Partnership, as
increased by any Assumed Liabilities, as adjusted to reflect such other
relevant items, as determined by the parties in good faith, shall be allocated
among the Purchased Assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the manner
required by Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, and in accordance with the agreed Property Purchase Price
Allocation and parcel break-out contained in _Section 5.4(b)_ of the
Partnership Disclosure Schedules (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "). No later
than ninety (90) days after the finalization of the finally determined Post-
Closing Adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.14_, the Partnership shall deliver
to Purchaser an allocation of the Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 2.14_ (and all other relevant amounts) among the Purchased Assets in
accordance and consistent with the Allocation Schedule (the " _Draft
Allocation_ "). In the event Purchaser disagrees with the Draft Allocation,
Purchaser may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Draft Allocation,
deliver a notice to such effect (the " _Purchaser Allocation Notice_ ") to the
Partnership, specifying those items as to which Purchaser reasonably disagrees
and setting forth Purchasers proposed allocation of the Purchase Price, as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.14_ (and all other relevant amounts). If
Purchaser does not timely deliver the Purchaser Allocation Notice, the Draft
Allocation shall become final. If the Purchaser Allocation Notice is duly
delivered, the Partnership and Purchaser shall, during the twenty (20) days
following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the
allocation of the Purchase Price (and all other relevant amounts). If the
Partnership and Purchaser are unable to resolve the dispute within the twenty
(20)-day period following the delivery of the Purchaser Allocation Notice,
then the matter will be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm to
resolve the dispute, but in any event such resolution by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be consistent with the Allocation Schedule. Any
allocation of the Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.14_ (and
all other relevant amounts) and any other items that are treated as additional
consideration for Tax purposes determined pursuant to the decision of the
Independent Account Firm shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the
Allocation Schedule. Each of the Partnership and Purchaser shall be
responsible for one-half of the fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm under this _Section 5.4(b)_. The allocation as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 5.4(b)_ (the " _Allocation_ ") shall be
appropriately adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect any payments made
hereunder for federal income tax purposes and any indemnity payments made
pursuant to _Section 5.2(g)_ or _Article 6_. The parties shall (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to) report the relevant federal, state,
local and other tax consequences of the purchase and sale contemplated under
this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Allocation. None of the parties
or any of their respective Affiliates shall take any position inconsistent
with the Allocation on any Tax Return or in connection with any Tax
proceeding, in each case, except to the extent required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law).

 



 

(c) If a Third Party Claim includes or would reasonably be expected to include
both a claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes and a claim for Taxes that are
not Excluded Taxes, and such claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes is not
separable from such a claim for Taxes that are not Excluded Taxes, Partnership
(if the claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes exceeds or reasonably would be
expected to exceed in amount the claim for Taxes that are not Excluded Taxes)
or otherwise Purchaser (Partnership or Purchaser, as the case may be, the "
_Controlling Party_ ") shall be entitled to control the defense of such third
party claim (such third party claim, a " _Tax Claim_ "). In such case, the
other party (Partnership or Purchaser, as the case may

 



      
 

 



 

be, the " _Non-Controlling Party_ " shall be entitled to participate fully (at
the Non-Controlling Partys sole expense) in the conduct of such Tax Claim and
the Controlling Party shall not settle such Tax Claim without the consent of
such Non-Controlling Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
The costs and expenses of conducting the defense of such Tax Claim shall be
reasonably apportioned based on the relative amounts of the Tax Claim that are
Excluded Taxes and that are not Excluded Taxes

 



 

(d) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the procedures
relating to claims for indemnification for Taxes shall be governed exclusively
by this _Section 5.4_, and the provisions of _Section 6.3_ (other than
_Section 6.3(d)_ ) shall not apply in respect thereto. The covenants,
agreements and indemnification obligations in this _Section 5.4_ and _Section
6.2(b)(iv)_ shall survive the Closing until the date that is thirty (30) days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

 



 

(e) The Partnership, its subsidiaries and Purchaser shall cooperate in filing
all required sales, use, transfer and other Tax returns and ancillary
documents in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Purchaser shall pay and be responsible for 100% of all
documentary stamp and other transfer taxes (including intangible taxes) that
may be imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on account of any Purchased Real Property.

 



 

 **Section 5.5** ** ****_Payoff Letters_**. The parties hereto acknowledge
that the Partnership has caused Prudential to deliver to Purchaser, and
Purchaser has obtained from MetLife and Rabobank customary payoff letters, or
equivalent documentation with respect to each of the Partnership Credit
Facilities (other than the Citree Loan) and the Working Capital Facility in
substantially final form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser
(each, a " _Payoff Letter_ "), which Payoff Letters together with any related
release documentation, among other things, include the payoff amount (the "
_Payoff Amount_ ") and provide, among other things, that all Liens and
guarantees granted in connection therewith relating to the assets, rights and
properties of the Partnership, its subsidiaries and the Owners securing such
Indebtedness and any other obligations secured thereby, shall be, upon the
payment of the amount set forth in the applicable payoff letter at or prior to
the Closing be released and terminated. Concurrently with the Closing,
Purchaser will cause the Partnership Credit Facilities (other than the Citree
Loan) and the Working Capital Facility to be paid and satisfied in full and
will further cause the Owners to be released from any and all guaranty
obligations of such Owners with respect to each of the Partnership Credit
Facilities and the Working Capital Facility.

 



 

 **Section 5.6** ** ****_Title Insurance_**. If at the Closing Purchaser has
not obtained such ALTA owners extended coverage policies of title insurance
(with all requested endorsements, " _Title Insurance_ ") with respect to the
Owned Real Property and such of the Leased Real Property as Purchaser may
determine is necessary or advisable to include in such policies of title
insurance, in each case insuring Purchasers title subject to no Liens other
than Permitted Liens and with all standard exceptions deleted, issued by a
national title insurance company selected by Purchaser (the " _Title Insurer_
"), the Partnership and its subsidiaries shall cooperate with Purchaser
following the Closing in obtaining such Title Insurance from the Title
Insurer. Without limiting the foregoing, the Partnership and its subsidiaries
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver the Title Documentation and shall
provide access to and information concerning the Purchased Real Property

 



      
 

 



 

to the Representatives of the Title Insurer and surveyors, all at no cost or
expense to Purchaser. The premiums for the Title Insurance and all
endorsements thereto shall be the sole responsibility of the Purchaser.

 



 

 **Section 5.7** ** ****_Delivery of Financial Statements_**. The
Partnership, at the sole cost and expense of the Purchaser to the extent the
same are not prepared in the ordinary course of business of the Partnership,
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Purchaser the
financial statements for the Business that are required to be filed by
Purchaser in connection with the Closing pursuant to Regulation S-X
promulgated under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (such
Act, the " _Exchange Act_ ," and such Regulation, " _Regulation S-X_ "), and
the Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver such
financial statements to be delivered at least ten (10) business days prior to
the time that Purchaser is required to file such financial statements pursuant
to the Exchange Act in connection with the Closing. Such financial statements
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, and fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership
and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and for the periods
covered thereby, in conformity with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods covered thereby, except as may be noted therein.

 



 

 **Section 5.8** ** ****_Settlement of Accounts_**. Except as set forth in
_Section 5.8(b)_ of the Partnership Disclosure Schedules, each of the Owners
and the Partnership shall cause, on or prior to the Closing, (i) all Contracts
between or among the Partnership and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
any Related Party, on the other hand (other than any such Contract with any
Purchased Venture) and (ii) all other Liabilities of the Business to any
Related Party of the Partnership or a Partnership subsidiary (other than any
such Liability to a Purchased Venture) to be terminated, in each case for no
additional value and without any Liability of Purchaser or the Business after
the Closing Date.

 



 

 **Section 5.9** ** ****_Further Assurances; Misallocated Assets_**.

 



 

(a) From time to time, as and when requested by any Party and at such Partys
expense, any other Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions as such requesting Party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent that any Owner or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Partnership and its subsidiaries) holds

shall cause such Person to, promptly transfer such assets to the Partnership
or its subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date or to Purchaser at the
Closing by executing an instrument of assignment or transfer pursuant to
_Section 2.10_.

 



 

(b) The Partnership and the Owners acknowledge and agree that all Minerals,
Mineral Rights and Ancillary Property Rights now, formerly or in the future
shall be, and are intended to be, transferred to Purchaser as part of the
Transaction. If, following the date hereof, any Minerals, Mineral Rights and
Ancillary Property Rights are found to have been retained by or shall revert
to or otherwise shall be possessed by the Partnership, the Owners or any of
their Affiliates, either directly or indirectly, then in any such event the
Owners shall, promptly and without notice or demand, assign, transfer and
convey to Purchaser or its designee unconditionally and absolutely all right,
title and interest owned by the Partnership, the Owners or any of their

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates in and to such Minerals, Mineral Rights and Ancillary Property
Rights by appropriate instruments (in proper form for recording at the request
of Purchaser), without any consideration and without any cost, fee or expense
to Purchaser, other than the payment of any documentary stamp or other
transfer Taxes, if any, payable in connection therewith, which documentary
stamp or other transfer Taxes shall be the sole responsibility of the
Purchaser.

 



 

(c) If, following the Closing, any right, property or asset not forming part
of the Business is found to have been transferred to Purchaser in error,
either directly or indirectly, Purchaser shall transfer, or shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Purchased Ventures) to transfer, at no cost to the
Partnership (or its designated Affiliate), such right, property or asset (and
any related Liability) as soon as practicable to the Partnership (or such
designated Affiliate). If, following the Closing, any right, property or asset
forming part of the Business is found to have been retained by the Partnership
or any of its Affiliates in error, either directly or indirectly, the
Partnership shall transfer, or shall cause its Affiliates to transfer, at no
cost to Purchaser other than documentary stamp or other transfer Taxes, such
right, property or asset (and any related Liability) as soon as practicable to
Purchaser or an Affiliate (including a Purchased Venture) indicated by
Purchaser.

 



 

 **Section 5.10** ** ****_Payments_**.

 



 

(a) The Partnership shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to,
promptly pay or deliver to Purchaser (or its designated Affiliates) any monies
or checks to the extent they are related to the Business or the Purchased

the Closing Date by customers, suppliers or other contracting parties of the
Business or the Purchased Ventures to the extent that they are in respect of a
Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability hereunder.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, promptly pay

Owners or their Affiliates shall have the right to use the Orange-Co Name and

extent that such use would not otherwise constitute a violation of Purchasers
and its Affiliates rights in the Orange-Co Name and Orange-Co Marks under
applicable Law.

Termination Date, other than (a) the Partnership Fundamental Representations,
which shall survive indefinitely or until the expiration of the applicable

_Section 6.1_.

 



       
 

 



 

 **Section 6.2** ** ****_Exclusive Remedy; General Indemnification_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that their (and each of their) sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all claims, Actions, causes of action, suits or
litigation (of every kind and description) in respect of any breach or

indemnification provisions set forth in _Section 5.2(g)_ and this _Article
6_. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 6.2(a)_, nothing in this

to seek any remedy on account of the common law fraud of any Party hereto, in
the event such Party is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to

the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article 3_ or
_Article 4_ (as applicable) of this Agreement or any certificate or other
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement (a " _Fraud Determination_ ").

 



 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article 6_, after the Closing,
the Partnership shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser and/or its
respective officers, directors, employees and/or agents (each a " _Purchaser
Indemnitee_ ") harmless from any damages, losses, liabilities, obligations,
Taxes, claims or causes of action of any kind, interest or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) (each a " _Loss_ ") suffered or paid
as a result of, in connection with, or arising out of (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty (A) contained in _Article 3_ or (B) in any

representation or warranty (A) contained in _Article 4_ or (B) in any
certificate signed and delivered by Purchaser to the Partnership or the Owners

 **Section 6.3** ** ****_Procedures_**.

 



 

(a) If a claim, Action, suit or proceeding (including a claim, Action, suit or
proceeding by a Person who is not a Party or an Affiliate thereof, such claim,
Action, suit or proceeding being referred to as a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is
made or threatened in writing to be made against any Person entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 5.2(g)_ or _Section 6.2_ (an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), and if such Person intends to seek indemnity with
respect thereto under _Section 5.2(g)_ or this _Article 6_, such Indemnified
Party shall promptly give a Notice of Claim to the Party obligated to
indemnify such Indemnified Party under _Section 5.2(g)_ or _Section 6.2_ (such
notified Party, the " _Responsible Party_ "); _provided_ , that the failure to
give such Notice of Claim shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its
indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Responsible Party is materially prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt of a Notice of Claim for a Third Party Claim, the Responsible
Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to assume the
control of and conduct, through counsel chosen by the Responsible Party at the
expense of the Responsible Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith with the Responsible Party
in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the Responsible Party shall permit
the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense through
counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party (the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party unless, in the opinion of
counsel, representation of both the Responsible Party and the Indemnified
Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional care due to actual or potential conflicts of interest as between
such parties, in which case the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the
Indemnified Party shall be borne by the Responsible Party). So long as the
Responsible Party is reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to pay or settle any such claim; _provided_ , that in such
event it shall waive any right to indemnity or reimbursement therefor by the
Responsible Party or from the Indemnity Escrow Account, as the case may be,
for such claim unless the Responsible Party shall have consented to such
payment or settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If the Responsible Party does not notify the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys Notice of
Claim hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the
Indemnified Party, acting reasonably and in good faith, shall have the right
to contest, settle or compromise the claim and shall not thereby waive any
right to indemnity or reimbursement therefor pursuant to this Agreement
(subject to the applicable conditions and limitations provided in this
_Article 6_).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to
liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional
release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in
connection with such Third Party Claim and the Responsible Party desires to
accept and agree

 



      
 

 



 

to such offer, the Responsible Party shall give written notice to that effect
to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party does not consent to such
firm offer within a reasonable period of time after its receipt of such
notice, the Indemnified Party may elect to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the Responsible Party
as to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement
offer. If the Indemnified Party so fails to consent to such firm offer and
also fails to assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Responsible Party may resolve and settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms
set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. The Responsible
Party shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), enter into any
settlement except as set forth in this _Section 6.3(c)_.

 



 

(d) With respect to any Notice of Claim by an Indemnified Party relating to a
Loss which does not arise out of or result from a Third Party Claim (a "
_Direct Claim_ "), the Responsible Party shall have thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During such
thirty (30)-day period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the Responsible
Party and its Representatives to investigate the matter or circumstance
alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any
amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim. If the Responsible Party
does not so respond within such thirty (30)-day period, the Responsible Party
shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified
Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto,
including incurring costs only to the minimum extent such Indemnified Party
determines in good faith is reasonably necessary to remedy, cure or respond to
the consequences of the breach, default or non-compliance that gives rise to
such Loss.

 



 

(f) The Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate
in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim to ensure the proper
and adequate defense thereof, and shall reasonably cooperate with respect to
any Direct Claim, in each case in respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder and each (or a duly authorized Representative of such Party) shall

or nature, whether express or implied, including in the Partnerships due
diligence investigation, or in any presentation of the business of Purchaser

except for the representations and warranties specifically included in

Agreement or in any certificate or document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Partnership expressly disclaims any reliance on any
representations or warranties of any kind or nature, whether express or
implied, including in Purchasers due diligence investigation (including with

 **Section 6.6** ** ****_Additional Indemnification Provisions and
Limitations_**.

 



 

(a) With respect to each indemnification obligation contained in this
Agreement, the amount of any and all Losses shall be determined net of any
amounts actually recovered by the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Partnership
Indemnitees, as applicable, under insurance policies or other collateral
sources (such as contractual indemnities of any Person which are contained
outside of this Agreement) with respect to such Losses.

 



 

(b) To the extent that any Partnership Indemnitee is entitled to any
indemnification payment pursuant to _Section 5.2(g)_ or this _Article 6_
(including pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_), Purchaser shall deliver such
payment to the Partnership, on behalf of such Partnership Indemnitee, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Partnership within ten (10) days of the determination of the amount of such
indemnification payment. If the Partnership has not received such payment at
the expiration of such ten (10)-day period, then Purchaser and the Partnership
shall instruct the Escrow Agent (via appropriate, irrevocable joint written
instructions pursuant to the Escrow Agreement) to draw down the Escrow Letter
of Credit (or otherwise release funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account) in an
aggregate principal amount equal to such payment and deliver such amount to
the Partnership, on behalf of such Partnership Indemnitee, from the Indemnity
Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, up to the full
amount of the Remaining Escrow Deposit Amount, and the Purchaser shall remain
liable for any shortfall in the indemnification payment amount if the amount
paid from the Indemnity Escrow Account is less than the amount due.

 



 

(c) To the extent that any Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled to any
indemnification payment pursuant to _Section 5.2(g)_ or this _Article 6_,
including pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_, Purchaser and the Partnership shall
instruct the Escrow Agent via appropriate, irrevocable joint written
instructions pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to effect an Escrow Principal
Reduction (or, following a Full Draw Event, the release of funds from the
Indemnity Escrow Account) in an amount equal to such payment; _provided_ ,
that if any Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled to any indemnification

 



      
 

 



 

payment pursuant to _Section 5.2(g)_, _Section 6.2(b)(ii)_ or _(iv)_ or
under _Section 6.2(b)(i)_ (solely for indemnification payments in respect of
Fundamental Representation Losses) then Purchaser may in its sole discretion
(i) instruct the Escrow Agent to satisfy such payment through an Escrow
Principal Reduction (or release of funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account) as
set forth above or (ii) instruct the Partnership to satisfy such payment by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Partnership within ten (10) days of the determination of the amount of such
indemnification payment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (A) the sole and exclusive source of recovery with respect to any
claim for indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnitee under _Section
6.2(b)(i)_ shall be, and shall be limited to an Escrow Principal Reduction
(or, following a Full Draw Event, the release of funds from the Indemnity
Escrow Account), in an aggregate amount equal to the indemnification payment
to which such Purchaser Indemnitee is entitled under (and subject to the
conditions and limitations under) this _Article 6_, and (B) neither the
Partnership, nor the Owners, nor any Affiliate of the Partnership or the
Owners, shall be responsible or liable for any indemnification payment under
_Section 6.2(b)(i)_ , and the Purchaser and all Purchaser Indemnitees shall be
entitled to look solely and exclusively to an Escrow Principal Reduction (or,
following a Full Draw Event, the release of funds from the Indemnity Escrow
Account) as the source of satisfying any such payment; _provided_ , that
indemnification payments in respect of Fundamental Representation Losses shall
not be subject to the limitations set forth in this sentence. Notwithstanding
the foregoing in this _Section 6.6(c)_ (but subject to _Section 7.14_ ), the
Partnership shall be liable for any shortfall in any indemnification payment
amount due to a Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 5.2(g)_ , _Section
6.2(b)(i)_ (solely for indemnification payments in respect of Fundamental
Representation Losses) or _Section 6.2(b)(ii)_ , _(iii)_ or _(iv)_ if and
solely to the extent that the amount of such payment due to such Purchaser
Indemnitee cannot be satisfied by an Escrow Principal Reduction or otherwise
by funds available in the Indemnity Escrow Account.

 



 

 **Section 6.7** ** ****_Limitation on Damages_**. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, no Party shall be liable for, and Losses
shall not include, any consequential damages, including loss of revenue,
income or profits, Loss in value of assets or securities, punitive, special,
incidental or indirect damages, arising out of or relating to any breach or
violation of, or any non-compliance with, any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation included in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto, except (a) in the case of a Fraud
Determination against such Party or (b) to the extent awarded against an
Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article 6_ in connection with a Third Party
Claim; _provided_ , that the above provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall not
prevent Purchaser Indemnitees from recovering "interest, penalties and
additions to tax" as those terms are described in the definition of "Tax" in
_Section 1.1_.

 



 

 **Section 6.8** ** ****_Tax Treatment_**. All indemnification payments
pursuant to this _Article 6_ (including any funds released from the Indemnity
Escrow Account to Purchaser or to the Partnership) shall be treated for all
Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price, except to the extent
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local
or foreign Law).

 



       
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 7 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **Section 7.1** ** ****_Entire Agreement; Assignment_**. This Agreement,
together with the schedules and exhibits hereto, and the Ancillary Agreements
(a) constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and (b) except pursuant to _Section 2.7_, shall not be
assigned by any Party (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, in the case of the Partnership, or the
Partnership, in the case of Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
Purchaser may assign its rights hereunder to any of its wholly owned
subsidiaries without consent; _provided_ , that no such assignment shall
relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder, and, (ii) following the
Closing Date, each of Purchaser and any permitted assignee may assign its
rights and obligations hereunder without consent in connection with a sale of
all or substantially all of Purchasers assets, as long as the transferee
assumes Purchasers obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment of this
Agreement not in accordance with the terms of this _Section 7.1_ shall be
void. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser, the Partnership and the
Owners expressly acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, (A) if the
Partnership merges or consolidates with or into any other Person, whether in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions, the Partnerships
rights and obligations under this Agreement shall be automatically assigned
and delegated to the surviving entity in such merger or consolidation, and (B)
if the Partnership dissolves or liquidates, whether in a single transaction or
a series of related transactions, the Partnerships post-closing rights and,
subject to _Section 7.14_, obligations (if any), under this Agreement shall
be assigned and delegated pro rata to the Partnerships equity holders or, at
the Partnerships option, to the Partnerships Affiliates in such portions as
the Partnership determines in its sole discretion ( _provided_ that all of the
Partnerships obligations shall be assigned and delegated to such equity
holders and/or Affiliates). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, but subject to _Section 5.2_, from and following the Employee
Transfer Date, the Partnership and the Owners shall be free to, and nothing
herein shall or shall be deemed to limit or restrict its or their ability to,
dissolve itself or themselves under applicable law, pay-off their liabilities
and liquidate their assets.

 



 

 **Section 7.2** ** ****_Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended or
modified only by a written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized
officers of Purchaser and the Partnership. This Agreement may not be amended
or modified except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and any
amendment by any Party effected in a manner which does not comply with this
_Section 7.2_ shall be void.

 



 

 **Section 7.3** ** ****_Notices_**. All notices, requests, claims, demands
and other communications hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all
purposes hereunder if in writing and delivered by hand, courier or overnight
delivery service, or five (5) days after being mailed by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, with appropriate postage prepaid,

intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in
any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not

shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its
