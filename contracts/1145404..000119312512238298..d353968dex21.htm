 TABLE OF CONTENTS

_The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by the parties
thereto. A party s representations and warranties were made solely for the
benefit of the other party or parties and (i) were not intended to be treated
as categorical statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk
to the party or parties making the representation and warranty if it proves to
be inaccurate; (ii) may have been qualified in the Merger Agreement by
disclosures that were made to the other party or parties in connection with
the negotiation of the Merger Agreement (provided that any specific facts that
contradict the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement in any
material respect have been disclosed); (iii) may apply contract standards of
"materiality" that are different from "materiality" under the applicable
securities laws; and (iv) were made only as of the date of the Merger

thereof, be cancelled and extinguished, and will be converted into only the
right to receive payment in cash, without interest, as set forth in this
_Section 2.2(a)_ and payable in the manner provided in _Section 2.6_. Each
holder of a Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the date
thereof shall automatically become entitled, for each share as to which that
Company Option was exercisable,

 



-13-   without regard to any vesting provisions (each, an " _Option Share_ "), to
the right (each, the " _Participation Right_ ") to receive the following
amounts:

 

(i) Upon the distribution of the Closing Merger Consideration, each holder of
a Participation Right shall receive an amount, if any (the " _Initial Option
Cancellation Amount_ "), for each Participation Right equal to the positive
excess of the Per-Participation Rights Merger Consideration as of such date
over the Exercise Price of such Participation Right (the " _Option Spread_
"). If the Option Spread (calculated without regard to whether the excess of
the Per-Participation Rights Merger Consideration as of such date minus the
Exercise Price of such Participation Right is positive) is zero or negative,
then the holder of the Participation Right shall receive no payment from the
Closing Merger Consideration on account of such Participation Right.

 

(ii) Upon the distribution of any Merger Consideration after the Effective
Time, (each, a " _Secondary Distribution_ "), each holder of a Participation
Right shall receive an amount, if any, for each Participation Right equal to
the positive excess of the Per-Participation Rights Merger Consideration as of
the date of such Secondary Distribution over the sum of (x) the Exercise
Price of such Participation Right, _plus_ (y) the Initial Option Cancellation
Amount, _plus_ (z) any previous Secondary distributions under this _Section
2.2(a)(ii)_ with respect to such Participation Right (collectively, the
"Secondary Option Spread"). If the Secondary Option Spread (calculated without
regard to whether the excess of the Per-Participation Rights Merger
Consideration as of such date minus the sum of (x), (y) and (z) in the
previous sentence) is zero or negative, then the holder of the Participation
Right shall receive no payment from the Closing Merger Consideration on
account of such Participation Right. Notwithstanding the above, no amounts
shall be payable under this _Section 2.2(a)(ii)_ after the fifth anniversary
of the Effective Time and any such amounts that would otherwise be payable
hereunder but for this sentence shall be distributed as additional Common
Stock Per Share Merger Consideration.

(iii) The parties hereto agree that any Tax deduction for the Initial Option
Cancellation Amount shall be allocable to the Companys Pre-Closing Tax Period
and that the parties shall not take a Tax reporting position on any Tax Return
inconsistent with the same (including the application of the "next day rule"
as described in Treas. Reg. §1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)).

(b)  _Withholdings_. The Company (for the Initial Merger Consideration) and
the Surviving Corporation (for all Secondary Distributions) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Participation Right otherwise payable to any
Company Holder such amount that the Company or the Surviving Corporation is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other
Law. The Company or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly pay or cause to
be paid any amounts withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.2(b)_ for applicable
Taxes to the appropriate Governmental Entity on behalf of such holder of a
Participation Right. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,

 



-14-   such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the applicable holder of Participation Rights. For all Tax
purposes, the compensation deduction resulting from the Initial Merger
Consideration paid to the holders of Participation Rights shall be treated as
an expense of the Company incurred prior to the Effective Time and all
Secondary Distributions shall be treated as an expense of the Surviving
Corporation.

(c) _Resolutions_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Companys Board of Directors and any committee administering
the Company Option Plan will adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
as may be required or appropriate to effect the provisions of _Section 2.2_,
including ensuring that the Company provides all notices required under the
terms of each Company Option.

(d) _Restricted Shares_. Each share of Common Stock granted subject to
vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan
(collectively, " _Restricted Shares_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of such restrictions as of
the Effective Time and at the Effective Time the holder thereof shall, subject
to this _Article II_ , be entitled to receive the Common Stock Per Share
Merger Consideration with respect to each such Restricted Share, less any
required withholding Taxes.

Section 2.3. _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, any Shares which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and are held by a Person (a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of or consented to the
adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of Shares to require appraisal
of their Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, and the holders of such
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the
DGCL to holders of Dissenting Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect
or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses its right of appraisal, in any case
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, its Shares shall be deemed to
be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, without interest, for each such Share in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. At the Effective Time, any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL and as
provided in the previous sentence. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal of Shares received by the Company, withdrawals
of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by applicable Law,
make any payment with respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights or
offer to settle any such rights.

Mellon National Association (" _BNY Mellon_ ") to act as exchange agent for

Participation Rights in connection with the Merger (the " _Agent_ ").
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall deposit or shall
cause to be deposited sufficient funds to pay the Adjusted Closing Merger
Consideration, and (ii) the Company shall deposit or shall cause to be
deposited an amount equal to the Estimated Closing Cash, in each case with
the Agent in the same separate account established for the benefit of the
holders of Shares, (such deposits in clauses (i) and (ii), together with any
funds added thereto pursuant to _Section 2.10(d)_,  _Section 2.11(a)_ or
_Article IX_ , the " _Payment Fund_ "). The parties acknowledge and agree that
the Companys deposit of the Estimated Closing Cash amount with the Agent
shall be deemed for all purposes hereunder, effective as of the Closing, to
constitute partial payment of the Closing Merger Consideration by Parent. The
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, pay all of the Merger
Consideration out of the Payment Fund, when and if payable pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. The Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed
by Parent on a daily basis in (i) short term direct obligations of the United
States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days, (ii)
short term obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and
interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating
from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors; _provided_
, that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former
holders of Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Nothing in this _Section 2.4_ shall limit
the ability of the Agent to make any required Tax withholdings permitted by 
_Section 2.9_ or to limit the Surviving Corporations ability to make any
such required Tax withholdings after any funds remaining in the Payment Fund
have been returned to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Agreement.
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as expressly
provided in this Agreement.

(b) _Escrow_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with BNY Mellon (the "
_Escrow Agent_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Working Capital and Severance Escrow Amount,
each of which shall be held in separate segregated accounts. At any time, the
amount of cash held by the Escrow Agent related to the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, together with the proceeds thereof, shall constitute the " _Indemnity
Escrow Fund_ " and the amount of cash held by the Escrow Agent related to the
Working Capital and Severance Escrow Amount, together with the proceeds
thereof, shall constitute the " _Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund_ ",
in each case to be governed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and an escrow agreement in substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit C_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), among Parent, the Escrow Agent and
the Stockholder Representative. The adoption of this Agreement by the
Majority Stockholders Consent shall constitute approval of the Escrow
Agreement and of all of the arrangements relating thereto.

(c) _Stockholder Representative Expense Fund_. At the Closing, Parent shall
deposit with the Agent the amount of the Stockholder Representative Expense
Fund. Subject to  _Section 9.4(d)(vii)_, all deposits to and withdrawals
from the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund shall be made by the
Stockholder Representative.

 



-16-  Section 2.5. _Payment of Cash for Shares_. The Company shall make available
to each Person it expects to be a record holder, as of the Effective Time, of
an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") a form of letter
of transmittal and instructions (in the form and substance of a letter of
transmittal and instructions to be mutually agreed by the Company and Parent
prior to the Effective Time) for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates. Each such holder shall be entitled upon surrender of one or
more Certificates, together with a letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, to receive in exchange
therefor the applicable Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificate and such Certificate shall then be cancelled.
Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such Certificate shall, after the
Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the right to receive such amount.
If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer, with the registered owners signature guaranteed by
a firm which is a member of a registered national securities exchange or of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or by a commercial bank or trust
company having an office or correspondent in the United States, and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent or the Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is
not payable. Promptly following the date which is twelve (12) months after
final payment of Merger Consideration required hereunder, the Agent shall
deliver to the Surviving Corporation all cash, certificates and other
documents in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and the Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of
a Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares and
Certificates representing Cancelled Shares) may surrender such Certificate to
the Surviving Corporation and (subject to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law) receive in consideration therefor the amount to which
such holder is entitled as of such time, without any interest thereon. The

Surviving Corporation to, provide the Stockholder Representative with access
upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times to the relevant books and
records and employees and independent accountants (subject to execution of a
customary independent accountant access letter) of the Company and the
Operating Company in connection with the Stockholder Representatives review
of the Post-Closing Statement and the Adjustment Statement, together with the
workpapers used in their preparation and shall furnish the Stockholder
Representative with any other information reasonably requested relating to the

Representative (the " _Objection Statement_ ") on or prior to the thirtieth
(30th) calendar day after its receipt of the Post-Closing Statement and the
Adjustment Statement, the Stockholder Representative and the Company Holders
shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Post-Closing Statement and
the Adjustment Statement and such agreement shall be final and binding on the
parties. Any items on the Post-Closing Statement or Adjustment Statement as to
which the Stockholder Representative has not given notice of its objection on
the Objection Statement shall be deemed to have been agreed upon by the
parties. If the Stockholder Representative so notifies Parent of its
objections to any of the Post-Closing Statement or the Adjustment Statement
and provides Parent with the Objection Statement, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall, within thirty (30) calendar days following the notice,
which period may be extended by written agreement of Parent and the
Stockholder Representative (such period, as it may be extended, the "
_Resolution Period_ "), attempt to resolve their differences. Any resolution
by Parent and the Stockholder Representative during the Resolution Period as
to any disputed amounts shall be reduced to writing and shall be final,
binding and conclusive. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company Holders shall
be deemed to have accepted and agreed to any such resolution reached between

the parties in writing, be submitted within thirty (30) calendar days after
the expiration of the Resolution Period to Deloitte LLP or such
other independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Parent and the
Stockholder Representative (the " _Neutral Accounting Arbitrator_ "). The
Neutral Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to determine only
those items in dispute, and for each such item shall determine a value within
the range of values submitted therefor by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative in the Post-Closing Statement and Objection Statement. All fees
and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral
Accounting Arbitrator shall be allocated between Parent, on the one hand, and
the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of all of the Company Holders), on
the other hand, in the 

 



-21-   same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted
to the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator that is unsuccessfully disputed by such
party (as finally determined by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator) bears to
the total amount of such disputed items so submitted. Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall direct the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator to
deliver to Parent and the Stockholder Representative a written determination
(such determination to include a work sheet setting forth all material
calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on
information provided to the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator by the
Stockholder Representative and Parent) of the disputed items within thirty
(30) calendar days of receipt of the disputed items, which determination shall
be final, binding and conclusive. The final, binding and conclusive Post-
Closing Statement and Adjustment Statement, which either are agreed upon by
Parent and the Stockholder Representative (including a deemed agreement under
_Section 2.10(b)_) or are delivered by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator in
accordance with this  _Section 2.10_ shall be the " _Conclusive Statement_ "
and the " _Conclusive Adjustment Statement_ ," respectively. In the event that
either Parent or the Stockholder Representative fails to submit its
statement regarding any items remaining in dispute within the time determined
by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator, then the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator
shall render a decision based solely on the evidence timely submitted to the
Neutral Accounting Arbitrator by Parent and the Stockholder Representative.

(d) _Post-Closing True-Up_.

 

(i) If the Adjustment Amount as shown on the Conclusive Adjustment Statement
is a negative number, then the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the Working
Capital and Severance Escrow Fund (and, to the extent the Working Capital and
Severance Escrow Fund is insufficient, the Indemnity Escrow Fund) an amount
in cash equal to such Adjustment Amount.

(ii) If the Adjustment Amount as shown on the Conclusive Adjustment Statement
is a positive number, then Parent shall pay to the Agent an amount in cash
equal to such Adjustment Amount for inclusion in the Payment Fund and for
payment of the applicable Merger Consideration.

 

(iii) All payments to be made to the Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.10(d)_
shall be made on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which
Parent and the Stockholder Representative agree to, or the Neutral Accounting
Arbitrator delivers, the Conclusive Statement and the Conclusive Adjustment
Statement.

 

(e) _Tax Treatment of True-Up Payments_. All payments made in respect of the
Adjustment Amount shall be treated as an adjustment to the Initial Merger
Consideration for Tax purposes.

(f) _Indemnification Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the determination of the Conclusive Statement and the
resulting Adjustment Amount shall not preclude Parent or the Stockholder
Representative, as the case may be, from pursuing indemnification for the
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant pursuant to _Article IX_
or any matters otherwise indemnifiable thereunder.

 



-22-  (g) _Severance Payments_. Any amounts remaining in the Working Capital and
Severance Escrow Fund after the true-up payments pursuant to subsection (d)
have been made shall be available to pay the Excess Severance Amounts,
together with the employers share of FICA with respect thereto, pursuant to 
_Section 6.11(a)(ii)_. Within thirty (30) calendar days after the twelve (12)
month anniversary date of the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative
a statement (the " _Severance Statement_ ") setting forth the aggregate
Excess Severance Amount (including FICA) paid or remaining to be paid to
Offered Employees, net of any portion of the Excess Severance Amount paid by
the Company prior to the Effective Time. After receipt of the Severance
Statement, the Stockholder Representative, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall have the same rights of review, examination of books and
records, dispute process and neutral accounting arbitration process as are
applicable to the Adjustment Statement and the Post-Closing Statement pursuant
to _Section 2.10(b)_ and _(c)_ above. The aggregate Excess Severance Amount
(together with the employers share of FICA with respect thereto) determined
in accordance with this process shall be paid from the Working Capital and
Severance Escrow to Parent. After such payment, the amount remaining in the
Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund shall be distributed by the
Stockholder Representative to the Company Holders.

Section 2.11. _Contingent Payments_. 

(a) _Contingent Payments_. In addition to the payment made by Parent pursuant
to _Section 2.4(a)_, after the Effective Time and subject to _Section 9.8_,
Parent shall make the following non-refundable cash payments (each, a "
_Contingent Payment_ "), which shall be deposited into the Payment Fund for
payment to the Company Holders, subject to the satisfaction of the respective
milestones (each, a "Milestone") and _Section 2.11(c)_:

(i) $4,000,000 payable within ten (10) Business Days after Relaunch Approval
of RV (the " _RV Relaunch Approval Milestone Payment_ ");

 

(ii) $2,000,000 (the " _Decision Payment_ ") payable on or before the first
anniversary of the Relaunch Approval of RV (regardless of whether there is an
Affirmative RV Decision or a Negative RV Decision) _plus_ , within 45 days
after the end of the First RV Sales Year, the First RV Sales Year Milestone
Payment;

 

(iii) If Parent made an Affirmative RV Decision, the Second RV Sales Year
Milestone Payment, payable within 45 days after the end of the Second RV
Sales Year; and

Milestone Payment, payable within 45 days after the end of the Third RV Sales
Year.

(i) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to, use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain Relaunch Approval for RV. " _Commercially
Reasonable Efforts_ " as used in this _Section 2.11(b)_ means, with respect
to the efforts to be expended by Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) in connection with Relaunch Approval for RV,
commercially reasonable and good faith efforts and resources that are of a
substantially similar level of effort and resources that specialty
pharmaceutical companies of size and resources comparable to those of Parent
typically exercise to obtain launch approval of their own drug candidates.

(ii) On or immediately prior to the first anniversary of the date of the
Relaunch Approval, Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative of its
decision, made in good faith, to either (a) discontinue all commercial
activities with respect to RV (a " _Negative RV Decision_ ") or (b) continue
to commercialize RV (an " _Affirmative RV Decision_ "). In the event that
Parent makes a Negative RV Decision, the Stockholder Representative shall
have an option to purchase from Parent, RV, together with all rights, title
and interest of Parent or any Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
in RV, including any inventory of RV owned by Parent or any Affiliate
(including the Surviving Corporation), for an amount equal to $4,000,000 plus
the Decision Payment, if paid by Parent pursuant to subsection (a)(ii) (the "
_RV Option_ "). Parent shall provide the Stockholder Representative with
copies of all agreements or other evidence of liabilities which would be
assumed upon exercise of the RV Option by the Stockholder Representative in
order to afford the Stockholder Representative the opportunity to complete
due diligence. In the event that the Stockholder Representative desires to
exercise the RV Option, the Stockholder Representative shall notify Parent
within sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of written notice of Parents
Negative RV Decision. In connection with the exercise of the RV Option, the
Stockholder Representative shall also assume any and all liabilities and
obligations of Parent or any of its Affiliates related to RV existing on the
date of the repurchase. Upon the occurrence of a Negative RV Decision by
Parent, Parent shall have no further right to commercialize RV, including no
right to sell or license RV or any Intellectual Property primarily related
thereto to any Third Party for the purpose of commercialization or otherwise,
regardless of whether or not the Stockholder Representative has decided to
exercise the RV Option; provided that in the event that Parent makes a
Negative RV Decision and the Stockholder Representative does not exercise the
RV Option, and during the pendency of the Stockholder Representatives
decision whether to exercise the RV Option, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be permitted to sell existing RV inventory or assets and
shall continue to pay to Stockholder Representative an amount equal to
twenty-five percent (25%) of any Net Sales of RV or proceeds from the sale of
those assets, as the case may be; provided, further, however, that in no event
shall the total of all amounts paid under this final sentence of _Section
2.11(b)(ii)_, together with all amounts paid under _Section 2.11(a)_, exceed
$25,000,000.

 



-24-  (c) _Audit Rights_.

 

(i) Until the end of the Second RV Sales Year (the " _Audit Period_ "), and
thereafter as needed for any audit requested during the Audit Period, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation)
to, keep such complete and accurate books and records as may be necessary to
ascertain the amounts of any payments owed hereunder. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall include provisions in all of its agreements
entered into after the Effective Time and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts with respect to its existing agreements to cause Selling Persons to
maintain books and records consistent with that required under this _Section
2.11(c)(i)_ by Parent and its Affiliates. During the Audit Period, Parent
shall provide an annual report within sixty (60) calendar days after
the close of the First RV Sales Year and, in the event Parent makes an
Affirmative RV Decision, Second RV Sales Year, as applicable, summarizing (A)
Net Sales, on a country-by-country basis, during such period, (B) the "gross
to net" adjustments with respect to the calculation of Net Sales for such
period, on a country-by-country basis, and (C) the amount of each Contingent
Payment and the calculation thereof.

 

(ii) Upon the written request of the Stockholder Representative, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to,
permit an independent public accountant (the " _Independent Auditor_ ")
selected by the Stockholder Representative and reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, at the expense of the Company Holders (to be paid through the Working
Capital and Severance Escrow Fund or Indemnity Escrow Fund or otherwise caused
to be paid by the Stockholder Representative solely on behalf of the Company
Holders), to have reasonable access solely in response to a request
made during the Audit Period, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal
business hours, but no more than once during any calendar year, to inspect the
records specified in _Section 2.11(c)(i)_ for the purpose of determining the
accuracy of the amounts of any payments owed hereunder. If the Independent
Auditor concludes that any Contingent Payment was underreported for any
reporting period by more than ten percent (10%), Parent shall within ten (10)
Business Days thereafter pay the amount of such underreported Contingent
Payment plus the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of the audit to the
Stockholder Representative. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
include provisions in all of its agreements entered into after the Effective
Time and shall use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to its
existing agreement to provide Parent with inspection rights consistent with
those provided to the Stockholder Representative under this  _Section
2.11(c)(ii)_.

(iii) Any nonpublic records, data, results, reports and other
information granted access to or disclosed by Parent, its Affiliates, or any
other Selling Person pursuant to this _Section 2.11(c)_ shall be treated in
accordance with _Section 6.6(b)_.

shall maintain or cause to be maintained for the benefit of each Continuing
Employee, other than Terminating Employees (" _Offered Employees_ "), a level
of base compensation equal to such Continuing Employees base compensation
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If any Offered Employee becomes
entitled during the twelve (12) months after the Effective Time to payment of
the Excess Severance Amount, the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of

be made by Parent after consultation with Stockholder Representative.

 

 _Schedule 6.11(a)_ sets forth, with respect to each current employee, of the
Company and the Operating Company, the maximum possible Continuing Employee
Actual Severance Amount and Continuing Employee Original Severance Amount.

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Companys Board of Directors and any committee administering the Change in
Control Policy will adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may
be required or appropriate to require the delivery of a customary release
reasonably satisfactory to Parent as a condition to receiving severance under
the Change in Control Policy and to confirm that payment of severance under
the Change in Control Policy is in lieu of payment of severance under

as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") for such Continuing
Employees service with the Company, the Operating Company and their
predecessor entities to the same extent recognized by the Company or Operating
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, taken as a whole and without
duplication. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent or the Operating
Company shall use their best efforts to arrange with insurers or benefits
providers to (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible
and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by,
and amounts reimbursed to, participants under similar plans maintained by the
Company and the Operating Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) or any other person shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement and nothing
herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan for any
purpose. Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Surviving Corporation or
any subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of
any employee (including any Offered Employee) at any time and for any reason
or no reason.

(e) The Company and the Operating Company will amend their 401(k) plans to
provide that the accounts of all participants who are employed by the Company
or the Operating Company or an ERISA Affiliate immediately prior to the
Closing shall be fully vested in their benefits under the plans,
notwithstanding any vesting schedule that would otherwise apply to such
participant. If requested by Parent prior to the Closing, each of the Company
and Operating Company shall adopt such resolutions by its Board of Directors
and take such other actions as may be required to terminate any and all
401(k) plans immediately prior to the Closing.

Section 6.12. _Directors and Officers Indemnification; Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
indemnification agreement, employment agreement or Benefit Plan, from the
Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, to the fullest extent provided by the Companys and the
Operating Companys organizational documents as in effect immediately prior
to Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each person who served
as an officer or director of the Company or the Operating Company or their
predecessors at any time prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, " _Costs_ "),
incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding to
which a Company Indemnified Party is a party or with respect to which a
Company Indemnified

 



-64-   Party is otherwise involved (including as a witness), arising out of or
pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was an
officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or the
Operating Company or their predecessors (including any Proceeding arising out
of or pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), whether such Proceeding is commenced, or any claim
or matter therein is asserted or claimed, prior to, at or after the Effective
Time. In the event of any such Proceeding (x) each Company Indemnified Party
will be entitled to advancement from the Surviving Corporation of fees, costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements)
incurred in connection with and prior to the final disposition of such
Proceedings, such fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and disbursements) to be advanced within ten (10) Business Days of
receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the Company Indemnified Party of a
request therefor; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such person is not entitled to indemnification, (y) the Surviving
Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any Proceeding in which indemnification could be sought by such
Company Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Company Indemnified Party
from all Liability arising out of such Proceeding, investigation or claim or
such Company Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (z) the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers than those set forth in the certificate of incorporation of the
Company in effect as of the Effective Time and the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation in effect immediately following the Effective Time, respectively,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 

(c) The Company shall purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year
prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope)
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by the Company and the Operating Company with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent agrees to, and agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by the Company or the Operating Company prior to the
date of this Agreement, each of which is set forth in _Schedule 6.12(c)_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Company Indemnified
Party is a party to or is otherwise involved (including as a witness) in any
Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
_Section 6.12_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
Proceeding.

 

(e) This _Section 6.12_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs and legal

 



-65-   representatives. The rights to indemnification and advancement and the other
rights provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights
to which a Company Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
contract or otherwise.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of
its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.12_.

Company Holders and the Stockholder Representative in connection with the
Scheduled Indemnity Matters and shall do all things reasonably necessary to
facilitate the conduct by the Company Holders and the Stockholder
Representative of any Proceeding related to the Scheduled Indemnity Matters
all at the sole expense of the Company Holders. Such cooperation and
facilitation shall include providing to the Company Holders and the
Stockholder Representative access to all information, documentation and
personnel related to the Scheduled Indemnity Matters reasonably requested by
the Company Holders or the Stockholder Representative.

Section 6.15. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall notify
Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the Company,
promptly of (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (c) any Proceeding commenced against the
Company or the Operating Company or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
that are related to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, (d) any event, change or effect between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which causes or is
reasonably likely to cause the failure of the any condition precedent to any
partys obligations hereunder. In no event shall (x) the delivery of any
notice by a party pursuant to this _Section 6.15_ limit or otherwise affect
the respective rights, obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement, or (y) disclosure by the Company or Parent be deemed to
amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule or constitute an exception
to any representation or warranty. This _Section 6.15_ shall not constitute

_Section 7.3(b)_.

such stockholders intent to exercise appraisal rights under the DGCL, any
exercise of appraisal rights by any stockholder and appraisal Proceedings in
connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in and
other costs in connection therewith), and any payments required to be made by
the Surviving Corporation or any other Parent Indemnified Party in connection
with any such exercise of appraisal rights (except to the extent that any
payment by such Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section
9.2(a)(vii)_ represents a portion of the Merger Consideration that was
required to be paid by Parent at the Effective Time and was withheld and not
paid by Parent as the result of the Shares held by any such Company Holder
being Dissenting Shares);

(viii) claims relating to the matters set forth in the Allocation Statement
or otherwise regarding the amount of Merger Consideration received by any
Company Holder (or the absence of any Merger Consideration received in respect

(b) _Limitations_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 9.2(a)_, the
Company Holders shall not be required to indemnify any Parent Indemnified
Party, and shall have no Liability:

(i) under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 9.2(a)(v)_ (other than the Tax
Representations), unless the aggregate of all Losses for which the Company
Holders would, but for this clause (i), be liable thereunder exceeds on a
cumulative basis an amount equal to $625,000 (the " _Basket_ "), and then
only to the extent of any such excess;

 



-74-  (ii) under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 9.2(a)(v)_ (other than the Tax
Representations), for any Loss resulting from any single claim or series of
related or similar claims which does not exceed $50,000 (the " _De Minimis
Limitation_ "); provided, that if the value of all Losses excluded from
indemnification pursuant to the De Minimis Limitation equals or exceeds
$450,000, then this _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ shall thereafter cease to apply in
respect of subsequent Losses; provided further, that all amounts
excluded from indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_ shall
nonetheless be included in determining whether the Basket has been met;

(iii) under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (other than the Tax Representations) in the
aggregate in excess of an amount equal to $12,500,000 (the " _Cap_ "); and

Merger Consideration.

 

(c) _Source of Recovery; Limitation of Liability_.

 

(i) The sole recourse of a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ (other than for claims of fraud, willful misrepresentation with
the intent to deceive or willful breach of a covenant) is limited to the
amount then on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and available for
distribution therefrom. In the event that the Indemnity Escrow Fund is
insufficient to pay any Parent Indemnified Party any amounts owed to such
Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ (other than for
claims of fraud, willful misrepresentation with the intent to deceive or
willful breach of a covenant), the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to collect any remaining amounts not satisfied from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund from the Company Holders or any other Person, and none of the
Company Holders, nor any other Person, shall have any Liability for any such
deficiency.

(ii) The initial recourse of a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(ii)_ through _(a)(ix)_ shall be to the amount then on deposit in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and available for distribution therefrom. In the event
that the Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient to pay a Parent Indemnified
Party any amounts owed to such Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(ii)_ through _(a)(ix)_ , each Company Holder shall severally, and not
jointly, up to such Company Holders Allocable Proceeds and subject to any
applicable limitations of _Article IX_ , indemnify and hold such Parent
Indemnified Party harmless from and against the portion of such Loss not
satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or through Parents exercise of
its set-off rights.

(iii) The initial recourse of a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to 
_Section 9.2(a)(x)_ shall be as follows: (A) first to any amount forfeited
from the

 



-75-   Stockholder Representative Expense Fund pursuant to _Section 9.4(d)(vii)_
and (B) then to the amount then on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and
available for distribution therefrom. In the event that the Indemnity Escrow
Fund is insufficient to pay a Parent Indemnified Party any amounts owed to
such Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(x)_, each Company
Holder shall severally, and not jointly, up to such Company Holders
Allocable Proceeds and subject to the applicable limitations of _Article IX_ ,
indemnify and hold such Parent Indemnified Party harmless from and against the
portion of such Loss not satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

(iv) No Company Holder shall have any Liability pursuant to this Agreement in
excess of such Company Holders Allocable Proceeds.

(d) _Limitations_. Nothing contained herein (including  _Section 9.1_,
_Section 9.2(c)_, and _Section 9.5(j)_) shall limit or restrict (i) any
Parent Indemnified Partys right to recover any amounts in connection with any
action or claim based upon fraud, willful misrepresentation with the intent
to deceive, or willful breach of a covenant or (ii) the ability of Parent to
exercise its set-off rights under, and limited by, _Section 9.8_.

 

Section 9.3. _Indemnification of the Stockholder Indemnified Parties_.

 

(a) _General_. If the Closing occurs, Parent hereby agrees to indemnify and
hold the stockholders of the Company and their respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, equity holders, agents, attorneys,
representatives, successors and assigns (the " _Stockholder Indemnified
Parties_ ") harmless from and against, and pay to the applicable Stockholder
Indemnified Parties the amount of, any and all Losses, to the extent:

(i) arising from or related to the breach of any of the representations or
warranties made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or in the closing
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_, other than the
Fundamental Parent Representations;

 

(ii) arising from or related to the breach of any covenant or other agreement
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement; and

(iii) arising from or related to any breach of a Fundamental Parent
Representation. 

(b) _Limitations_. Parent shall not be required to indemnify any Stockholder
Indemnified Party, and shall not have any Liability: (i) under _Section
9.3(a)(i)_ unless the aggregate of all Losses for which Parent would, but for
this clause (i), be liable thereunder exceeds on a cumulative basis the amount
of the Basket and, in such event, Parent shall only be required to pay such
Losses to the extent that such Losses exceed the Basket; (ii) under _Section
9.3(a)(i)_ for any Loss resulting from any single claim or series of related
or similar claims which does not exceed the De Minimis Limitation; _provided_
, that if the value of all Losses excluded from indemnification pursuant to

9.3(b)(ii) _shall cease to apply thereafter in respect of subsequent Losses;
provided further, that all amounts excluded from indemnification pursuant to
this _Section 9.3(b)(ii)_ shall

 



-76-   nonetheless be included in determining whether the Basket has been met; and
(iii) under _Section 9.3(a)(i)_ in the aggregate in excess of an amount equal
to the Cap;  _provided_ that the Cap limitation shall not apply to Losses
related to any failure by Parent to make any payment of Merger Consideration
that Parent is required to make or cause to be made hereunder. Nothing
contained herein shall limit or restrict any Stockholder Indemnified Partys
right to recover any amounts in connection with any action or claim based upon
fraud, willful misrepresentation with the intent to deceive or willful breach
of a covenant.

 

Section 9.4. _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) _Claims (Other Than Third Party Claims)_. A claim for indemnification for
any matter not involving a Third Party Claim may be asserted by prompt written
notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall not
preclude the indemnified party from any indemnification which it may claim in
accordance with this _Article IX_ except to the extent that the indemnifying
party can demonstrate actual prejudice to its defenses or counterclaims or
otherwise, or increased or aggravated Loss as a result of such failure. A
claim under this _Article IX_ for any matter not involving a Third Party
Claim may be made by notice to the Stockholder Representative.

(b) _Procedures for Third-Party Claims_. Except as set forth in _Section
9.4(d)_, in the event that any Proceedings shall be instituted or that any
claim or demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under _Section 9.2_ or  _Section 9.3_ hereof
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "):

(i) The indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the
assertion of any Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered
by this _Article IX_ to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of
the indemnified party to give prompt notice of any Third Party Claim shall
not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying partys obligations
with respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying party can
demonstrate actual prejudice to its defenses or counterclaims or otherwise,
or increased or aggravated Loss as a result of such failure.

(ii) Subject to the provisions of this  _Section 9.4_, the indemnifying
party shall have the right, at its sole expense, and at any time upon written
notice to the indemnified party to assume (with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party) the defense of, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder, and such assumption will conclusively establish
for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third Party
Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification under this
_Article IX_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not
be entitled (A) to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim if the Third
Party Claim is or relates directly to any criminal Proceeding or (B) be
entitled to maintain the defense of any Third Party Claim if the indemnifying
party has failed or is failing to defend vigorously the Third Party Claim.

 

(iii) If the indemnifying party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
9.4(b)_, the indemnified party shall not have any right to settle or
compromise such Third Party

 



-77-   Claim, and the indemnifying party shall obtain the prior written consent of
the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) before entering into any settlement of such Third
Party Claim if the settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release
the indemnified party from all Liability with respect to such Third Party
Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against
the indemnified party.

(iv) If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any
Losses indemnified against hereunder, or fails to notify the indemnified party
of its election as herein provided, the indemnified party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim; provided
that the indemnified party shall not enter into any settlement of such Third
Party Claim that would require payment to such third party without the prior
written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). If the indemnified party
defends any Third Party Claim for any reason permitted under this _Section
9.4(b)_, then the indemnifying party shall promptly reimburse the indemnified
party for the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) of defending such Third Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such reimbursement shall be made from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund to the extent there are sufficient funds then on deposit
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and available for distribution therefrom.

(v) If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense, in
the defense of such Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested
by the indemnifying party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict exists
between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such
separate representation advisable; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the
indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel
for all indemnified parties in connection with any Third Party Claim. If the
indemnified party is entitled to participate in such defense with separate
counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party as set forth in the preceding
sentence, then the indemnifying party shall promptly reimburse the indemnified
party for the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) of such participation in the defense of such Third Party
Claim upon submission of periodic bills; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such reimbursement shall be made from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the extent
there are sufficient funds then on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and
available for distribution therefrom.

(vi) The parties hereto agree to provide reasonable access to the other
parties hereto to such documents, information, personnel and witnesses as may
be reasonably requested in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such Third Party Claim. 

 



-78-  (c) _Payments_.

 

(i) Within twenty (20) calendar days of receipt of a claim notice (the "
_Objection Period_ ") pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_, the indemnifying party
may object (a " _Claim Objection_ ") to any matter, including the basis and
amount of such claims, set forth in such claim notice by delivering to the
indemnified party written notice setting forth such objection in reasonable
detail. If the indemnified party does not receive a Claim Objection within the
Objection Period, then the indemnifying party shall be deemed to have
acknowledged and agreed with the correctness of such claim notice for the
full amount set forth therein and shall thereafter be precluded from disputing
such amount. If the indemnifying party delivers a timely Claim Objection to
the indemnified party, the indemnified party shall not be entitled to payment
of such amount until a Final Determination has been made with respect to such
claim pursuant to _Section 9.4(c)(ii)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that this
_Section 9.4(c)(i)_ shall not limit Parents rights under (and subject to)
_Section 9.8_ to set off amounts prior to the Final Determination of such
claim.

(ii) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time
in which to appeal therefrom (or final resolution of any such appeal), or a
settlement shall have been consummated, or the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each
case whether with respect to a Third Party Claim hereunder or a dispute or
claim hereunder that is not a Third Party Claim (any such occurrence, a "
_Final Determination_ ") , the indemnified party shall forward to the
indemnifying party written notice of all Losses owing by the
indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter.
The indemnifying party shall pay all amounts due and owing to the indemnified
party pursuant hereto by wire transfer of immediately available funds within
five Business Days after the date of such notice (or final resolution of the
amount then due and owing in the event of any dispute); provided that if the
indemnifying party is a Company Holder, the amount owing hereunder shall, if
required, be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with and
subject to the limitations of _Section 9.2_.

(d) _Procedure for Scheduled Indemnity Matters_. Without limiting the Parent
Indemnified Parties rights to indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)(x)_, all
proceedings that constitute a Scheduled Indemnity Matter, whether currently
ongoing (as disclosed on _Schedule 6.14_ ) or brought hereafter and arising
from, or substantially related to, the facts, circumstances or allegations set
forth on _Schedule 6.14_ (each, a " _Special Indemnity Claim_ ") shall be
conducted exclusively in the manner set forth in this _Section 9.4(d)_, as
follows:

(i) The Stockholder Representative shall, at its sole expense, continue to
control the defense of any proceedings constituting a Scheduled Indemnity
Matter and shall also be entitled to control the defense of, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any such Scheduled Indemnity Matter or any other
Special Indemnity Claim.

(ii) All Losses arising in connection with any Scheduled Indemnity Matter
or Special Indemnity Claim, including without limitation costs of
investigation

 



-79-   and defense, legal and accounting fees and expenses, expert fees and
expenses, court fees, settlements, judgments, awards, indemnification payments
and out-of-pocket expenses of the Stockholder Representative, shall be paid
or reimbursed from the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund. The
Stockholder Representative shall provide Parent with reasonable documentation
evidencing the purpose of each withdrawal or disbursement from
the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund that is in excess of $50,000.
Parent, however, shall not be entitled to challenge, question, delay or
prevent the payment of the requested expenses and reimbursements.

 

(iii) Parent shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any
Special Indemnity Claim of which it has knowledge and which is covered by
this _Article IX_ to be forwarded to the Stockholder Representative (in any
event within thirty (30) days after becoming aware thereof). The failure of
Parent to give reasonably prompt notice of any Special Indemnity Claim shall
not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnification obligations of the
Company Holders with respect thereto, except to the extent that the Company
Holders can demonstrate actual prejudice to their defenses or counterclaims
or otherwise, or increased or aggravated Loss as a result of such failure.

(iv) Subject to the provisions of this _Section 9.4_, the Stockholder
Representative shall have the exclusive right and obligation, at its sole
expense, to assume the defense of, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with
any Special Indemnity Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder.

(v) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any right to
participate in the defense of a Special Indemnity Claim without the consent of
the Stockholder Representative, nor shall either have the right to settle or
compromise such Special Indemnity Claim.

 

(vi) The Stockholder Representative shall keep Parent reasonably apprised of
developments regarding the Special Indemnity Claim.

(vii) The parties contemplate that all Losses arising out of Special Indemnity
Claims shall be satisfied by the Stockholder Representative out of the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund. In the event that the Stockholder
Representative fails or is unable to satisfy any of such Losses ("
_Unsatisfied Losses_ ") within thirty (30) days after any final decision,
judgment or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal
therefrom (or final resolution of any such appeal), or a settlement shall
have been consummated, an amount equal to such Unsatisfied Losses in the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund shall be irrevocably forfeited by the
Company Holders and the Stockholder Representative and shall become the
property of Parent and Parent shall be entitled to indemnification (without
duplication) pursuant to the indemnification procedures set forth in this
_Article IX_.

Section 9.5. _Tax Indemnity_. The provisions of this _Section 9.5_ shall
govern the allocation of responsibility between the Company Holders and Parent
for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date.

 



-80-  (a) _Tax Indemnification_. If the Closing occurs, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Operating Company (the " _Tax Indemnified Parties_ ")
shall be entitled to be indemnified, initially from the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
against any and all Losses (" _Indemnified Tax Losses_ ") attributable to,
arising from or related to (i) all Taxes (or the nonpayment thereof) of the
Company and the Operating Company for all Tax periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date of any Tax
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (each such Tax
period or portion thereof hereinafter is referred to as a " _Pre-Closing Tax
Period_ "), and (ii) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, the Tax Representations;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the case of clause (i) above, the Tax
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification only to the extent
that the Indemnified Tax Losses exceed the amount, if any, reserved for such
Taxes on the face of the Conclusive Statement and taken into account in
determining Adjusted Net Working Capital. In the event that the Indemnity
Escrow Fund is insufficient to pay a Parent Indemnified Party any amounts owed
to such Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this  _Section 9.5(a)_, each
Company Holder shall, severally and not jointly, up to such Company Holders
Allocable Proceeds and subject to any applicable limitations of this _Article
IX_ , indemnify and hold such Parent Indemnified Party harmless from and
against the portion of such Loss not satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
or through Parents exercise of its set-off rights.

(b) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Tax period that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date (such Tax period hereinafter is referred to as a
" _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by
income or receipts of the Company and the Operating Company for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the Closing Date and the amount of other Taxes of the Company and
the Operating Company for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
from the beginning of the Straddle Period through and including the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period.

(c) _Preparation of Tax Returns_. The Stockholder Representative shall prepare
or cause to be prepared and filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns for the
Company and the Operating Company for (x) any completed Pre-Closing Tax
Period for which Tax Returns have not been filed as of the Closing Date and
(y) for any Straddle Period for which Tax Returns are required to be prepared
and filed (all such Tax Returns referred to in clause (y) of this _Section
9.5(c)_ being referred to herein as the " _Straddle Period Returns_ "). The
Stockholder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared, consistent
with applicable Law, all amended Tax Returns of the Company and the Operating
Company for all Tax Periods ending prior to the Closing Date. The Stockholder
Representative shall provide to Parent for its review a draft of each Straddle
Period Return and any new or amended Tax Return for any Tax Period ending
before the Closing Date no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
for filing such Tax Return with the appropriate Tax Authorities and shall make
such revisions as are reasonably requested by Parent. Parent will, and will
cause the Surviving Corporation and the Operating Company to, join in the
execution and filing of any Tax Returns prepared by the Stockholder
Representative. The Stockholder Representative shall pay all Taxes due with
respect to Tax Returns of the Company and the Operating Company relating to
Tax

 



-81-   Periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall pay any such Taxes to the extent of the amount, if any,
reserved for such Taxes on the face of the Conclusive Statement and taken
into account in determining Adjusted Net Working Capital. Parent shall pay all
Taxes due with respect to Straddle Period Returns; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company Holders shall indemnify Parent for any amount owed by the
Company Holders pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_.

(d) _Parent Tax Actions_. Except as may (or may reasonably be determined in
good faith by Parent to) be required by applicable Tax Law, without the
Stockholder Representatives prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, Parent shall not, and shall
not permit the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Operating Company to,
do any of the following: (i) file any amended Tax Return relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (ii) agree to extend any statute of limitations with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) make any election or (iv) take
any other similar administrative action (including the filing of any
administrative adjustment request for any Pre-Closing Tax Period) that, in
each case, could affect the Company Holders Tax liabilities for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (including any indemnification obligation under _Section
9.5(a)_ or any rights of the Company Holders to receive Pre-Closing Tax
Refunds as provided in  _Section 9.5(e)_).

(e) _Tax Refunds_. The amount of any refunds received by the Company or the
Operating Company with respect to any taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date (any such amount, a " _Pre-Closing Tax Refund_ ") shall be
for the account of the Company Holders. The amount of any refunds of Taxes of
the Surviving Corporation or the Operating Company with respect to any
Taxable period beginning after the Closing Date shall be for the account of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Operating Company, as applicable. The
amount of any refunds of Taxes of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Operating Company for any Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the
Company Holders, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in the manner
described in _Section 9.5(b)_ (in each case to the extent of the applicable
partys interest in such refunds). The Stockholder Representative shall at its
own cost and expense, control all Tax Proceedings solely involving refunds for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this
_Section 9.5(e)_, Tax refunds shall not include debit balances in current Tax
accounts to the extent they are reflected in the calculation of Adjusted Net
Working Capital.

 

(f) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. After the Closing Date, the parties hereto
shall:

 

(i) cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to _Section
9.5(c)_ and any audits of, or disputes with Governmental Entities regarding,
any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Operating Company and take any actions reasonably requested by the
other party in connection therewith;

(ii) make available to one another and to any Governmental Entity, as
reasonably requested in connection with any Tax Return described in this
section or any audit, litigation, or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes,
all reasonably relevant information relating

 



-82-   to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Operating Company, and make employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder;

(iii) furnish one another with copies of all correspondence received from any
Governmental Entity in connection with any Tax audit or information request
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period;

 

(iv) use their respective best efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including,
without limitation, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby);

(v) upon request, provide to the other party all information that the other
party may be required to report pursuant to Sections 6043 or 6043A of the
Code, or Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder; and

(vi) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Operating Company relating to any
Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or the
Stockholder Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Entity, and to give the other Person reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other Person so requests, Parent or the Stockholder
Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the other Person to take
possession of such books and records.

(g) _Certain Taxes and Fees __._ All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges, and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid by Parent,
it being understood and acknowledged that one-half of such Transfer Taxes (to
the extent known in amount prior to the Effective Time and as agreed between
the parties) are being paid through a deduction from the Initial Merger
Consideration. Parent, the Company and the Stockholder Representative will
reasonably cooperate, and will cause their respective Affiliates, officers,
employees, agents, auditors and other Representatives reasonably to cooperate,
in preparing and filing all required returns in connection with such Transfer
Taxes.

(h) _Survival_. The Tax Indemnified Parties right to commence any claim for
indemnification for Taxes under _Section 9.5(a)_ shall survive Closing and
continue until the relevant Governmental Entities are no longer entitled to
assess or reassess any of the Company or the Operating Company in respect of
the Taxes in question. 

(i) _Tax Proceedings_. If any Tax Proceeding is initiated by any Governmental
Entity that could result in a claim for Indemnified Tax Losses under _Section
9.5(a)_, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event later than
the earlier of (i) ten (10) calendar

 



-83-   days after receipt of notice from the Governmental Entity of such claim or
(ii) fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the date required for the filing of
any response to or protest of such claim, notify the Stockholder
Representative in writing of such fact. Failure to timely provide such notice
shall not affect the right of the Tax Indemnified Partys indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent the Stockholder Representative and the
Company Holders are prejudiced by such delay or omission. The Stockholder
Representative shall, at its own cost and expense, control all decisions with
respect to any Tax Proceeding solely involving Indemnified Tax Losses and the
Tax Indemnified Party shall take such action (including settlement with
respect to such Tax Proceeding or the prosecution of such Tax Proceeding to a
determination in a court or other tribunal of initial or appellate
jurisdiction) in connection with a Tax Proceeding solely involving an
Indemnified Tax Claim as the Stockholder Representative shall reasonably
request in writing from time to time, including the selection of counsel and
experts. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this  _Section 9.5(i)_,
the Stockholder Representative shall not settle or compromise any Tax
Proceedings without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement
or compromise will adversely affect Parent or any of its Affiliates in any
Post-Closing Tax Period.

(j) _Source of Recovery_. The initial recourse of a Tax Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Section 9.5_ shall be to the Stockholder Representative
Expense Fund pursuant to _Section 9.8(c)_, then to the amount then on deposit
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and available for distribution therefrom. In the
event that the Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient to pay a Tax Indemnified
Party any amounts owed to such Tax Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section
9.5_, each Company Holder shall, severally and not jointly, up to such
Company Holders Allocable Proceeds and subject to the applicable limitations
of this _Article IX_ , indemnify and hold such Parent Indemnified Party
harmless from and against the portion of such Loss not satisfied from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund. Parent also will be entitled to exercise its set-off
rights specified in _Section 9.8_.

Section 9.6. _Other_.

(a) _Knowledge_. The right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy
based on the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations set forth
herein will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or
any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) about, the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation.

 

(b) _Disregard Materiality_. For purposes of determining the failure of any
representations or warranties to be true and correct, and calculating Losses
hereunder, any materiality or material adverse effect qualifications in the
representations and warranties shall be disregarded (but not, for
clarification, any dollar thresholds and not for purposes of any of
the representations to the extent requiring a listing of material matters).

(c) _Adjustments_. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is
provided under this _Article IX_ shall be net of (i) any amounts actually
recovered by the indemnified party pursuant to any indemnification by or
indemnification agreement with any third party and (ii) any insurance
proceeds actually received as an offset against such Loss, in each case, after
deducting any related costs and expenses, including the aggregate cost of

 



-84-   pursuing any related insurance claims and any related increases in insurance
premiums or other chargebacks. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any
payment required under this _Article IX_ is determined after payment by the
indemnifying party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an
indemnified party pursuant to this _Article IX_ , the indemnified party shall
repay to the indemnifying party, promptly after such determination, any
amount that the indemnifying party would not have had to pay pursuant to this
_Article IX_ had such determination been made at the time of such payment. The
indemnifying party may require, as a condition to the provision
of indemnification hereunder, that the indemnified party execute an
undertaking consistent with its obligations set forth in this _Section
9.6(c)_. The indemnification provided for in this _Article IX_ is not intended
and shall not be deemed to limit, condition, reduce or supplant the primary
availability of any insurance that would be available in the absence of such
indemnification.

(d) _Tax Treatment_. Any payments under this _Article IX_ (including the
payment to the Company Holders of any Pre-Closing Tax Benefits) shall be
treated for Tax purposes (whether foreign or domestic) as a purchase price
adjustment, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(e) _Insurance_. Each indemnified party shall consider in good faith the
potential availability of insurance coverage under then-current policies (but
without any obligation to seek to recover any such insurance proceeds) in
connection with making a claim under this _Article IX_. No indemnifying party
shall be entitled to be subrogated to any rights of an indemnified party,
except that if and to the extent an indemnifying party indemnifies an
indemnified party for Losses pursuant to this _Article IX_ ,
such indemnifying party shall be subrogated to any rights such indemnified
party may have against any insurer with respect thereto (and, upon the
reasonable request of the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall take
appropriate actions necessary to transfer and assign any such rights to the
indemnifying party). The indemnification provided for this _Article IX_ is not
intended and shall not be deemed to limit, condition, reduce or supplant the
primary availability of any insurance that would be available in the absence
of such indemnification.

(f) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to  _Section 10.10_, each party
acknowledges and agrees that the remedies provided for in this _Article IX_
shall be the sole and exclusive right and remedy exercisable by such party
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement (other than claims for
injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable relief); _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing herein shall (i) limit any partys remedies with
respect to claims arising from or related to fraud or willful
misrepresentation with the intent to deceive or willful breach of a covenant
or (ii) prevent or restrict any Person who is a party to any other Transaction
Document from obtaining monetary damages or any other legal or equitable
relief in connection with the breach of such agreement.

(g) _Disclaimers_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY ELSEWHERE IN THIS
AGREEMENT OR PROVIDED FOR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE LAW, NO PARTY NOR ANY
STOCKHOLDER OF THE COMPANY OR STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE, NOR ANY CURRENT OR
FORMER STOCKHOLDER, DIRECTOR, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE, AFFILIATE OR ADVISOR OF ANY
OF THE FOREGOING SHALL, IN ANY EVENT, BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PERSON, EITHER
IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY SPECIAL,

 



-85-   INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OTHER THAN
FORESEEABLE CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, RELATING TO THE BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH OF
ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER OR NOT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES HAS BEEN DISCLOSED TO THE OTHER PARTY IN ADVANCE, EXCEPT IN EACH CASE
TO THE EXTENT INCLUDED IN A THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR ARISING FROM A CLAIM BASED
UPON FRAUD, WILLFUL MISREPRESENTATION WITH THE INTENT TO DECEIVE OR A WILLFUL
BREACH OF A COVENANT IN THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 9.7. _Escrow_. Subject to the Escrow Agreement, promptly following
the eighteen-month anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall
release the Indemnity Escrow Fund as directed by the Stockholder
Representative (who may direct that the Indemnity Escrow Fund be distributed
to the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund), except that the Escrow Agent
shall retain an amount (up to the total amount then held by the Escrow Agent)
equal to the amount of claims for indemnification under _Section 9.2_ (other
than  _Section 9.2(a)(x)_) and _Section 9.5(a)_ asserted prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period but not yet resolved. The
Indemnity Escrow Funds retained for unresolved claims shall be released by the
Escrow Agent (to the extent not utilized to pay Parent for any such claims
resolved in favor of Parent) upon their resolution in accordance with this
_Article IX_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

Section 9.8. _Right of Set-off_. In addition to and without limiting any other
right of any Parent Indemnified Party set forth in this Agreement, and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:

(a) _Exhaustion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund_. After such time as there is no
amount on deposit and available for distribution under the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, Parent may set off against amounts that would otherwise be payable by
Parent hereunder, including the Contingent Payments, (i) any amount for which
Parent (or any Parent Indemnified Party) would otherwise be entitled under
this _Article IX_ to seek reimbursement directly from the Company Holders or
(ii) any amount for which any Parent Indemnified Party would have been able
to obtain indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ had the Indemnity Escrow
Fund not been reduced by claims arising other than pursuant to such Section
(including claims under _Section 2.10(d)_,  _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ through
(x), and _Section 9.5_). As a condition to exercising such set-off rights,
Parent must first provide the Stockholder Representative with written notice
describing the basis of seeking such set-off right, including a good faith
estimate of the amount sought to be set-off (the " _Set-Off Amount_ ").
Thereafter, Parent must promptly (i) deposit the Set-Off Amount into the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and (ii) disburse to the Stockholder Representative for
further distribution to the Company Holders in accordance with this Agreement
any remaining amounts then required to be disbursed by Parent hereunder. All
determinations regarding Parents entitlement to any Set-Off Amount shall be
made in accordance with the provisions of this _Article IX_ in the same manner
as Parents entitlement to amounts on deposit and available for distribution
under the Indemnity Escrow Fund. In the event that the Indemnity Escrow Fund
has been disbursed in full, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall
establish a substitute escrow fund with the same Escrow Agent, utilizing

 



-86-   substantially the same Escrow Agreement and following the same procedures
for adjudicating issues arising in connection with such escrow fund as the
procedures set forth under this  _Article IX_.

(b) _Scheduled Indemnity Matters: Fraud_. Parent may set off against amounts
that would otherwise be payable by Parent hereunder, including the Contingent
Payments, (i) any amounts to which Parent (or any Parent Indemnified Party) is
entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)(x)_ or (ii) any amount
in connection with any action or claim based upon fraud, willful
misrepresentation with the intent to deceive or willful breach of a covenant
of this Agreement, in each case without regard to the amount then on deposit
in and available for distribution from the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

(c) _Payment of Tax Refunds_. Upon receipt by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation of any Pre-Closing Tax Refund or the Pre-Closing portion of any
refund for a Straddle Period, (collectively, the " _Tax Refunds_ "), Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall promptly, but in no event more than ten (10)
Business Days, remit all of such amounts to the Stockholder Representative
for deposit into the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund. The amounts
remitted pursuant to the preceding sentence to the Stockholder Representative
Expense Fund shall be available, together with all amounts in such fund, for
administering any Tax audits, reviews or similar Proceedings (each, an "
_Audit_ ") and settling any Tax liabilities or related Losses arising
therefrom. In the event that within nine (9) months after receipt of any Tax
Refund (the " _Notice Period_ "), no notice of any Audit has been issued by
the Internal Revenue Service to the Stockholder Representative, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation which could give rise to any indemnification rights of
the Parent Indemnified Parties under this Agreement (the " _Audit Notice_ ")
and no Audit noticed or commenced prior to the receipt of such Tax Refund
remains pending, then the Stockholder Representative shall be permitted to
distribute the full amount of such Tax Refund to the Company Holders;
provided, however, that no such distribution shall limit any indemnification
rights of the Parent Indemnified Parties under this Agreement. In the event
that an Audit of the Company or the Surviving Corporation related to any Pre-
Closing Period or the Straddle Period occurs or is continuing within the
Notice Period, then upon the later of (i) full and final conclusion of all
such Audits, and (ii) the end of the Notice Period, the Stockholder
Representative shall be permitted to distribute the entire balance of any Tax
Refund remaining in the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund to the Company
Holders; provided, however, that if the Internal Revenue Service narrows the
scope of any such Audit to apply only to particular matters, then Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall in good faith determine a portion of the
Tax Refunds, if any, that the Stockholder Representative shall be permitted
to distribute to the Company Holders.

(d) _Set-Off Procedures_. Parent shall exercise its rights to set-off under
this _Section 9.8_ upon notice to the Stockholder Representative specifying
in reasonable detail the basis therefor, as specified in _Section 9.8(a)_
above. The exercise of such right of set-off by Parent in good faith, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 9.8(a)_, whether or not
ultimately determined to be justified, will not constitute an event of default
hereunder. Parent may exercise its rights to set-off under this _Section
9.8_ in respect of known claims for which the amount of Losses are not yet
liquidated subject to the procedures set forth in this _Section 9.8_. Neither
the exercise of nor the failure to exercise any such right of set-off will
constitute an election of remedies or limit Parent in any manner in the
enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.

 



-87-  ARTICLE X

_General Provisions_

Section 10.1. _No Additional Representations_ _._ Parent acknowledges that
(i) none of the Company, the Operating Company or any other Person has made

Section 10.3. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the

thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise
without the prior written consent of each of the other parties; _provided_ ,
that Parent may assign its rights and obligations (a) to an Affiliate, (b) as
collateral security to any Person providing financing to Parent or any of its

enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



-88-  Section 10.4. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries; No Recourse to Lenders_. Except

the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing
herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person,

legal or equitable rights hereunder. The Lender, its Affiliates, and/or any
other Persons that have committed to provide or otherwise entered into
agreements in connection with the Debt Financing or other financings in

_Debt Financing Source_ ") are intended third-party beneficiaries of _Section
10.4_,  _Section 10.9(b)_, _Section 10.9(c)_, and _Section 10.15_. Except

capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the proposed financing
described in the Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing_ ")), and (b)
the Lender and its Affiliates and any Debt Financing Sources (solely in their
respective capacities as lenders or arrangers) shall not have any rights or

case of both clauses (a) and (b)) at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise.

in connection with or relating to this Agreement or any matters or
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, heard and determined
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (provided that,

of or relating to this

 



-91-   Agreement or any matters or transactions contemplated by this Agreement in

described in _clause (a)_ of this _Section 10.9_, as well as to the
jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken from such court,

governing service of process, (d) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from

objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such
Proceeding in any such court or that any such Proceeding was brought in an
inconvenient forum, (f) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, as a
method of service to service of process in such Proceeding by mailing of
copies thereof to such party at its address set forth in _Section 10.5_, (g)

provided herein shall be effective and binding service in every respect and
(h) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the rights of any party to effect

the parties further agrees to waive any bond, surety or other security that
might be required of any other party with respect to any Proceeding, including
an appeal thereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Proceeding (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Lender or any
Debt Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). The
provisions of this _Section 10.9(b)_ shall be enforceable by the Lender, each
Debt Financing Source, their respective Affiliates and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR
CAUSE OF ACTION (i) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (ii) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE COMMITMENT LETTER

ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND
THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY
OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

Section 10.10. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance

 



-92-   with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy they may have at
law or in equity.

construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State,

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. This Agreement may be
executed and delivered by facsimile or electronic transmission.

 

Section 10.13. _Obligation of Parent_. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger
Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action and
a guarantee of the payment and performance thereof by Parent.

Section 10.14. _Obligation of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement requires
the Company to take any action, or to refrain from taking any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause the Operating Company to take such action, or to refrain from
taking any action, and a guarantee of the payment and performance thereof by
the Company. The Operating Company agrees to cooperate with the Company in
taking such actions required by this Agreement, and to refrain from taking any
action that is prohibited by this Agreement.

Section 10.15. _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may only be
amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each
party hereto; provided, however, that  _Section 10.4_, _Section 10.9(b)_,
_Section 10.9(c)_, or _Section 10.15_ of this Agreement may not be amended
in any manner that materially and adversely affects the rights of the Lender
or any of its Affiliates or any Debt Financing Source unless the Lender
consents to such amendment.

Section 10.16. _Stockholder Representative_.

(a) _Authority_. By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to Delaware Law
(or otherwise), the Company Holders hereby irrevocably appoint Shareholder
Representative Services LLC as the representative, agent, proxy, and attorney
in fact of and for all Company Holders for all purposes under this Agreement
(the " _Stockholder Representative_ "), including without limitation the full
power and authority on the Company Holders behalf to take the actions set
forth herein and in the Stockholder Representative Agreement (all of which
actions shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable outside of this Agreement
and shall be binding on the Company Holders as a matter of contract law),
including, without limitation:

(i) to take any and all actions involving or relating to any and all Scheduled
Indemnity Matters and other Special Indemnity Claims,

 



-93-  (ii) to consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the

the other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or
executed in connection herewith,

behalf of the Company Holders under this Agreement or otherwise (it being

Company Holder, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have no
further liability with respect thereto),

pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to satisfy any and all Liabilities

of the Company Holders in connection with this Agreement and the other
agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in

Agreement, further agree that such agency and proxy are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Stockholder
Representative, and shall survive the death, incapacity, 

 



-94-   bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Company Holder. All decisions
and actions by the Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon all
Company Holders, and no Company Holder shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Parent may conclusively rely,
without independent verification or investigation, upon any such decision or
action of the Stockholder Representative as being the binding decision or
action of every Company Holder, and Parent shall not be liable to any Company
Holder or any other Persons for any actions taken or omitted from being taken
by them or by Parent in accordance with or reliance upon any such decision
or action of the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative
shall have no duties or obligations to the Company Holders hereunder,
including any fiduciary duties, except those set forth herein, and such duties
and obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
Agreement. The power of attorney granted by each Company Holder to the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to this _Section 10.16_ is coupled with
an interest and is irrevocable and shall not terminate or otherwise be
affected by the death, disability, incompetence, bankruptcy or insolvency of
any Company Holder.

 

(c) _Reliance_. Any party may rely upon any decision, consent or instruction
of the Stockholder Representative on behalf of itself or, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company in connection with this Agreement and is relieved
from any liability to any person for any act performed in accordance with such
decision, consent or instruction. Any party may rely, without inquiry,
upon any written notice from the Stockholder Representative or any successor
Stockholder Representative, and may deal with the successors with respect to
any matter arising under this Agreement.

 

(d) _Indemnity_. By the approval of this Agreement pursuant to Delaware Law
(or otherwise), each Company Holder hereby severally, for itself only and not
jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative
and each member of the Stockholder Representative Advisory Committee (the "
_Committee_ ") and their respective partners, managers, officers, agents and
other representatives against all expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines and amounts incurred by such Persons in connection
with any Proceeding to which the Stockholder Representative or such other
Person is made a party by reason of the fact that it is or was acting as the
Stockholder Representative or member of the Committee pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 

(e) _No Liability_. Neither the Stockholder Representative, nor any member of
the Committee, nor any of their respective members, managers, officers,
agents or other representatives shall incur any Liability to any Company
Holder by virtue of the failure or refusal of such Persons for any reason to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the
performance of their duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions
constituting fraud, willful misrepresentation with the intent to deceive or a
willful breach of any covenant of this Agreement or the Stockholder
Representative Agreement. The Stockholder Representative and members of the
Committee and their respective members, managers, officers, agents and other
representatives shall have no Liability in respect of any Proceeding brought
against such Persons by any Company Holder, regardless of the legal theory
under which such Liability may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in
contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, if such
Persons took or omitted taking any action in good faith.

 



-95-  (f) _Expense Fund_. By approval of this Agreement pursuant to Delaware law
(or otherwise), the Company Holders agree to the establishment of the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund, and further agree that the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
withdraw from the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund any and all amounts
necessary or desirable for purposes of discharging its duties and the duties
of the Committee under any provision of this Agreement and paying or
reimbursing its costs and expenses in discharging those duties (the "
_Charges_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that until the Final Determination of
all Scheduled Indemnity Matters and Special Indemnity Claims, the Stockholder
Representative may not make any distributions to the Company Holders without
the consent of Parent (which will not be unreasonably withheld). Such Charges
include, without limitation, any and all legal, accounting, consulting, expert
and other professional fees and expenses incurred in filing tax returns,
obtaining and distributing Tax Refunds, investigating and resolving, whether
by litigation, arbitration, mediation, settlement or otherwise, any and all
claims, including without limitation Scheduled Indemnity Matters and other
Special Indemnity Claims, Third Party Claims and claims by Parent and its
Affiliates under this Agreement, any Charges relating to the review of the
Post-closing Statement and the Adjustment Statement, the determination of
Contingent Payments and the collection and distribution of any and all funds
to the Company Holders pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. In the
event such amounts are insufficient to satisfy the Charges, then each Company
Holder will be obligated to pay of such deficit on a several, and not joint,
basis. After the completion of all responsibility of the Stockholder
Representative, all remaining amounts in the Stockholder Representative
Expense Fund shall (subject to _Section 9.4(d)(vii)_) be disbursed to the
Agent for distribution to the Company Holders as additional Merger
Consideration.

(g) _Removal_. Following the Closing Date, a majority-in-interest of the
Company Holders may, by written consent, remove the Stockholder Representative
or any member of the Committee and appoint a new representative as his or her
replacement. Notice together with a copy of the written consent appointing
such new representative and bearing the signatures of Company Holders of a
majority-in-interest of those Company Holders must be delivered to Parent not
less than ten (10) calendar days prior to such appointment. Such appointment
will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the
date such consent is received by Parent.

(h) _Stockholder Representative Advisory Committee_. The Company Holders
hereby appoint F. Michael Zachara, Zev Scherl and Steven St. Peter as members
of the Committee. The responsibility of the Committee shall be to provide
advice to the Stockholder Representative, but shall not be responsible for any
decision made by the Stockholder Representative based upon such advice. In the
event that a member of the Stockholder Representative Advisory Committee or
the Stockholder Representative becomes unable or unwilling to continue in its
capacity as Stockholder Representative, or if a member of the Stockholder
Representative Advisory Committee or the Stockholder Representative resigns,
a majority-in-interest of the Company Holders may by written consent appoint a
new representative as his or her replacement, who shall have all of the
rights, powers and duties hereunder. Notice and a copy of the written consent
appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures of a majority-
in-interest of the Company Holders must be delivered to Parent. Such
appointment will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the
consent or the date such consent is received by Parent, as the case may be.

 



-96-  (i) _Stockholder Representative Agreement_. By the approval of this Agreement,
the Company Holders hereby agree to, and hereby join as parties to, the
Stockholder Representative Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ , the
provisions of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference as
if fully set forth herein. Where this Agreement and the Stockholder
Representative Agreement are inconsistent, the terms of the Stockholder
Representative Agreement shall govern.

Section 10.17. _Conflicts and Privilege_. Parent, on behalf of itself, the
Surviving Company and the Operating Company and its respective Affiliates
(together, a " _Parent Party_ "), agrees that, notwithstanding any current or
prior representation of the Company by Foley and Lardner LLP (" _Foley_ "),
Foley shall be allowed to represent the Stockholder Representative and its
Affiliates in any matters and disputes adverse to the Parent Party that
either is existing on the date hereof or arises in the future and relates to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent, on behalf of
itself and each Parent Party, hereby (a) waives any claim that any Parent
Party has or may have that Foley has a conflict of interest or is otherwise
prohibited from engaging in such representation and (b) agrees that, if a
dispute arises after the Closing between a Parent Party and the Stockholder
Representative or any of its Affiliates, then Foley may represent the
Stockholder Representative or any of its Affiliates in such dispute, even
though the interests of the Stockholder Representative or any of its
Affiliates may be directly adverse to the Parent Party and even though Foley
may have represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Parent Party. Parent, on
behalf of itself and each Parent Party, also agrees that, as to all
communications between or among Foley and a Company Holder, the Stockholder
Representative, the Company, and/or any of its respective Affiliates that
relate in any way to the transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-
client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the
Company Holders and the Stockholder Representative, may not be controlled by
any Parent Party and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Parent Party
or the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises between a
Parent Party and a third party other than the Stockholder Representative or an
Affiliate of the Stockholder Representative after the Closing, then the Parent
Party (to the extent applicable) may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure to such third party of confidential communications by
Foley; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Party may not waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Stockholder
Representative.

BYLAWS 





 

 _ARTICLE I_

_OFFICES_

1\. _Principal Office_. The principal office of the Corporation shall be
located at such place as may be determined from time to time by the Board of
Directors.

2\. _Registered Office_. The registered office of the Corporation required by
law to be maintained in the State of Delaware may be, but need not be,
identical with the principal office.

3\. _Other Offices_. The Corporation may have offices at such other places,
either within or without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors may
from time to time determine or as the affairs of the Corporation may require.

_ARTICLE II_

 

 _MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS_

1\. _Place of Meetings_. All meetings of stockholders shall be held at the
principal office of the Corporation or at such other place, either within or
without the State of Delaware, as shall be designated in the notice of the
meeting or agreed upon by the Board of Directors, the President or the Chief
Executive Officer. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion,
determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be
held solely by means of remote communication as provided by law.

2\. _Annual Meeting_. Unless directors are elected by written consent in lieu
of an annual meeting, the annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held on
a date during the month of April and at a time (except a Saturday, Sunday or a
legal holiday) determined by the Board of Directors, for the purpose of
electing Directors of the Corporation and for the transaction of such other
business as may be properly brought before the meeting.

3\. _Substitute Annual Meeting_. If the annual meeting shall not be held in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of this Article II a substitute
annual meeting may be called in accordance with the provisions of Section 4
of this Article II. A meeting so called shall be designated and treated for
all purposes as the annual meeting. The shares represented at such substitute
annual meeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote thereat,
shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of such meeting.

 



1 4\. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders may be called at
any time by the Board of Directors, chairperson of the Board of Directors,
the Chief Executive Officer or President of the Corporation or one or more
stockholders holding not less than 10% of the shares entitled to be cast at
such a meeting, but such special meetings may not be called by any other
person or persons.

5\. _Notice of Meetings_.

 

(a) Written or printed notice stating the time and place, if any, of the
meeting and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders
and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
meeting shall be delivered not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60)
days before the date thereof, by or at the direction of the Board
of Directors, President, Secretary or other person calling the meeting, to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. Without limiting
the manner by which notice otherwise may be given to stockholders, any notice
shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to
(in a manner consistent with the Delaware General Corporation Law) by the
stockholder to whom the notice is given. If notice is given by electronic
transmission, such notice shall be deemed given at the time specified in
Section 232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. If mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail
addressed to the stockholder at such stockholders address as it appears on
the record of stockholders of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.

(b) In the case of an annual or substitute annual meeting, the notice of
meeting need not specifically state the business to be transacted thereat
unless it is a matter, other than election of Directors, on which the vote of
the stockholders is expressly required by the provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law. In the case of a special meeting, the notice of
meeting shall specifically state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting
is called.

 

(c) When a meeting is adjourned for thirty (30) days or more, or when a new
record date is fixed after the adjournment for the adjourned meeting, notice
of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting.
When a meeting is adjourned for less than thirty (30) days in any one
adjournment and a new record date is not fixed, it is not necessary to give
any notice of the time and place (if any, or the means of remote
communication, if any) of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be
transacted thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. 

6\. _Voting Lists_. The Secretary shall prepare, at least ten (10) days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled
to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the
address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of
each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least
ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic
network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list
is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business
hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the meeting
is held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time
and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected
by any stockholder who is present.

 



2  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then
the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the
whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and
the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice
of the meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the
stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders or the books of the
corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders
and of the number of shares held by each such stockholder.

7\. _Quorum_.

(a) Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") or these Bylaws, the holders
of a majority of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a
meeting of stockholders. When a quorum is present at the original meeting, any
business which might have been transacted at the original meeting may be
transacted at an adjourned meeting, even when a quorum is not present. In the
absence of a quorum at the opening of any meeting of stockholders, such
meeting may be adjourned from time to time by any officer entitled to preside
at or act as secretary of such meeting or by the vote of a majority of the
shares voting on the motion to adjourn, but no other business may be
transacted until and unless a quorum is present. If later a quorum is present
at an adjourned meeting, then any business may be transacted which might have
been transacted at the original meeting.

 

(b) The stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to
do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of sufficient
stockholders to leave less than a quorum.

8\. _Voting of Shares_.

 

(a) Unless otherwise provided by law or in the Certificate of Incorporation,
each stockholder shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of capital
stock of the Corporation held by such stockholder on each matter submitted to
a vote at a meeting of stockholders.

(b) Except in the election of Directors, when a quorum is present at any
meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject
matter shall be the act of the stockholders on that matter, unless a vote by a
greater number is required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws.

 

(c) Voting on all matters except the election of Directors shall be by voice
vote or by a show of hands.

 

(d) Shares of its own stock owned by the Corporation, directly or indirectly,
through a subsidiary or otherwise, shall not be voted and shall not be
counted in determining the total number of shares entitled to vote; except
that shares held in a fiduciary capacity may be voted and shall be counted to
the extent provided by law.

 



3 9\. _Proxies_. Shares may be voted either in person or by one or more agents
authorized by a written proxy executed by the stockholder or by such
stockholders duly authorized attorney-in-fact. A proxy is not valid after the
expiration of three years from the date of its execution, unless the person
executing it specifies therein the length of time for which it is to continue
in force, or limits its use to a particular meeting. Proxies may be provided
in any form or manner permitted by applicable law.

10\. _Conduct of Meetings_.

(a) _Chairman of Meeting_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by
the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the Chairmans absence by the Vice
Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the Vice Chairmans absence by the Chief
Executive Officer (if one has been duly elected), or in the Chief Executive
Officers absence by the President, or in the Presidents absence by a Vice
President, or in the absence of all of the foregoing persons by a chairman
designed by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by
a chairman chosen by vote of the stockholders at the meeting. The Secretary
shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the Secretarys absence the
chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the
meeting.

(b) _Rules and Procedures_. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution
such rule, regulations and procedures for the conduct of any meeting of
stockholders as it shall deem appropriate including, without limitation, such
guidelines and procedures as it may deem appropriate regarding the
participation by means of remote communication of stockholders and
proxyholders not physically present at a meeting. Except to the extent
inconsistent with such rules, regulations and procedures as adopted by the
Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have
the right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures
and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate
for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulation or procedures,
whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of
the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the
establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules
and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those
present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to
stockholders of record of the corporation, their duly authorized and
constituted proxies or such other persons as shall be determined; (iv)
restriction on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement
thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by
participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors
or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required
to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.

 

11\. _Informal Action by Stockholders_.

(a) Any action which is required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the
stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without
a vote, if a 

 



4  consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed and
dated by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
Such signed and dated consent must be delivered to the Corporation, whether
done before or after the action so taken, but in no event later than sixty
(60) days after the earliest dated consent delivered in accordance with
Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. When corporate action is
taken without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent, prompt notice
shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and
who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to
notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date
that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the
action were delivered to the Corporation.

(b) Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation,
stockholders may act by written consent to elect directors; provided, however,
that, if such consent is less than unanimous, such action by written consent
may be in lieu of holding an annual meeting only if all of the directorships
to which directors could be elected at an annual meeting held at the effective
time of such action are vacant and are filled by such action.

 

(c) Electronic Transmission of Consents. A telegram, cablegram, or other
electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted
by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act
for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and
dated, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic
transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the
Corporation can determine (A) that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic
transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person
or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder and (B) the
date on which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons
transmitted such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on
which such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted
shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent
given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission shall be deemed
to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and
until such paper form shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or
an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to a
corporations registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing
limitations on delivery, consents given by telegram, cablegram or other
electronic transmission may be otherwise delivered to the principal place of
business of the Corporation or to an officer or agent of the Corporation
having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders
are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the
Board of Directors. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a
consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used,
provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing.

 



5 _ARTICLE III_

 

 _DIRECTORS_

1\. _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed by the Board of Directors or by such committees as the Board of
Directors may establish pursuant to these Bylaws. 

2\. _Number, Term and Qualification_. Except as otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, the number of Directors which shall constitute
the whole Board of Directors shall be determined from time to time by
resolution of the stockholders or the Board of Directors, but in no event
shall be less than one (1). Each Director shall hold office until
such Directors death, resignation, retirement, removal, disqualification, or
such Directors successor is elected and qualifies. Directors need not be
residents of the State of Delaware or stockholders of the Corporation.

 

3\. _Election of Directors_. Except as provided in Section 5 of this Article
III and unless directors are elected by written consent in lieu of an annual
meeting, the Directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders.
Those persons who receive the highest number of votes shall be deemed to have
been elected. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation,
election of Directors shall be by written ballot. Any requirement of a written
ballot shall be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission,
provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or
be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the
electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxyholder.

__4. _Removal; Resignation_. Directors may be removed from office with or
without cause by a vote of stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote at an election of Directors. If a director is elected
by a voting group of stockholders, only the stockholders of that voting group
may participate in the vote to remove him. If any Directors are so removed,
new Directors may be elected at the same meeting. Any Director may resign by
delivering a resignation in writing or by electronic transmission to the
Corporation at its principal office or to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary. Such resignation shall be
effective upon receipt unless it is specified to be effective at some later
time or upon the happening of some later time or upon the happening of some
later event. __

5\. _Vacancies_. A vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors, including,
without limitation, a vacancy created by an increase in the authorized number
of Directors or resulting from the stockholders failure to elect the full
authorized number of Directors, may be filled by a vote of a majority of the
Directors then in office or, if the Directors remaining in office constitute
less than a quorum of the Directors, by the affirmative vote of a majority of
all remaining Directors or by the sole remaining Director. If the vacant
office was held by a Director elected by a voting group, only the remaining
Director or Directors elected by that voting group or the holders of shares
of that voting group are entitled to fill the vacancy. A Director elected to
fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of such Directors
predecessor in office. The stockholders may elect a Director at any time to
fill any vacancy not filled by the Directors.

 



6 6\. _Compensation_. The Board of Directors may provide for the compensation
of Directors for their services as such and may provide for the payment of
any and all expenses incurred by the Directors in connection with such
services.

7\. _Committees_.

(a) The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the
Directors then in office, may designate one or more committees, each committee
to consist of one or more of the Directors of the Corporation. The Board of
Directors may designate one or more Directors as alternate members of any
committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of
the committee. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of
the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers
and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and
affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to
be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall
have the power or authority in reference to (a) adopting, amending or
repealing any bylaw of the Corporation or (b) approving or adopting, or
recommending to the stockholders any action or matter expressly required by
law to be submitted to stockholders for approval. Such committee or
committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to
time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. Each committee shall
keep regular minutes of its meetings and make such reports to the Board of
Directors as the Board of Directors may request. Except as the Board of
Directors may otherwise determine, any committee may make rules for the
conduct of its business, but unless otherwise provided by the Directors or in
such rules, its business shall be conducted as nearly as possible in the same
manner as is provided in these Bylaws for the conduct of its business by the
Board of Directors.

(b) Any resolutions adopted or other action taken by any such committee within
the scope of the authority delegated to it by the Board of Directors shall be
deemed for all purposes to be adopted or taken by the Board of Directors. The
designation of any committee and the delegation thereto of authority shall not
operate to relieve the Board of Directors, or any member thereof, of any
responsibility or liability imposed upon it or him by law. 

(c) If a committee member is absent or disqualified, the qualified members
present at a meeting, even if not a quorum, may unanimously appoint another
Board of Directors member to act in the absent or disqualified members place.

(d) Regular meetings of any such committee may be held without notice at such
time and place as such committee may fix from time to time by resolution.
Special meetings of any such committee may be called by any member thereof
upon not less than two days notice stating the place, date and hour of such
meeting, which notice may be given by any usual means of communication. Any
member of a committee may waive notice of any meeting and no notice of any
meeting need be given to any member thereof who attends in person. The notice
of a committee meeting need not state the business proposed to be transacted
at the meeting.

 



7 (e) A majority of the members of any such committee shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business at any meeting thereof, and actions of such
committee must be authorized by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
members of such committee.

(f) Any member of any such committee may be removed at any time with or
without cause by resolution adopted by a majority of the Board of Directors.

 

(g) Any such committee shall elect a presiding officer from among its members
and may fix its own rules of procedure which shall not be inconsistent with
these Bylaws. It shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report the
same to the Board of Directors for its information at the meeting thereof held
next after the proceedings shall have been taken.

 

 _ARTICLE IV_

_MEETINGS OF DIRECTORS_

1\. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be
held at such time and place as shall be determined from time to time by the
Board of Directors. If an annual meeting of the stockholders is convened, a
regular meeting of the Board of Directors may be held immediately after, and
at the same place as, the annual meeting of stockholders.

2\. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be
called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board (if one has been duly
elected), the President, the Chief Executive Officer (if one has been duly
elected) or any two Directors.

 

3\. _Notice of Meetings_.

(a) Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice.

(b) The person or persons calling a special meeting of the Board of Directors
shall, at least two days before the meeting, give notice thereof by any usual
means of communication. Such notice need not specify the business to be

11 _ARTICLE VII_

 

 _CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES AND OTHER TRANSFERS_

__1. _Certificates for Shares_. Certificates representing shares of the
Corporation shall be issued, in such form as the Board of Directors shall
determine, to every stockholder for the fully paid shares owned by him,
provided that the Board of Directors may provide that some or all of any or
all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares.
Certificates shall be signed by the Chairman or Vice-Chairman, if any, of
the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or any
Vice President of the Corporation, and by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary,
Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer and sealed with the seal of the Corporation
or a facsimile thereof. The signatures of any such officers upon a
certificate may be facsimiles or may be engraved or printed or omitted if the
certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent, or registered by a
registrar, other than the Corporation itself or an employee of the
Corporation. In case any officer who has signed or whose facsimile or other
signature has been placed upon such certificate shall have ceased to be such
officer before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation
with the same effect as if he or she were such officer at the date of its
issue. The certificates shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise
identified; and the name and address of the persons to whom they are issued,
with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on the stock
transfer books of the Corporation. __

2\. _Transfer of Shares_. Transfer of shares shall be made on the stock
transfer books of the Corporation only upon surrender of the certificates for
the shares sought to be transferred by the record holder thereof or by such
holders duly authorized agent, transferee or legal representative. All
certificates surrendered for transfer shall be canceled before new
certificates for the transferred shares shall be issued.

3\. _Transfer Agent and Registrar_. The Board of Directors may appoint one or
more transfer agents and one or more registrars of transfer and may require
all stock certificates to be signed or countersigned by the transfer agent
and registered by the registrar of transfers.

4\. _Closing Transfer Books and Fixing Record Date_.

(a) For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or
to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor
less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is
fixed by the Board of Directors, such record date shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. Such determination of stockholders of record
shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the
Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

(b) For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is 

 



12  adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten
(10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the
Board of Directors, such record date, when no prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by this chapter, shall be the first date on which a
signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken
is filed with the Secretary of the Corporation. If no record date has been
fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is
required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, such record date shall
be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts
the resolution taking such prior action.

(c) For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to receive
payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or
the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior
to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 

__5. _Lost Certificates_. The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of
a new share certificate in place of a certificate claimed to have been lost
or destroyed, upon receipt of an affidavit of such fact from the person
claiming the loss or destruction. When authorizing such issuance of a new
certificate, the Board of Directors may require the claimant to give the
Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct to indemnify the Corporation
against loss from any claim with respect to the certificate claimed to have
been lost or destroyed, or otherwise to indemnify the Corporation against such
loss; or the Board of Directors may, by resolution reciting that the
circumstances justify such action, authorize the issuance of the new
certificate without requiring such a bond. __

 

6\. _Holder of Record_. The Corporation may treat as absolute owner of the
shares the person in whose name the shares stand of record on its books just
as if that person had full competency, capacity, and authority to exercise all
rights of ownership irrespective of any knowledge or notice to the contrary or
any description indicating a representative, pledge or other
fiduciary relation or any reference to any other instrument or to the rights
of any other person appearing upon its record or upon the share certificate;
except that any person furnishing to the Corporation proof of his/her
appointment as a fiduciary shall be treated as if he or she were a holder of
record of the Corporations shares.

7\. _Treasury Shares_. Treasury shares of the Corporation shall consist of
such shares as have been issued and thereafter acquired but not canceled by
the Corporation. Treasury shares shall not carry voting or dividend rights,
except rights in share dividends.

 



13 _ARTICLE VIII_

 

 _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

1\. _Dividends_. The Board of Directors may from time to time declare, and the
Corporation may pay, dividends on its outstanding shares in the manner and
upon the terms and conditions provided by law and by the Certificate of
Incorporation.

2\. _Seal_. The corporate seal shall be in such form as may be approved
from time to time by the Board of Directors. Such seal may be an impression
or stamp and may be used by the officers of the Corporation by causing it, or
a facsimile thereof, to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner
reproduced. In addition to any form of seal adopted by the Board of
Directors, the officers of the Corporation may use as the corporate seal a
seal in the form of a circle containing the name of the Corporation and the
state of its incorporation (or an abbreviation thereof) on the circumference
and the word "Seal" in the center.

3\. _Waiver of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required to be given to any
stockholder or Director under the provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law or under the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing signed by the person or persons
entitled to such notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person
entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be
equivalent to the giving of such notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person
attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor
the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders, Directors,
or members of a committee of Directors need be specified in any written waiver
of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

4\. _Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be determined by
the Board of Directors.

5\. _Notice by Electronic Transmission_. Without limiting the manner by
which notice may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to
stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, other than those enumerated in Section 232(e) of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, in the Certificate of Incorporation, or
these Bylaws, shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission
consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Electronic
transmission shall mean any form of communication, including but not limited
to facsimile telecommunication and electronic mail, not directly involving the
physical transmission of paper, that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed
by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by
such a recipient.

6\. _Form of Records_. Any records maintained by the Corporation in the
regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account,
and minute books, may be kept on, or by means of, or be in the form of, any
information storage device or method, provided that the records so kept can be
converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable time. The
Corporation shall so convert any records so kept upon the request of any
person entitled to inspect the same.

 



14 7\. _Amendments_. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Bylaws may be
amended or repealed and new Bylaws may be adopted by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Corporation, or, if the
Certificate of Incorporation so permits, by the affirmative vote of a majority
of the Directors then holding office at any regular or special meeting of the
Board of Directors or by unanimous written consent.

8\. All terms used in these Bylaws shall be deemed to refer to the masculine,
feminine, neuter, singular or plural as the context may require.

 

THIS IS TO CERTIFY that the above Bylaws were duly adopted by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, effective the  day of May, 2012.

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (" _Agreement_ "), dated as of [ ],
2012, is by and among Cornerstone Therapeutics Inc., a Delaware corporation ("

Representative_ " and, collectively with Parent, the " _Escrow Parties_ "),
and BNY Mellon, National Association, a national banking association with its
principal place of business at BNY Mellon Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15258 (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ").

Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the
meaning set forth in that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), dated as of May 14, 2012, by and among Parent, Stone
Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Merger Sub_ "), EKR
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ") and EKR
Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Operating Company_ ").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the Parties have agreed to merge the Merger Sub with and into the
Company, whereby as a result the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and the Operating Company shall remain a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (and a lower tier subsidiary of
Parent), pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement;

WHEREAS, the parties (other than the Escrow Agent) have agreed to enter into
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ of the Merger Agreement and this
is the "Escrow Agreement" referred to in the Merger Agreement;

WHEREAS, pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ of the Merger Agreement, Parent has
agreed to deposit with the Escrow Agent at the Closing (i) Twelve Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($12,500,000) (the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ ")
and (ii) $1,500,000 (the " _Working Capital and Severance Escrow Amount_ "),
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, each of which shall be held
in a segregated account designated the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ " and the "
_Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund_ ," respectively;

WHEREAS, pursuant to _Section 10.16_ of the Merger Agreement, the Company
Holders have appointed the Stockholder Representative to act on their behalf
with respect to matters pursuant to the Merger Agreement and this Agreement;
and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to set forth their understandings with regard to
the escrow account established by this Agreement.

 



1 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:

1\. _Appointment._

(a) _Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Parties appoint the Escrow Agent as their
agent to hold in escrow, and to administer the disposition of, the Escrow Fund
(as defined below) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and the
Escrow Agent accepts such appointment.

 

(b) _Stockholder Representative_. The Stockholder Representative represents
and warrants to the Escrow Agent that it has been duly appointed as
Stockholder Representative and has the power and authority to (i) enter into
this Agreement, (ii) perform the obligations of the Stockholder Representative
hereunder and (iii) take any and all actions and make any decisions required
or permitted to be made by the Stockholder Representative under this
Agreement. In the event that the Stockholder Representative is removed or
becomes unable or unwilling to continue in its capacity as Stockholder
Representative, or if the Stockholder Representative resigns as a Stockholder
Representative, the provisions in _Sections 10.16(g)_ and _10.16(h)_ of the
Merger Agreement shall control the appointment of a new Stockholder
Representative and, once appointed (written notice of which shall be provided
to the Escrow Agent) the new Stockholder Representative shall be bound by all
of the terms of this Agreement. Nevertheless, any new Stockholder
Representative hereunder shall, in writing to the Parent and Escrow Agent,
expressly confirm his, her or its assumption of all applicable rights and
obligations hereunder. The Escrow Agent may rely upon any decision, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative received by the Escrow Agent in
connection with this Agreement, and is relieved from any liability to any
person for any acts performed in accordance with any such decision, consent or
instruction. The Escrow Agent may rely, without inquiry, upon any written
notice from the existing Stockholder Representative of the appointment of any
successor Stockholder Representative, and may deal with any such Stockholder
Representative with respect to the escrow created by this Agreement.

 

2\. _Establishment of Escrow._ Upon the execution of this Agreement, Parent
shall deposit $14,000,000 in immediately available funds with the Escrow
Agent (the " _Initial Deposit_ "), with amounts designated for each of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund, and the
Escrow Agent shall promptly, upon request, acknowledge to the Escrow Parties,
or any of them, receipt of any funds so deposited. The Indemnity Escrow Fund
and the Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund shall be held as two
separate trust funds, segregated from all other monies held by the Escrow
Agent on behalf of itself and others, and shall not be subject to any lien,
attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of
any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes of and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.
Additionally, upon execution of this Agreement, one of the Escrow Parties
shall deliver one fully executed copy of this Agreement to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the Notice section below. The Initial Deposit and all
additional amounts now or hereafter deposited with the Escrow Agent (if any),
together with all interest, dividends and other income earned, shall be
referred to as the " _Escrow Fund_." The Escrow Parties acknowledge that the
sum held in escrow hereunder may be reduced or increased from time to time
during the term hereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Accordingly,
the term "Escrow Fund" shall refer both to the Initial Deposit and to
such lesser or greater amount as may be held pursuant hereto at any point
during the term hereof.

 



2 3\. _Customer Identification and TIN Certification._

 

(a) To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify
and record information that identifies each individual or entity that opens an
account. Therefore, the Escrow Agent must obtain the name, address, taxpayer
or other government identification number, and other information, such as
date of birth for individuals, for each individual and business entity that is
a party to this Agreement. For individuals signing this Agreement on their own
behalf or on behalf of another, the Escrow Agent requires a copy of
a drivers license, passport or other form of photo identification. For a
business entity and other entities that are parties to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agent will require such documents, as it deems necessary to confirm the
legal existence of the entity.

(b) At the time of or prior to execution of this Agreement, any Escrow Party
providing a tax identification number for tax reporting purposes shall
provide to the Escrow Agent a completed IRS Form W-9 (or the appropriate IRS
Form W-8, in the case of non U.S. persons), and every individual executing
this Agreement on behalf of an Escrow Party shall provide to the Escrow Agent
a copy of a drivers license, passport or other form of photo identification
acceptable to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Parties agree to provide to the
Escrow Agent such organizational documents and documents establishing the
authority of any individual acting in a representative capacity as the Escrow
Agent may require in order to comply with its established practices,
procedures and policies.

(c) The Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to report all interest and
other income earned on the Escrow Fund in accordance with the Form W-9 (or the
appropriate IRS Form W-8, in the case of non U.S. persons) information
provided to the Escrow Agent by Parent. The Escrow Parties understand that, in
the event one or more tax identification numbers is not certified to the
Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may be required by the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the " _Code_ "), and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, to withhold a portion of any interest or
other income earned on the Escrow Fund.

 

(d) The Escrow Parties agree to treat all amounts in the Escrow Fund as owned
by Parent for all tax purposes and to file all tax returns consistently with
such treatment. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall report all interest
or other income, if any, that is earned on the Escrow Funds as income of
Parent in the taxable year or years in which such income is properly
includable and shall pay any and all taxes attributable thereto.
Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5_ to the contrary, within ten (10) days
after the end of each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement,
beginning with the calendar quarter ending on [June 30, 2012], the Escrow
Agent shall release from the Escrow Fund and deliver to Parent an amount equal
to the earnings on the Escrow Fund for such prior calendar quarter; provided,
that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to Parent, the Stockholder
Representative, or any other party for failing to timely make any quarterly
distribution in accordance with this sentence. In the event that the Escrow
Agent fails to make a quarterly distribution of the earnings on the Escrow
Fund required pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent may
deliver to the Escrow Agent a written request that such distribution be made
and the Escrow Agent shall make such 

 



3  distribution to Parent, in accordance with Parents written instructions,
within three (3) business days after receipt of such notice. The Escrow Agent
shall have no obligation to distribute interest or other income earned with
respect to the Escrow Fund until such interest or other income becomes due and
payable in accordance with the terms of the account in which such Escrow Fund
is deposited pursuant to  _Section 4_ below. Any payments of funds from the
Escrow Fund shall be subject to applicable withholding and reporting
regulations then in force in the United States or any other jurisdictions, if
applicable, including the filing of information returns with the Internal
Revenue Service and the issuance of IRS Form 1099 to and in the name of
Parent.

(e) The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to prepare or file any information
reports (including without limitation IRS Forms 1099-B) other than such
information reports of interest earned on the Escrow Fund as the Escrow Agent
is required to prepare and file in the ordinary course of its business.

4\. _Deposit of the Escrow Fund._ The Escrow Agent shall deposit the Escrow
Fund in deposit accounts at BNY Mellon, National Association in accordance
with the joint written instructions and directions as may from time to time be
provided to the Escrow Agent in writing by the Stockholder Representative and
Parent. In the event that the Escrow Agent does not receive such written
instructions, the Escrow Agent shall deposit the Escrow Fund in business money
market accounts at BNY Mellon, National Association. Deposits shall in all
instances be subject to the Escrow Agents standard funds availability
policy. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any loss due to interest
rate fluctuation or early withdrawal penalty. The Escrow Parties understand
that deposits of the Escrow Fund are not necessarily insured by the United
States Government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or of any state or
municipality, and that such deposits do not necessarily earn a fixed rate of
return. In no instance shall the Escrow Agent have any obligation to provide
investment advice of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable or
responsible for any loss resulting from any deposits made pursuant to this
_Section 4_, other than as a result of the gross negligence, fraud or
willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent.

5\. _Release of the Escrow Funds._ The Escrow Fund shall secure the
indemnification obligations of the Company Holders and payments by the
Company Holders of the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and Severance
Adjustment Amount, each as more particularly described in the Merger
Agreement. This Agreement shall not change, modify or supersede in any way
the events or circumstances that give rise to the obligations and/or remedies
of the parties to the Merger Agreement as more particularly set forth therein.
Other than disbursement of interest amounts or payment of fees as set forth
in this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall only disburse amounts from the
Escrow Fund as follows:

(a) _Indemnity Escrow Fund_. The Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be used to pay
to Parent (i) amounts due for any indemnification claims made pursuant to and
to the extent provided in Article IX of the Merger Agreement when agreed upon
or resolved in accordance with this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.
Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 5(b)(ii)_, the Indemnity Escrow
Fund shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent only in accordance with the
following:

 

(i) _Indemnity Claims Generally_. From time to time before [ ],
201[ ] (the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund Release Date_ "), Parent may give
notice (the " _Indemnification Notice_ ") to the Stockholder Representative
and the Escrow Agent specifying the nature and dollar amount (to the extent
known) of any claim for indemnification under Article IX of the Merger
Agreement. If the Stockholder Representative does not deliver notice
to Parent and the Escrow Agent disputing such claim (a " _Claim Objection_ ")
within twenty (20) days after the Stockholder Representatives receipt of such
Indemnification Notice, then at the end of such 20-day period,
the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have acknowledged and
agreed with the correctness of such Indemnification Notice for the full amount
set forth therein and shall thereafter be precluded from disputing such amount
and the Escrow Agent shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) business
days) deliver to Parent the payment in the dollar amount of the claim in the
Indemnification Notice from the Indemnity Escrow Fund. The Escrow Agent shall
not, and shall have no obligation to, inquire into or consider whether a
claim complies with the requirements of the Merger Agreement.

 



4 (ii) _Disputes of Indemnification Claims_. If the Stockholder Representative
provides to Parent and the Escrow Agent a Claim Objection within the
timeframe set forth in Section 5(a)(i) above with respect to a claim, the
Escrow Agent shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) business days)
make payment with respect to such Indemnification Notice in such amount as
not objected to by the Stockholder Representative. With respect to any
disputed amount in the Claim Objection, the Escrow Agent shall make payment
only (1) in accordance with joint written instructions of Parent and the
Stockholder Representative or (2) after a final decision and non-appealable
judgment or award has been rendered by a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction to enforce an award with respect to the amount of such claim and
then in accordance with such decision, in each case promptly (and in any case
within two (2) business days) after its receipt of such joint written
instruction, order, judgment, or decree. If the Escrow Agent obeys or
complies with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow
Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person
by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or
decree being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or
found to have been entered without jurisdiction. Any such claim that is the
subject of a Claim Objection shall be considered an Unresolved Claim (as
defined below in Section 5(d)) with respect to the disputed amount until
resolution in accordance with clause (1) or (2) above.

(b) _Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund_. The Working Capital and
Severance Escrow Fund shall be used to secure payments by the Company Holders
of the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount and Severance Adjustment Amount
pursuant to and to the extent provided in  _Section 2.10_ of the Merger
Agreement when agreed upon or resolved in accordance with this Agreement and
the Merger Agreement. The Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund shall be
disbursed by the Escrow Agent only in accordance with the following:

(i) _Payment of Adjustment Amount_. Prior to [ ], 201[ ] (the "
_Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund Release Date_ "), if Parent is
entitled to an Adjustment Amount payment (and thus entitled to a distribution
from the Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section
2.10(d)_ of the Merger Agreement), then within three

 



5  (3) business days after the date on which the Conclusive Statement and the
Conclusive Adjustment Statement (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) are
either agreed upon by Parent and the Stockholder Representative or are
delivered by the Neutral Accounting Arbitrator, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall jointly notify the Escrow Agent of Parents entitlement
to a payment of the Adjustment Amount and the amount of such payment (an "
_Adjustment Payment Notice_ "). On the second (2nd) business day following the
Escrow Agents receipt of the Adjustment Payment Notice, the Escrow Agent
shall distribute to Parent from the Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund
an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount specified in the Adjustment Payment
Notice by means of wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent.

 

(ii) _Payment of Severance Adjustment Amount_. Prior to the Working Capital
and Severance Escrow Fund Release Date, if Parent is entitled to a Severance
Adjustment Amount payment (and thus entitled to a distribution from the
Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 2.10(g)_ of
the Merger Agreement), then the Parent and Stockholder Representative shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release to Parent
from the Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund (and, to the extent the
Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund is insufficient, the
Indemnity Escrow Fund) an amount in cash equal to such Severance Adjustment
Amount. On the second (2nd) business day following the Escrow Agents receipt
of the joint written instructions, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Parent
from the Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund (and, to the extent the
Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund is insufficient, the Indemnity
Escrow Fund) an amount equal to the Severance Adjustment Amount specified in
the joint written instructions by means of wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of  _Sections 5(a)_ and _5(b)_ above, if
at any time Parent and the Stockholder Representative jointly execute and
deliver a written instruction in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_
attached hereto, the Escrow Agent shall disburse such portion of the Escrow
Fund as referred to in such joint written instruction in accordance with the
directions contained therein.

(d) With respect to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, upon the Indemnity Escrow Fund
Release Date, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Indemnity Escrow Fund Release
Amount to the Stockholder Representative (or as otherwise directed in writing
by the Stockholder Representative). " _Indemnity Escrow Fund Release Amount_ "
shall mean the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund less an amount (up to the
total amount then held by the Escrow Agent) equal to the amount of claims for
indemnification asserted prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period but not yet resolved (each an " _Unresolved Claim_ "). The Indemnity
Escrow Funds retained for Unresolved Claims shall be released by the Escrow
Agent (to the extent not utilized to pay Parent for any such claims resolved
in favor of Parent) upon their resolution in accordance with Article IX of the
Merger Agreement and the terms of this Agreement.

 

(e) With respect to the Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund, upon the
Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund Release Date, the Escrow Agent
shall disburse the funds in the Working Capital and Severance Escrow Fund in
accordance with the joint written instructions provided by Parent and the
Stockholder Representative.

 



6 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any amount
to be released at any time or under any circumstances exceeds the balance in
the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall release the balance in the Escrow Fund
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and shall have no liability or
responsibility to the Escrow Parties for any deficiency, subject to _Section
4_.

6\. _Methods of Payment._ All payments required to be made by the Escrow
Agent under this Agreement shall be made by wire transfer or by cashiers
check in accordance with written payment instructions provided to the Escrow
Agent by the party receiving the funds. Any wire transfers shall be made
subject to, and in accordance with, the Escrow Agents normal funds transfer
procedures in effect from time to time. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon all bank and account information provided to the Escrow Agent by any
of the Escrow Parties. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to verify or
otherwise confirm any written wire transfer instructions but it may do so in
its discretion on any occasion without incurring any liability to any of the
Escrow Parties for failing to do so on any other occasion. The Escrow Agent
shall process all wire transfers based on bank identification and account
numbers rather than the names of the intended recipient of the funds, even if
such numbers pertain to a recipient other than the recipient identified in
the payment instructions. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to detect any
such inconsistencies and shall resolve any such inconsistencies by using the
account number.

 

7\. _Responsibilities and Liability of the Escrow Agent._

(a) _Duties Limited._ The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties
as are expressly set forth in this Agreement. The Escrow Agents duties shall
be determined only with reference to this Agreement and applicable laws and
it shall have no implied duties. The Escrow Agent shall not be bound by,
deemed to have knowledge of, or have any obligation to make inquiry into or
consider, any term or provision of any agreement between any of the Escrow
Parties and/or any other third party or as to which the escrow relationship
created by this Agreement relates, including without limitation any documents
referenced in this Agreement.

 

(b) _Limitations on Liability of the Escrow Agent._

(i) Except in cases of the Escrow Agents bad faith, willful misconduct or
gross negligence, the Escrow Agent shall be fully protected (x) in acting in
reliance upon any certificate, statement, request, notice, advice,
instruction, direction, other agreement or instrument or signature reasonably
and in good faith believed by the Escrow Agent to be genuine, (y) in assuming
that any person purporting to give the Escrow Agent any of the foregoing in
connection with either this Agreement or the Escrow Agents duties, has been
duly authorized to do so, and (z) in acting or failing to act in good faith on
the advice of any counsel retained by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for any mistake of fact or law or any error of judgment,
or for any act or omission, except as a result of its bad faith, willful
misconduct or gross negligence. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for
any loss incurred upon any action taken under circumstances not constituting
bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence.

 



7 (ii) In connection with any payments that the Escrow Agent is instructed to
make by wire transfer, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the acts or
omissions of (y) any Escrow Party or other person providing such instructions,
including without limitation errors as to the amount, bank information or bank
account number; or (z) any other person or entity, including without
limitation any Federal Reserve Bank, any transmission or communications
facility, any funds transfer system, any receiver or receiving depository
financial institution, and no such person or entity shall be deemed to be an
agent of the Escrow Agent.

(iii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that in
no event will the Escrow Agent be liable for any lost profits or other
indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages which the parties may
incur or experience by reason of having entered into or relied on this
Agreement or arising out of or in connection with the Escrow Agents
services, even if the Escrow Agent was advised or otherwise made aware of the
possibility of such damages; nor shall the Escrow Agent be liable for acts of
God, acts of war, breakdowns or malfunctions of machines or computers,
interruptions or malfunctions of communications or power supplies, labor
difficulties, actions of public authorities, or any other similar cause or
catastrophe beyond the Escrow Agents reasonable control. 

(iv) In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or
rights under this Agreement, or shall receive any certificate, statement,
request, notice, advice, instruction, direction or other agreement or
instrument from any other party with respect to the Escrow Fund which, in the
Escrow Agents reasonable and good faith opinion, is in conflict with any of
the provisions of this Agreement, or shall be advised that a dispute has
arisen with respect to the Escrow Fund or any part thereof, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled, without liability to any person, to refrain from taking any
action other than to keep safely the Escrow Fund until the Escrow Agent shall
be directed otherwise in accordance with a Joint Direction or an order of a
court with jurisdiction over the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be under
no duty to institute or defend any legal proceedings, although the Escrow
Agent may, in its discretion and at the expense of the Escrow Parties as
provided in subsections (c) or (d) immediately below, institute or defend such
proceedings.

 

(c) _Indemnification of the Escrow Agent._ The Escrow Parties severally and
jointly agree to indemnify the Escrow Agent for, and to hold it harmless
against, any and all claims, suits, actions, proceedings, investigations,
judgments, deficiencies, damages, settlements, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses of attorneys chosen by the
Escrow Agent) as and when incurred, arising out of or based upon any act,
omission, alleged act or alleged omission by the Escrow Agent or any other
cause, in any case in connection with the acceptance of, or performance or
non-performance by the Escrow Agent of, any of the Escrow Agents duties
under this Agreement, except as a result of the Escrow Agents bad faith,
willful misconduct or gross negligence (" _Agent Claims_ "). As between the
Escrow Parties, any Agent Claims payable hereunder shall be paid one-half by
Parent, on the one hand, and one-half by the Stockholder Representative, on
the other hand.

 



8 (d) _Authority to Interplead._ The Escrow Parties authorize the Escrow Agent,
if the Escrow Agent is threatened with litigation or is sued, to interplead
all interested parties in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of
any dispute under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
petition a court of competent jurisdiction and shall perform any acts ordered
by such court.

8\. _Termination._ This Agreement and all the obligations of the Escrow Agent
under this Agreement shall terminate upon the release of the entire Escrow
Fund by the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Agreement.

9\. _Removal of the Escrow Agent._ The Escrow Parties acting together shall
have the right to terminate the appointment of the Escrow Agent, specifying
the date upon which such termination shall take effect. Thereafter, the
Escrow Agent shall have no further obligation to the Escrow Parties except to
hold the Escrow Fund as depository and not otherwise. The Escrow Parties agree
that they will jointly appoint a banking corporation, trust company or
attorney as successor escrow agent. The Escrow Agent shall refrain from taking
any action until it shall receive joint written instructions from the Escrow
Parties designating the successor escrow agent. The Escrow Agent shall deliver
all of the then remaining balance of the Escrow Fund to such successor escrow
agent in accordance with such instructions and upon receipt of the Escrow
Fund, the successor escrow agent shall be bound by all of the provisions of
this Agreement.

 

10\. _Resignation of the Escrow Agent._ The Escrow Agent may resign and be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder at any time by giving no
less than ten (10) business days prior written notice of such resignation to
the Escrow Parties, specifying the date when such resignation will take effect
provided that such resignation shall not become effective until a successor
escrow agent shall have been appointed in accordance with this _Section 10_
and shall have accepted such appointment in writing. Thereafter, the Escrow
Agent shall have no further obligation to the Escrow Parties except to hold
the Escrow Fund as depository and not otherwise. In the event of such
resignation, the Escrow Parties agree that they will jointly appoint a banking
corporation, trust company, or attorney as successor escrow agent within
ten (10) business days of notice of such resignation. The Escrow Agent shall
refrain from taking any action until it shall receive joint written
instructions from the Escrow Parties designating the successor escrow agent.
The Escrow Agent shall deliver all of the then remaining balance of the
Escrow Fund to such successor escrow agent in accordance with such
instructions and upon receipt of the Escrow Fund, the successor escrow agent
shall be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement.

11\. _Accounting._ On a monthly basis, the Escrow Agent shall render a written
statement setting forth the balance of the Escrow Fund, all interest earned
and all distributions made, which statements shall be delivered to the
addresses set forth in _Section 14_ below.

12\. _Survival._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the provisions of _Section 7_ shall survive any resignation or removal of the
Escrow Agent, and any termination of this Agreement.

 



9 13\. _Escrow Agent Fees, Costs, and Expenses._ From the date hereof through
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8_ herein, the
Escrow Agent shall charge a monthly maintenance fee of $15 per month and be
entitled to be reimbursed for its customary and reasonable fees and charges
for any wire transfers or other depository services rendered in connection
with the Escrow Fund and any delivery charges or other out of pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the Escrow Fund, all of which shall be paid in
order of priority, first, from interest earned on the Escrow Fund, second,
from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and, third, from the Working Capital and
Severance Escrow Fund. The Escrow Parties acknowledge their joint and several
obligations to pay any fees, expenses and other amounts owed to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to this Agreement, provided that as between the Escrow Parties,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall each be responsible for one-
half of such fees, expenses and other amounts. The Escrow Parties agree that
the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to pay itself for any fees, expenses or
other amounts owed to the Escrow Agent out of the amounts held in the Escrow
Fund and grant to the Escrow Agent a first priority security interest in the
Escrow Fund to secure all obligations owed by them to the Escrow Agent under
this Agreement. The Escrow Parties further agree that the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to withhold any distribution otherwise required to be made from
the Escrow Fund if any fees, expenses or other amounts owed to the Escrow
Agent remain unpaid on the date such distribution would otherwise be made.

 

14\. _Notices, Contact Information._ All notices or other communications
required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be transmitted

Pursuant to _Section 5(c)_ of that certain Escrow Agreement dated as of May

_Stockholder Representative_ " and, collectively with Parent, the " _Escrow
Parties_ "), and BNY Mellon, National Association, a national banking
association with its principal place of business at BNY Mellon Center,
Pittsburgh, PA 15258 (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), Parent and the undersigned

---|---|--- 
 



5 Section 1.5 _Proportionate Share of Indemnification_.

 



     | 1.5.1 | Each Company Holder agrees to pay his, her or its
allocable share of any claims for indemnification required to be paid under
the Merger Agreement to Parent or pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ of the Merger
Agreement and not otherwise to be satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or

promptly, upon written request of the Stockholder Representative, remit such
allocable share to the Stockholder Representative (or as otherwise directed by
the Stockholder Representative) and authorize and direct the Stockholder
Representative to further distribute (or cause to be distributed) all such
amounts received from the Company Holder pursuant to this _Section 1.5.1_ to
Parent pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ of the Merger Agreement. In the event that a
Company Holder fails to fulfill his, her or its obligation pursuant to this 
_Section 1.5.1_, the Stockholder Representative may direct the Escrow Agent
or the Agent, as the case may be, to retain and remit to the Stockholder
Representative such amount from any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund and
Contingent Consideration that would otherwise be payable to such Company
Holder, and promptly thereafter the Stockholder Representative shall further
distribute such amounts received from the Company Holder pursuant to this
_Section 1.4.1_ to Parent pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ of the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | 1.5.2 | In the event that the Stockholder Representative receives
all or any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Consideration, the Working Capital
and Severance Escrow Consideration or the Contingent Consideration
(collectively, the "Holdbacks") and at the time of receipt either (i) there is
a pending claim by Parent under _ARTICLE IX_ of the Merger Agreement or there
remains outstanding one or more Scheduled Indemnity Matters or other Special
Indemnified Claims, or (ii) the Stockholder Representative believes in its
good faith judgment that Parent may make a claim, or there may be a Third
Party Claim, in the future, then the Stockholder Representative may retain
the Holdbacks or any portion thereof and contribute such amounts to the
Stockholder Representative Escrow Fund, to be held, utilized and paid in
accordance with _Section 3_ hereof.  
---|---|--- 

Section 2.1 _Indemnification of Stockholder Representative_. Each Company
Holder agrees that: 



     | 2.1.1 |

The Company Holders, severally, and not jointly, shall, and each hereby does,
indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative and each member of
the Stockholder Representative Advisory Committee (the "Committee") and their
respective members, managers, officers, agents and other representatives from
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses,
including, without limitation, reasonable costs of investigation and counsel
fees and disbursements ("Costs") which may be 

---|---|--- 
 



6 the Committee or incurred by them in connection with the performance of their
respective duties hereunder, including, without limitation, any litigation
involving the subject matter hereof, provided that in the event it is finally
adjudicated that any Costs or any portion thereof were incurred as a result of
the Stockholder Representatives or such member of the Committees actions or
omissions constituting fraud, willful misrepresentation with the intent to
deceive or misconduct, the Stockholder Representative or member of the
Committee will reimburse the Company Holders the amount of such
indemnified Costs attributable to such fraud, willful misrepresentation with
the intent to deceive or misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder
Representative or such member of the Committee by the Company Holders, any
such Costs may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative (and, as
appropriate, paid to such member of the Committee) from (i) the funds in the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund, (ii) the portions of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount and the Working Capital and Severance Escrow Amount otherwise
distributable to the Company Holders pursuant to the terms hereof and the
Escrow Agreement at the time of distribution in accordance with written
instructions delivered by the Stockholder Representative to the Escrow Agent,
and (iii) from any Contingent Consideration actually payable to the Company
Holders pursuant to written instructions delivered by the Stockholder
Representative to Parent; provided that while this section allows the
Stockholder Representative and members of the Committee to be paid from the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund, the Indemnity Escrow Amount, the
Working Capital and Severance Escrow Amount Escrow Fund and the Contingent
Consideration, this does not relieve the Company Holders from their
obligation to promptly pay such Costs as they are suffered or incurred, nor
does it prevent the Stockholder Representative or members of the Committee
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.  
---|--- 



     | 2.1.2 |

In performing any of their respective duties as Stockholder Representative or
member of the Committee, or upon the claimed failure to perform any of the
duties hereunder, no Stockholder Representative or member of the Committee
shall be liable to any Company Holder for any damages, losses, expenses or
Costs which may be incurred as a result of the Stockholder Representative or
member of the Committee so acting or failing to act, except for matters
involving actions or omissions constituting fraud, willful misrepresentation
with the intent to deceive or misconduct. In furtherance, but not by way of
limitation, of the foregoing, no Stockholder Representative, in such
capacity, or member of the Committee shall incur liability to any Company
Holder with respect to (i) the performance of any duties imposed upon such
Stockholder Representative or member of the Committee or failure to perform
by such Stockholder Representative or member of the Committee hereunder; (ii)
any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith upon advice of such  

---|---|--- 
 



7 given with respect to any questions relating to the duties and
responsibilities hereunder; or (iii) any action taken or omitted to be taken
in reliance upon any communication or document, including any written notice
or instructions provided to such Stockholder Representative or Committee
member, not only as to due execution, validity and effectiveness of
its provisions, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information
contained therein, which in good faith are believed to be genuine and to have
been signed or presented by the proper person. 
---|--- 
 



     | 2.1.3 | The Stockholder Representative shall not be obligated to
make any inquiry, investigation or determination as to the truth and accuracy
of any information contained therein, nor shall it, in such capacity, be
deemed to have made any representation or warranty of any kind to any person. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2.1.4 | The Stockholder Representative shall not incur any
Liability to any Company Holder by virtue of the failure or refusal of the
Stockholder Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of its duties hereunder,
except for actions or omissions constituting actions or omissions constituting
fraud, willful misrepresentation with the intent to deceive or willful breach
of a covenant in the Merger Agreement or this Agreement. A Stockholder
Representative shall have no Liability in respect of any Proceeding brought
against such Stockholder Representative by any Company Holder, regardless of
the legal theory under which such Liability may be sought to be imposed,
whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or
otherwise, if such Stockholder Representative took or omitted taking any
action in good faith.  
---|---|--- 

Section 3.1 _Stockholder Representative Expense Fund._

 



     | 3.1.1 |

Each Company Holder hereby authorizes the Stockholder Representative to
receive at the closing of the Merger the Stockholder Representative
Expense Fund Amount, for deposit into the Stockholder Representative Expense
Fund. The Stockholder Representative Expense Fund shall be utilized by the
Stockholder Representative to pay any and all expenses (including legal,
accounting, consulting, expert and other professional fees) incurred by the
Stockholder Representative, in its capacity as such and in connection with any
pre-Closing or post-Closing matters after the consummation of transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, together with any and all judgments,
settlements and other Losses arising out of Scheduled Indemnity Matters and
other Special Indemnity Claims (collectively, "Losses and Expenses"). The
Company Holders shall not receive interest or other earnings on the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund and the Company Holders irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that
they may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in the
Stockholder  

---|---|--- 
 



8 that the Stockholder Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice. The Stockholder Representative shall
have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. For tax purposes, the Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund shall be treated as having been received and
voluntarily set aside by the Company Holders at the time of Closing. Each
Company Holder agrees to be responsible for his, her, or its allocable portion
of such Losses and Expenses, provided that the Stockholder Representative
will look to reimbursement first from the Stockholder Representative Expense
Fund prior to seeking reimbursement directly from any Company Holder. In the
event that there are no pending Losses and Expenses, indemnification claims
or outstanding Scheduled Indemnity Matters or other Special Indemnity Claims
on the eighteenth (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, or such later
date as may be determined by the Stockholder Representative in its reasonable
judgment (the "Termination Date"), the Stockholder Representative Expense
Fund, less any amounts that have been disbursed to pay for Losses and
Expenses, shall be distributed by the Stockholder Representative to the Agent
for further distribution to the Company Holders in the proportion specified
in the Merger Agreement. In the event that there are pending Losses and
Expenses, indemnification claims or outstanding Scheduled Indemnity Matters or
other Special Indemnity Claims on the Termination Date, the Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund shall be held until all such matters are finally
resolved. Upon the resolution of all such pending matters, the Stockholder
Representative shall promptly distribute the balance of the Stockholder
Representative Expense Fund to the Agent for further distribution to the
Company Holders in the proportion specified in the Merger Agreement. In
connection with the release of the Indemnity Escrow Fund by the Escrow
Agent to the Company Holders as contemplated by _Section 9.7_ of the Merger
Agreement, the Stockholder Representative is hereby authorized to direct the
Escrow Agent to withhold all or any portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Consideration and to remit such amount to the Stockholder Representative for
deposit into the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund if it, in its sole
discretion, determines that additional amounts are necessary to satisfy the
purposes of the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund and the
responsibilities of the Stockholder Representative hereunder. 
---|--- 



     | 3.1.2 | In consideration of the Stockholder Representatives
efforts hereunder, the Stockholder Representative and each Member shall be
compensated as set forth on  _Schedule A_ attached hereto for any and all
time spent on, or relating to, matters and activities contemplated by this
Agreement ("Compensation"). 
---|---|--- 
 



9 Representative and members of the Stockholder Representative Advisory Group
shall be paid from the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund. Such payments
shall be withdrawn from the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund on a
biweekly or monthly basis, at the discretion of the Stockholder
Representative. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 4.1 _Post-Closing Adjustments; Forfeiture of Contingent Payments_.
Each Company Holder agrees that:

 



     | 4.1.1 | The Stockholder Representative is hereby authorized to
direct Parent to withhold all or any portion of any Contingent Payment and to
remit such amount to the Stockholder Representative for deposit into the
Stockholder Representative Expense Fund (and the balance of any such
Contingent Payment shall be deposited ratably into the Payment Fund for
payment to the Company Holders as described in  _Section 2.11(a)_ of the
Merger Agreement) for payment of (i) any post-Closing expenses incurred to any
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors in connection
with the Merger Agreement and this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (ii) any expenses incurred by the
Stockholder Representative in its capacity as such pursuant to this Agreement
and in connection with the defense, compromise, arbitration and/or
settlement of any indemnification claims under the Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 4.1.2 | In the event that after the third anniversary of final
distribution of the Merger Consideration by Parent and all remaining amounts
in the Stockholder Representative Expense Fund, and after diligent efforts on
behalf of the Stockholder Representative, any Company Holder can not be
located or contacted, then the Stockholder Representative shall be authorized
and entitled to make a charitable contribution of such Company Holders
Allocable Share of the Merger Consideration not distributed to such Company
Holder. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 5.1 _General_.



     | 5.1.1 | Parent and its Affiliates are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 5.1.2 | The General Provisions set forth in _ARTICLE X_ of the
Merger Agreement, to the extent applicable, are hereby incorporated by
reference as if expressly set forth herein. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.1.3 | In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 5.1.4 |

or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered
by hand or sent by facsimile or electronic transmission
