_(e)_ ,  _Section 7.20_, _Section 10.10_ and _Section 11.9_ (as so

conditions of this Agreement, the Purchase Price shall be payable by wire
transfer of immediately available funds as follows:

  



        
   

  



  

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the
following (the " _Closing Cash Payment_ "): (i) the Base Amount, _minus_ (ii)
the Escrow Amount, (iii) _minus_  the Second Escrow Amount, (iv) _minus_

Aircraft Escrow Agent in accordance with the Detained Aircraft Escrow
Agreement; and

  



  

(e) Any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement shall be
paid as and when due in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

3.2 _Closing Net Cash Adjustment and Net Asset Value Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) _Estimated Closing Net Cash Amount_.  On or prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Purchaser a
written statement setting forth Sellers good faith estimate of the Closing
Net Cash Amount (the " _Estimated Closing Net Cash Amount_ "), which amount
shall be used for purposes of determining the Closing Cash Payment.

  



  

(b) _Estimated Net Asset Value Adjustment_.  At least three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
deliver to Purchaser (i) a good faith estimate of the unaudited combined
balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the Effective Closing Time,
which shall be prepared by Seller in accordance with the past policies and
practices of the Acquired Companies (without giving effect to the purchase
and sale of the Membership Units), and (ii) a written statement setting forth
Sellers good faith estimate of the Net Asset Value as of the Effective
Closing Time prepared in accordance with the sample calculation and
methodologies and principles set forth on _Exhibit 3.2(c)(iii)_ (the "
_Estimated Net Asset Value Amount_ ") and the resulting calculation of
the Estimated NAV Deficiency Amount (as defined below), if any, or the
Estimated NAV Surplus Amount (as defined below), if any (the " _Estimated Net
Asset Value Statement_ "). If the Estimated Net Asset Value Amount is less
than the Target Net Asset Value Amount by more than the Collar Amount, then
the amount of the Closing Cash Payment shall be decreased, dollar for dollar,
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(vi)_ by an amount (the " _Estimated NAV
Deficiency Amount_ ") equal to (x) the amount by which the Target Net Asset
Value Amount exceeds the Estimated Net Asset Value Amount _minus_ (y) the
Collar

  



        
   

  



  

Amount. If the Estimated Net Asset Value Amount is greater than the Target
Net Asset Value Amount by more than the Collar Amount, then the amount of the
Closing Cash Payment shall be increased, dollar for dollar, pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)(vi)_ by an amount (the " _Estimated NAV Surplus Amount_ ")
equal to (x) the amount by which the Estimated Net Asset Value Amount exceeds
the Target Net Asset Value Amount _minus_ (y) the Collar Amount. If the
Estimated Net Asset Value Amount does not differ from the Target Net Asset
Value Amount by more than the Collar Amount, then the Closing Cash Payment
shall not be adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(vi)_ as a result of
the Estimated Net Asset Value Amount.

  



  

(c) _Preparation of Closing Date Statements_.  As soon as practicable (but in
any event within 120 days) after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare,
or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller:

  



  

(i) a combined balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the Effective
Closing Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), which shall be prepared by
Purchaser in accordance with GAAP applied consistent with the past policies
and practices of the Acquired Companies (without giving effect to the
purchase and sale of the Membership Units);

Balance Sheet and audited by Sellers auditors (the " _Audited Statement of
Net Asset Value_ "), the expense of which audit will be borne one-half by
Seller and one-half by Purchaser;

  



  

(iii) a written statement setting forth Purchasers determination and
calculation of the Net Asset Value as of the Effective Closing Time prepared
in accordance with the sample calculation and methodology and principles set
forth on _Exhibit 3.2(c)(iii)_ (the " _Closing Net Asset Value_ "),
including the components thereof, and Purchasers determination of the
resulting calculation of the anticipated final adjustment amount in
accordance with _Section 3.2(e)_ (the " _Closing Net Asset Value Statement_
"), which shall include such information as is reasonably sufficient to
reflect how Purchaser made such determination and calculation; and

  



  

(iv) a written statement setting forth Purchasers determination and
calculation of the Closing Net Cash Amount, including the components thereof,
and Purchasers determination of the resulting calculation of the anticipated
final adjustment amount in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_ (the " _Closing
Net Cash Amount Statement_ ", together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Audited Statement of Net Asset Value and the Closing Net Asset Value
Statement, the " _Closing Date Statements_ "), which shall include such
information as is reasonably sufficient to reflect how Purchaser made such
determination and calculation.

  



  

(d) _Review of and Resolution of Disputes Relating to the Closing Date
Statements_. Seller shall complete its review of the Closing Date Statements
within 30 days after the date on which the Closing Date Statements are
delivered to it (the " _Review Period_ "). During the Review
Period, Purchaser shall make readily available to Seller and its Related
Persons all relevant books and records and any workpapers (including those of
its accountants) in its possession or under its control relating to the
Closing Date Statements and all other items reasonably requested by Seller or
its Related Persons for the purpose of such review.  In the event that
Seller determines that any item reflected on the Closing Date Statements has
not been determined on the basis set forth in this Agreement, or has been
included in violation of this

  



        
   

  



  

Agreement, Seller shall so inform Purchaser in writing (the " _Objection_ ")
on or before 11:59 p.m. on the last day of the Review Period, setting forth a
specific description of the basis or bases of the Objection and the
adjustments to the Closing Balance Sheet, Audited Statement of Net Asset
Value, Closing Net Asset Value Statement and/or Closing Net Cash Amount
Statement that Seller believes should be made. Purchaser shall have 30 days
after the delivery of the Objection to review and respond to the Objection,
and the Parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement with
respect to any matters in dispute. If the Parties are unable to resolve all
of their differences within 30 days after the expiration of the 30-day period
following delivery to Purchaser of such Objection and if the Closing Balance
Sheet, Audited Statement of Net Asset Value, Closing Net Asset Value
Statement and/or the Closing Net Cash Amount, as applicable, is not deemed to
be final as provided herein, either Party may refer their
remaining differences to the Chicago, Illinois office of Deloitte and Touche
LLP or another firm as agreed upon by the Parties (unless, at such time or at
any other time within the past 12 months prior to such referral, Deloitte
and Touche LLP or another firm as agreed upon by the Parties shall have
performed work for any of the Parties or their respective Affiliates, in
which case another independent accounting firm shall be selected by the
Parties) (the " _Independent Accountant_ "). The Independent Accountant
shall determine within 30 days after it has accepted such referral, on the
basis of the standards set forth in this Agreement, and only with respect to
the remaining differences so submitted, whether and to what extent, if any,
the items reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet, Audited Statement of Net
Asset Value, Closing Net Asset Value Statement and/or Closing Net Cash Amount
Statement require adjustment.  During such 30 day period, neither Party, nor
any Partys Related Persons, shall meet with, make presentations to or
otherwise contact the Independent Accountant regarding the Closing Date
Statements, unless the Party wishing to initiate such contact with the
Independent Accountant has first provided the other Party with not less than
three (3) Business Days prior written notice of such proposed contact and an
opportunity to be present for or otherwise participate in, as applicable,
such contact. The Independent Accountants determination shall be conclusive
and binding upon the Parties and shall be set forth in a written
determination of the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall
determine the allocation of the cost and expenses of its review and report to
be paid by Seller and Purchaser based on the inverse of the percentage its
determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of the total
items in dispute as originally submitted to it; _provided_ , _however_ ,
the percentage shall not exceed 100%. For purposes of illustration only, if
there were an aggregate of $100 of items in dispute and if the final written
determination of the Independent Accountant states that $80 of such items are
in accordance with Sellers position and $20 of such items are in accordance
with Purchasers position, Seller would bear 20% of the Independent
Accountants costs and expenses, on the one hand, and Purchaser would bear
80% of such costs and expenses, on the other hand. The Parties shall make
readily available to the Independent Accountant all relevant books and
records and any workpapers (including those of their respective accountants)
in their respective possession or under their respective control relating to
the Closing Date Statements and all other items reasonably requested by the
Independent Accountant. As used herein:

mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller, or (D) the Closing Net Cash Amount

Value Amount exceeds the Final Net Asset Value Amount _minus_ (y) the Collar
Amount. In such a case, Seller shall pay to Purchaser in immediately
available funds the Final NAV Deficiency Amount, (A) _minus_  any Estimated
NAV Deficiency Amount previously subtracted, or _plus_ any Estimated NAV
Surplus Amount previously added, pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)(vi)_

Amount.

available funds the Final NAV Surplus Amount, (A) _minus_ any Estimated NAV

  



        
   

  



  

Surplus Amount previously added, or _plus_ any Estimated NAV Deficiency

shall refund to Purchaser the difference between the Estimated NAV Surplus
Amount and the Final NAV Surplus Amount.

Closing Net Cash Amount.

3.3 _Allocation of Consideration._  Within 30 days after the determination of
the Final Net Asset Value Amount, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to
Seller a schedule allocating the Purchase Price among (a) the assets owned by

The Parties agree that for purposes of the Allocation Schedule, the value

Certificate pursuant to FAR Part 135 and a valid and current Operating
Certificate pursuant to FAR Part 133. STI holds a valid and current Air
Agency Certificate pursuant to FAR Part 145.  Air Quest holds a valid and
current Air Operator Certificate pursuant to FAR Part 125.

  



  

(g) Each Acquired Company is in compliance in all material respects with all
Laws applicable to Aircraft to which it is subject. No Acquired Company
has received written notice since January 1, 2006 that alleges that
such Acquired Company is not in compliance with any Law applicable to
Aircraft to which it is subject, including any voluntary disclosures,
enforcement notices, letters of investigation and notices of violations or
proposed penalties that have not been corrected, remedied or otherwise
resolved.

  



  

5.24 _Customers and Suppliers_. Section 5.24 of the Seller Disclosure Letter
sets forth a correct and complete list of the Acquired Companies top 10
customers and top 10 suppliers (measured by revenue of the Acquired Companies
derived from customers, or total cost paid by the Acquired Companies to
suppliers, for the 12 month period ended October 31, 2009,

  



        
   

  



  

excluding revenues derived from and costs paid with respect to the Excluded
Assets). To the Knowledge of Seller, the relationships of the Acquired
Companies with such top 10 customers and top 10 suppliers are good commercial
working relationships.  Neither Seller nor any of the Acquired Companies have
received written notice to the effect that any such customer or supplier
intends to (a) cease or materially decrease purchasing from, contracting with
or selling to an Acquired Company, as such customer or supplier has purchased
from, contracted with or sold to such Acquired Company in the past (b)
materially adversely modify its relationship with any Acquired Company or (c)
materially alter any purchases from, contracts with or sales to any Acquired
Company in the event of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder. To the Knowledge of Seller, no such customer or supplier intends
to cancel or otherwise substantially modify its relationship with the
Acquired Companies or to materially decrease or limit its services or supply
of materials to the Acquired Companies, or its usage or purchase of the
services of any Acquired Company.

  



  

5.25 _Gifts and Benefits_.  No employee or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
Independent Contractor or agent of Seller or the Acquired Companies acting on
such partys behalf has, directly or indirectly, given or agreed to give to
any customer, supplier, governmental employee or any actual or purported
agent of any of the foregoing who is or may be in a position to help or
hinder the business of the Acquired Companies (or assist such party in
connection with any actual or proposed transaction relating to the business
of the Acquired Companies) any unlawful gift or similar unlawful benefit
that, if not continued or repeated in the future, would have a material
adverse effect on the relationship of any Acquired Company with such Person.

  



  

5.26 _Brokers_. Neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser has or shall
have any liability or otherwise suffer or incur any Loss as a result of or in
connection with any brokerage or finders fee or other commission of any
Person retained by Seller in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

any of such Purchasers or AARs assets is subject, except, in the cases of
_clauses (b)_ and _(c)_ , for any violation, conflict, breach or default
that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the ability of Purchaser or AAR to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which Purchaser is or will
be a party.

  



  

6.4 _Consents and Approvals_.  Set forth in Section 6.4 of the Purchaser

Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which Purchaser is or will become a
party or the performance by Purchaser or AAR of its obligations hereunder or
thereunder (other than any such Consent the failure of which to obtain or
make, as the case may be, would not reasonably be expected to have a material

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to
which Purchaser is or will be a party).

  



  

6.5 _Litigation_. There are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of
Purchaser or AAR, threatened against Purchaser, AAR or any of their
Affiliates that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Purchaser or AAR to consummate the transactions

Purchaser is or will be a party.

  



        
   

  



  

6.6 _Adequacy of Funds_.  Purchaser has internal resources or financing
commitments from responsible financial institutions available in connection
with the acquisition of the Membership Units that are in the aggregate
sufficient to fund the Purchase Price in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement.

  



  

6.7 _Brokers_. Neither Seller nor any Affiliate of any Seller has or shall
have any liability or otherwise suffer or incur any Loss as a result of or in
connection with any brokerage or finders fee or other commission of any
Person retained by Purchaser in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6.8 _Investment Intent_.  Purchaser is acquiring the Membership Units for
Purchasers own account for investment and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof other than in compliance with the
Securities Act. Purchaser shall not offer for sale, sell or otherwise
transfer any of the Membership Units, except in compliance with
the Securities Act. Purchaser further acknowledges that the Membership Units
have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered for
sale, sold or otherwise transferred unless such offer, sale or other transfer
(a) is pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act or (b) is exempt from the provisions of section 5 of the Securities Act.

  



  

6.9 _Purchaser s Acknowledgement_.  Purchaser and AAR acknowledge that,
except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article
5_ and in the Ancillary Agreements, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
or their respective Related Persons has made, in connection with Purchasers
investigation of the business of the Acquired Companies or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise, any

or Related Parties or any errors or inaccuracies contained therein or
omissions therefrom, except for any liability resulting from the breach of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements expressly set forth
in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

7.1 _Conduct of Business_.

  



  

(a) Unless otherwise mutually agreed by Seller and Purchaser and except as
set forth on _Exhibit 7.1(a)_ or as contemplated or permitted by the terms

and after the Execution Date until the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates
shall cause the business of each Acquired Company to be conducted in the
ordinary course in all material respects and shall use commercially

 Without limiting the

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 7.1(a)_
or otherwise herein, nothing shall prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from at
any time and from time to time (i) sweeping cash from the accounts of the
Acquired Companies, including making any distributions or dividends in
furtherance thereof, and retaining such cash for Sellers own account or the
account of any of its Affiliates, or (ii) paying, pre-paying or otherwise
settling, or causing the Acquired Companies to pay, pre-pay or otherwise

the one hand, and an Acquired Company, on the other, including any payment or
pre-payment of any intercompany amounts related to the PRT Contract, up until
the completion of the Closing.

  



  

7.2 _Notification of Certain Matters_.  From and after the Execution Date
until the Closing, to the extent permitted by Law, Seller shall promptly
notify Purchaser in writing:

  



  

(a) if it becomes aware of the occurrence of any event or the existence of
any fact or condition that renders any of the representations and warranties
in _Article 5_ inaccurate or untrue;

  



  

(b) if it receives any written notice or other written communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

  



  

(c) if it receives any written notice or other written communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

7.3 _No Intentional Acts_.  None of Seller, Purchaser or AAR shall willfully
perform any act which, if performed, or willfully omit to perform any act
which, if omitted to be performed, would reasonably be expected to prevent or
excuse the performance of this Agreement by any Party or which would
reasonably be expected to result in any representation or warranty of a Party
herein being untrue in any material respect as of the Closing Date, it being
understood that no Party shall be required to waive any condition precedent
to Closing.

  



  

7.4 _Cooperation; Consents and Approvals_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Execution Date until the Closing, the Parties shall
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or proper, consistent with
applicable Law, to cause the Closing to occur (it being understood that no
Party shall be required to waive any condition precedent to Closing),
including taking all reasonable actions necessary to (i) comply promptly with
all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its Affiliates
with respect to the Closing and (ii) obtain all Consents of Governmental
Authorities, any prime contractor, subcontractor or other Person, in each
case required to be obtained or made in connection with this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (including those in connection with any Government Contract, any
other Required Governmental Approvals and the modification by the DOS of the
policy of denial it applied to Seller to exempt the Acquired Companies).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller shall
(x) respond promptly to inquiries from the applicable Governmental
Authorities in connection with such filings, including providing any
supplemental information that may be requested and (y) provide to each other
copies of all filings made with such Governmental Authorities at or prior to
the time they are filed, to the extent permitted by Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent any Governmental Authority requires the Parties to
execute any instrument in connection with obtaining such Governmental
Authoritys Consent with respect to a Government Contract, no such instrument
shall alter the provisions of this Agreement concerning the allocation of
liabilities between the Parties.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) In furtherance and not limitation of the provisions of _Section 7.4(a)_,
each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its reasonable
efforts (at its own expense) to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, all
Consents from third parties in respect of any Contract (other than any
Government Contract) to the extent such Contract requires such Consent as a
result of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties
shall not be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any
obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any such Consent may be required
(other than nominal filing or application fees). To the extent that any
Consent with respect to a Contract described in _Exhibit 8.2(e)_ is not
obtained before Closing, at Purchasers request Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) provide the applicable Acquired Company with the
economic benefits of any such Contract until its termination date, (ii)
cooperate in any lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to the
applicable Acquired Company and (iii) enforce, for the account of the
applicable Acquired Company and at Purchasers expense, any rights of Seller
arising from any such Contract against any third party, including the right
to elect to terminate in accordance with the terms of the Contract. Once a
Consent for any such Contract is obtained, Seller shall promptly assign or
take such other commercially reasonable action as may be necessary to confirm
the rights of the Acquired Companies in such Contract in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges that to the extent that any
Consent with respect to a Contract described in _Exhibit 8.2(e)_ has not
been obtained and the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall be deemed to
have waived any alleged breach arising as a result of the failure to obtain
any such Consent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or because of the termination of any Contract as a result thereof
so long as Seller has carried out its obligations under this _Section
7.4(b)_.

  



  

(c) To the extent that any Consent required to assign or otherwise transfer
the Excluded Assets to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller in connection with
the Reorganization is not obtained before Closing, at Sellers request
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) provide Seller or an Affiliate of Seller with the
economic benefits of any such Excluded Asset until its termination date, if
any, (ii) cooperate in any lawful arrangement designed to provide such
benefits to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller and (iii) enforce, exercise or
perform, for the account of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller and at Sellers
expense, any rights, remedies or obligations of the Acquired Companies
arising from or with respect to any such Excluded Asset, including the right
to elect to terminate in accordance with the terms of any Contract that is an
Excluded Asset and the obligation to mitigate any damages under any Contract
that is an Excluded Asset, and take such other lawful actions with respect to
such Excluded Asset as Seller may direct Purchaser to take from time to time,
including with respect to the operation, maintenance and repair of such
Excluded Asset. Seller and Purchaser agree that Seller shall be treated as
the owner of the Excluded Assets described in the preceding sentence for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, and no Party shall take any position
inconsistent with such treatment.  Any expenses actually incurred by
Purchaser or the Acquired Companies in providing cooperation with respect to
such an Excluded Asset shall be reimbursed by Seller. Once a Consent for the
assignment or other transfer of an Excluded Asset retained by the
Acquired Companies at Closing is obtained, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired
Companies to promptly assign or otherwise transfer such Excluded Asset to
Seller or an Affiliate of Seller for nominal consideration, and Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller shall assume or otherwise take assignment of such
Excluded Asset in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Purchaser
acknowledges that to the extent that any Consent required to assign

  



        
   

  



  

or otherwise transfer the Excluded Assets to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
in connection with the Reorganization has not been obtained and the Closing
occurs, Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any alleged breach arising
as a result of the failure to obtain any such Consent in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so long as Seller has carried out
its obligations under this _Section 7.4(c)_.

  



  

(d) For a period of 180 days after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, use its reasonable efforts to cooperate and provide all
reasonably necessary assistance in connection with Purchasers preparing and
filing of any additional notices, amendments and other correspondence with
DDTC and any other Governmental Authorities in connection with the transfer
of licenses set forth in item 13 of Section 5.13 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, the General Correspondence Rulings set forth in item 14 of Section
5.13 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and the amendment of the Technical
Assistance Agreement TA 3231-07, including (i) providing contact information
of, and introductions to, Governmental Authorities, (ii) providing copies of
export compliance records of the Acquired Companies not otherwise available
to the Acquired Companies, and (iii) providing summaries of past dealings and
copies of past correspondence with Governmental Authorities; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that nothing herein will obligate Seller to take any actions that
would unreasonably interfere with the operation of the businesses of Seller
and its Affiliates, result in any waiver of attorney-client privilege
or violate any Laws or the terms of any Contract to which Seller or its
Affiliates is a party or to which any of their assets is subject.

  



  

7.5 _Access to Records and Properties_.  From and after the Execution Date
until the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to:
(a) permit Purchaser, at its expense, to conduct such investigation of the
condition (financial or otherwise), businesses, assets, properties or
operations of the Acquired Companies as Purchaser shall reasonably deem
appropriate. Seller shall (i) upon reasonable notice from Purchaser, provide
Purchaser and its Related Persons reasonable access during normal business
hours to all the facilities, offices, personnel, books and records of the
Acquired Companies and (ii) furnish, or cause the Acquired Companies to
furnish, Purchaser with such financial and operating data and other
information with respect to the condition (financial or
otherwise), businesses, assets, properties or operations of the Acquired
Companies that is reasonably available to Seller or the Acquired Companies
and that Purchaser shall reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein will obligate the Acquired Companies or Seller to take any
actions that would unreasonably interfere with the operation of the
businesses of Seller and its Affiliates, result in any waiver of attorney-
client privilege or violate any Laws or the terms of any Contract to which
any of them is a party or to which any of their assets is subject.

  



  

7.6 _Reorganization_.  Seller shall cause the Reorganization to be carried
out in the manner specified in _Exhibit 1.1D_.

  



  

7.7 _Preservation of Books and Records; Access and Assistance_.

  



  

(a) For a period of seven years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Acquired Companies to, preserve and retain all corporate,
accounting, legal, auditing and other books and records (including any
documents relating to any governmental or non-governmental claims or Actions
with respect to any Acquired Company) relating to each

  



        
   

  



  

Acquired Companys business on or prior to the Closing Date.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, during such seven-year period, Purchaser may
dispose of any such books and records that are offered in writing to, but not
accepted by, Seller within 45 days after being so offered. If at any time
after such seven-year period Purchaser intends to dispose of any such books
and records, Purchaser shall not do so without first offering in writing such
books and records to Seller.

  



  

(b) After the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, permit Seller and its Related Persons to have reasonable access
to, and to inspect and copy, all materials referred to in _Section 7.7(a)_
and to meet with officers and employees of Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies on a mutually convenient basis in order to obtain explanations with
respect to such materials and to obtain additional information.

  



  

(c) In the event and for so long as any Party actively is contesting or
defending against any third-party Action, claim or demand in connection with
(i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact,
situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on, prior
to or after the Closing Date involving an Acquired Company, each Party shall
cooperate in the contest or defense, make available its personnel, and
provide such testimony and access to its books and records as shall be
necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and
expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or
defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article 11_).
For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 7.7(c)_ shall not apply to
disputes or litigation among the Parties and their respective Related
Persons.

  



  

7.8 _Insurance_. Purchaser acknowledges that, except as provided herein, the
coverage provided under the Insurance Policies for the Acquired Companies and
their respective businesses, assets, employees, officers and directors
(collectively, the " _Acquired Company Insureds_ ") will be terminated
effective as of the Effective Closing Time for the period after the Effective
Closing Time, and upon such termination, the Acquired Company Insureds will
cease to be covered under such policies with respect to the period after the
Effective Closing Time and will have to obtain replacement coverage for such
period. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

  



  

(a) Seller, upon the request of Purchaser, shall cooperate with and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents from the relevant
insurers as may be necessary for the continuation after the Effective Closing
Time in accordance with their respective terms of those Insurance Policies
set forth on _Exhibit 7.8(a)_ as to which an Acquired Company is the sole
named insured (the " _Acquired Company Insurance Policies_ ").

  



  

(b) Seller, upon the request of Purchaser, shall cooperate with and use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies in transitioning to their own separate insurance programs to
replace the coverage currently provided to the Acquired Company Insureds
under those insurance policies set forth on _Exhibit 7.8(b)_ (the " _Seller
Insurance Policies_ "), and shall provide Purchaser with information that is
in the possession of Seller or any of its Affiliates and is necessary and, to
the extent reasonably available, useful to obtain such replacement coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require Seller to disclose
any such information to Purchaser if such disclosure would jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or contravene any applicable Law.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) From and after the Effective Closing Time, Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies) shall retain and have the sole
responsibility for making any premium or other payments due under the Seller
Insurance Policies, and the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) shall have no responsibility therefor.

  



  

(d) From and after the Effective Closing Time, Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies shall have the sole responsibility for making any premium or other
payments due under the Acquired Company Insurance Policies, and Seller and
its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) shall have no
responsibility therefor. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that premium payments for the Acquired
Company Insurance Policies are payable on a periodic basis in advance, and,
to the extent any of the Acquired Company Insurance Policies are
continued after the Effective Closing Time, Purchaser agrees to reimburse
Seller for any premium or other payments (or any portion of such payments)
attributable to periods from and after the Effective Closing Time in
accordance with _Exhibit 3.2(c)(iii)_.

  



  

(e) Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of their respective

the foregoing:

  



  

(i) Seller shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, upon request,
assert, or assist the Acquired Company Insureds in asserting, claims (other

(ii) Purchaser shall promptly report to Seller any third-party claims of

thereof.

  



  

(iii) Seller (or, in the event that the primary economic burden is to be
borne by Purchaser and its Affiliates, Purchaser) has the right to control
the investigation, defense and settlement of such insurance claims, but no
such settlement may be effected without the consent of Purchaser (or Seller),
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless such
settlement does not include any admission of liability or exposure to third
party claims and includes as an unconditional term thereof the delivery of a
written release of the Acquired Companies (or Seller) and any other named
insured Affiliate of Purchaser (or Affiliate of Seller) from all liability in
respect of such insurance claims.  For purposes of this _Section 7.8_, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the primary economic burden of the
Retained Actions is being borne by Seller.

arrangement, whether now existing or which may arise in the future, under
which a portion of the services involve those that Seller and its Affiliates
would be restricted from performing pursuant to _Section 7.9(a)_, provided
that the portion of the services under such Contract or arrangement which
Seller or its Affiliates are restricted from performing pursuant to _Section

Seller or its applicable Affiliate uses its reasonable best efforts to
dispose of such Competitive Business to an unrelated Person as soon as
possible, and in any event within twelve months after the date of

Business).

  



  

(c) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and terminating two years
following the Closing Date, Seller agrees not to, and to cause its Affiliates

solicit or recruit for employment, employ or engage as a consultant any

(d) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and terminating two years
following the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees not to, and to cause its

Seller prior to such acquisition) or (ii) in any way limit any activities of
Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement.

  



  

(g) Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive covenants
contained in this _Section 7.9_ are commercially reasonable and reasonably
necessary to protect the Acquired Companies.

  



     

      
 

  



  

7.10 _Confidential Information_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective
upon the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

  



  

(b) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and terminating five years
following the Closing Date, Seller hereby agrees with Purchaser that Seller
shall not, and Seller shall cause its Affiliates and Related Persons not to,
directly or indirectly, disclose or make available to any Person other than
an Acquired Company or an Affiliate or Related Person of Seller any
confidential information specific to any Acquired Company acquired prior to
the Closing Date (including confidential information relating to the
customers and suppliers of the Acquired Companies). Nothing in this Agreement,
however, shall prohibit Seller and its Affiliates and Related Persons from
using or disclosing confidential information: (i) which is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of a
confidentiality obligation of Seller or its Affiliates, (ii) that has been
acquired through years of experience in the business of an Acquired Company
generally and that is not specific to any Acquired Company, (iii) with the
prior written consent of Purchaser, (iv) required by Seller or its Affiliates
to perform, comply with or enforce the terms of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement or conduct its business as currently conducted, (v) in
connection with any Action or governmental inquiry involving Seller or its
Affiliates or Related Persons, or (vi) to the extent required by Law or
request of a Governmental Authority, so long as, in the case of _clauses (v)_
and _(vi)_ only, reasonable prior notice is given to Purchaser of such
disclosure to the extent practicable or lawful and a reasonable opportunity
is afforded to Purchaser to contest the same.

  



  

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that, prior to and subsequent to the Closing, it
may be furnished with, receive or otherwise have access to confidential
information of Seller or its Affiliates not specific to the business of the
Acquired Companies (any such information, the " _Seller Confidential
Information_ ").  Subsequent to the Closing, Purchaser shall not disclose,
and shall maintain the confidentiality of, all Seller Confidential
Information. Purchaser shall use at least the same degree of care to
safeguard and to prevent the disclosure, publication,
dissemination, destruction, loss or alteration of the Seller Confidential
Information as it employs to avoid unauthorized disclosure, publication,
dissemination, destruction, loss or alteration of its own information (or
information of its customers) of a similar nature, but in no case less than
reasonable care. Purchaser shall not (i) use any Seller Confidential
Information in any manner, (ii) make any copies of any Seller Confidential
Information, (iii) acquire any right in or assert any Lien against any Seller
Confidential Information, (iv) sell, assign, transfer, lease, license or
otherwise dispose of any Seller Confidential Information to third parties or

of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by Seller) to promptly provide
any tangible embodiments of the Seller Confidential Information (including
copies thereof) to Seller if requested to do so, in the form reasonably
requested. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as
obligating Seller or any of its Affiliates to disclose any Seller
Confidential Information to Purchaser or as granting to or conferring on
Purchaser, expressly or impliedly, any right, title, interest or license to
any Seller Confidential Information or any components thereof.

  



        
   

  



  

7.11 _Injunctive Relief_.  The Parties recognize that any breach of _Section
7.9_ or _Section 7.10_ may cause irreparable injury to the other Parties and
that actual damages may be difficult to ascertain, and in any event, may be
inadequate. Accordingly (and without limiting the availability of legal or
equitable, including injunctive, remedies under any other provisions of this
Agreement), the Parties agree that in the event of any such breach, the other
Parties shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to such other
legal and equitable remedies that may be available. The Parties recognize that
the territorial, time and scope limitations in _Section 7.9_ or _Section
7.10_ are reasonable and properly required for the protection of the other
Parties and in the event that any such limitation is deemed to be
unreasonable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Parties agree and
submit to the imposition of such a limitation as said court shall deem
reasonable.

  



  

7.12 _Release_. Effective at the time of the Closing, Seller hereby, without
any further action, releases and forever discharges, and shall cause each of
its Affiliates, to release and forever discharge, each of the Acquired
Companies from any and all liabilities, claims, obligations, actions, causes
of action, suits at law or in equity of whatever kind or nature, debts, dues,
sums of money, accounts, reckonings, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants,
commitments, controversies, promises, variances, trespasses, judgments,
verdicts, extents, executions, Liens, payments, damages, costs, attorneys
fees, expenses and demands of any kind or nature, which Seller may have or
may have had, known or unknown, prior to the Closing, against the Acquired
Companies (as of immediately prior to the Closing); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing herein shall be deemed a release, discharge or limitation of (a)
any liability or obligation of the Acquired Companies or their respective
Related Persons under this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any other
agreement, certificate or other instrument executed and delivered in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, (b) any rights and benefits of Seller and its Affiliates under this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any other agreement, certificate or
other instrument executed and delivered in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (c) any liability or
obligation under the Promissory Note or (d) any matter set forth in _Exhibit
7.12(d)_.

  



  

7.13 _Use of Xe Name and Blackwater Name_.  Purchaser acknowledges that the
Xe Name and the Blackwater Name are and shall remain the property of Seller
or its Affiliates and that nothing in this Agreement shall transfer or shall
operate as an agreement to transfer any right, title or interest in the Xe
Name or the Blackwater Name to Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser
(including the Acquired Companies). Seller is not granting Purchaser a license
to use, and none of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) shall have any title, right or interest in or to, the Xe
Name or the Blackwater Name after the Closing.

  



  

7.14 _Employment_. As of the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) to, continue the employment of
each employee who was employed by an Acquired Company immediately prior to
the Closing (" _Continuing Employees_ ") on terms and conditions with respect
to salary and wages that are no less favorable than the terms and conditions
applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing and,
for the period commencing at the Effective Closing Time and ending on the
first anniversary thereof, not to reduce the salary and wages of the
Continuing Employees, except to the extent that Purchaser reasonably
determines that a salary or wage reduction is appropriate for business
reasons relating to the financial performance of the Acquired Companies. For
the period

  



        
   

  



  

commencing at the Effective Closing Time and ending on the first anniversary
thereof, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) to, provide to Continuing Employees employee benefit
plans, programs, policies and arrangements that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to the plans, programs, policies and arrangements applicable
to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates.
No provision of this Agreement shall be construed as limiting the ability
of Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies), as
applicable, to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any
time following the Effective Closing Time for any reason.  Continuing
Employees terminated during the period commencing at the Effective Closing
Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof will be provided with
severance benefits to which they are entitled pursuant to Purchasers
severance plan or policy.  Seller shall cause the Acquired Companies to pay,
on or prior to the Closing Date, all bonuses that have become due and payable
to the employees and Independent Contractors of the Acquired Companies prior
to or at the Effective Closing Time.

  



  

7.15 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) As of the Effective Closing Time, Continuing Employees shall cease
participating in all Employee Benefit Plans. Immediately after the
Effective Closing Time, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
cause those employee benefit plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate as of the Effective Closing
Time pursuant to _Section 7.14_ (the " _Purchaser Plans_ ") to credit each
Continuing Employee for his or her service with any Acquired Company and
predecessor employer to the extent credited under corresponding Employee
Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Closing Time, as service
with Purchaser and its Affiliates under the corresponding Purchaser Plans for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting in benefits under
such plan and vacation and sick leave accrual, but not for determining the
amounts of benefits (other than vacation and sick leave accruals) or for any
other purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Continuing
Employees be entitled to any credit to the extent that it would result in
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. As of
the Effective Closing Time, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and, to
the extent applicable, subject to the consent of insurers and other
applicable third parties, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) to, (i) cause any and all pre-existing
condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods, active employment
requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under the
Purchaser Plans to be waived or satisfied with respect to any Continuing
Employee (and his or her covered dependents), to the extent that such
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods were waived or satisfied for such
Continuing Employee (and his or her covered dependents) under the
corresponding Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Closing Time, and (ii) give credit for or otherwise take into account under
the Purchaser Plans the out-of-pocket expenses and annual expense limitation
amounts paid by each Continuing Employee under the corresponding Employee
Benefit Plan for the year in which the Closing Date occurs.

  



  

(b) Purchaser shall not, at any time during the 90 days following the Closing
Date, engage in any conduct that would result in an "employment loss" or
layoff for a number of Continuing Employees that, if aggregated with any
conduct on the part of Seller prior to the Closing Date, would trigger the
WARN Act. Purchaser agrees that, from and after the Effective

  



        
   

  



  

Closing Time, Purchaser shall be responsible for any notification required
under and any liability arising under or relating to the WARN Act with
respect to the Continuing Employees or action taken in violation of this
paragraph.

  



  

(c) With respect to any Purchaser Plan that is a defined contribution plan
(as defined in section 3(34) of ERISA) in which the Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate, Purchaser shall take all actions necessary to allow
the Continuing Employees to make eligible rollover contributions to such
Purchaser Plan of their account balances (in cash and in loan notes, if any,
evidencing loans to such Continuing Employees as of the date of distribution)
from the Employee Benefit Plans as soon as practicable following the Closing.

  



  

(d) Except as described in _Section 7.15(c)_, neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) shall assume any Employee
Benefit Plan (other than Employee Benefit Plans sponsored by the Acquired
Companies) or its related liabilities or assets, and Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) shall hold all such Employee
Benefit Plans and related liabilities and assets.

  



  

7.16 _Exclusive Dealings_.  During the period from the Execution Date through
the Closing or termination of this Agreement, without the prior written
approval of Purchaser, Seller shall not (a) sell, dispose of or otherwise
convey (including through any merger, consolidation, equity transfer or
otherwise) its right, title or interest in and to the Membership Units or
permit any of the Acquired Companies to sell, dispose of or otherwise convey
any of their assets, other than the sale of assets in the ordinary course of
business and other than the Excluded Assets, or (b) enter into, conduct or
continue any discussions or negotiations with any other party relating to the
sale of the Membership Units or the sale of the assets of the Acquired
Companies (including through any merger, consolidation, equity transfer or
otherwise), other than the sale of assets in the ordinary course of business
and other than the Excluded Assets.

  



  

7.17 _Director, Manager and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause each Acquired Company
to indemnify, exculpate and advance the expenses of the DandO Indemnified
Parties for acts or omissions of the DandO Indemnified Parties occurring on or
prior to the Closing Date to the extent required in the certificate of
formation, by-laws, limited liability company agreement or similar
organizational documents of each Acquired Company as of immediately prior to
the Closing regardless of any subsequent amendment or modification of such
organizational documents. " _D andO Indemnified Parties_" shall mean each
present and former director, manager and officer of each Acquired Company,
and each Person who served at the request of an Acquired Company as
a director, manager, officer, trustee, fiduciary or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or other enterprise (when acting in such capacity) determined as
of the Effective Closing Time.

  



  

(b) The provisions of this _Section 7.17_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties, their
heirs and their representatives. No release executed by a DandO
Indemnified Party in connection with his or her departure from an Acquired
Company (or other enterprise for which such Person serves as a director,
manager, officer, trustee, fiduciary or agent at the request of an Acquired
Company)

  



        
   

  



  

shall be deemed to be a release or waiver of any of the indemnity or other
rights provided such DandO Indemnified Party in this _Section 7.17_, unless
the release or waiver of the provisions of this _Section 7.17_ is expressly
provided in such release.

  



  

7.18 _Post-Closing Relationship Between the Parties_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall not permit its
Affiliates to, impose upon any Acquired Company any marketing, management or
other similar fee or charge, except as provided in the License Agreement or
as otherwise agreed to by the Parties.

  



  

(b) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and terminating 180 days
following the three-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Preferred
Supplier Period_ "), each Acquired Company shall be a Preferred Supplier to
Seller and its Affiliates for rendering services **** that Seller and
its Affiliates are restricted from performing pursuant to _Section
7.9_ that are to be provided under any prime Contract with any Governmental
Authority of the United States Federal government, any Governmental Authority
of Iraq or Afghanistan or any Non-Governmental Organization (a " _Preferred
Supplier Contract_ ") that Seller or its Affiliate plans to bid on ("
_Required Aviation Services_ "). Being a " _Preferred Supplier_ " shall mean
that:

  



  

(i) With respect to any Preferred Supplier Contract opportunity that Seller
or its Affiliate plans to bid on during the Preferred Supplier Period that
includes Required Aviation Services, the procedures shall be as follows:

  



  

(A) Seller or its appropriate Affiliate, prior to contacting any third party,
and subject to any reasonable non-disclosure terms between Seller and
Purchaser that Seller may require, shall determine whether an Acquired
Company has the interest and capability to perform the Required Aviation
Services;

  



  

(B) Upon determining that an Acquired Company has such interest and
capability, Seller or its appropriate Affiliate (as the prime contractor) and
the interested Acquired Company (as a team member or subcontractor to provide
the Required Aviation Services) shall conduct good faith negotiations as soon
as feasible with the objective of entering into a mutually acceptable teaming
agreement or subcontract meeting the requirements of the procurement and
applicable Law, price and other terms considered;

  



  

(C) If the negotiating parties reach an impasse, or if competition is
required by the prime Contract customer or applicable Law, Seller or its
appropriate Affiliate also may enter into negotiations with a third party or
parties having the interest and capability to perform the Required Aviation
Services, _provided_  that before executing a teaming agreement or
subcontract with any such third party, Seller or its appropriate Affiliate
shall offer the interested Acquired Company and each third party
the opportunity to submit a best and final offer, which offer from an
Acquired Company shall be accepted by Seller or its appropriate Affiliate if
it is

  



        
   

  



  

equal to or better than any third party offer, price and other terms of the
bid and the prime Contract considered.

  



  

(D) Any proposed teaming agreement or subcontract shall be subject to and
conditioned upon obtaining any approval required by the prime Contract
customer.

  



  

(ii) If any prime Contract customer disapproves any teaming agreement or
subcontract negotiated by Seller or its Affiliate with an Acquired Company
pursuant to _Section 7.18(b)(i)_ above, notwithstanding commercially
reasonable efforts by Seller or its appropriate Affiliate to obtain such
approval, each party shall be entitled to pursue the subject Preferred
Supplier Contract opportunity as it determines best.

  



  

7.19 _AAR Guaranty_.

  



  

(a) AAR hereby irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to
Seller the prompt and full payment, performance and discharge by Purchaser or
the Acquired Companies (after Closing) of all of Purchasers or the Acquired
Companies (after Closing), as applicable, covenants, agreements, obligations
and liabilities under this Agreement and all Ancillary Agreements or any
other agreement, certificate or other instrument executed and delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto as and when due (collectively, the " _Guaranteed
Obligations_ "), including the due, prompt and punctual payment of all
amounts which are or may become due and payable by Purchaser or the Acquired
Companies (after Closing) hereunder or thereunder when and as the same shall
become due and payable, in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof, as
applicable (the " _Guaranty_ "). AAR acknowledges and agrees that,
with respect to all Guaranteed Obligations, such guaranty constitutes a
guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection and shall not be
conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by Seller of any remedies which it
now has or may hereafter have against Purchaser or the Acquired Companies
(after Closing), as applicable, whether at law, in equity or otherwise. Upon
receipt of written notice requesting performance of the Guaranteed
Obligation, AAR shall forthwith perform or cause to be performed all
Guaranteed Obligations, and will forthwith make full payment of any amount
due with respect thereto, at its sole cost and expense, to the extent that
such payment has not previously been made by Purchaser. This _Section 7.19_
shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon and after the date
that the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been paid or performed in full.

  



  

(b) The obligations of AAR under the Guaranty shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, be absolute and unconditional irrespective
of:

  



  

(i) the illegality of any portion of the Guaranty;

  



  

(ii) the illegality, validity or genuineness of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements or any other agreement, certificate or other instrument
executed and delivered pursuant hereto or thereto with respect to Purchaser;

  



  

(iii) the enforceability of any portion of this _Section 7.19_ against AAR
or Purchaser;

  



        
   

  



  

(iv) to the extent there is no change to this _Section 7.19_, any release
or discharge of any obligation of Purchaser or the Acquired Companies
(after Closing) under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any
other agreement, certificate or other instrument executed and delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto resulting from any change in the corporate
existence, structure or ownership of Purchaser or the Acquired Companies
(after Closing), or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other
similar proceeding affecting Purchaser, the Acquired Companies (after
Closing) or any of their respective assets;

  



  

(v) any amendment or modification of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or any other agreement, certificate or other instrument executed
and delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, or change in the manner, place or
terms of payment or performance, or any change or extension of the time of
payment or performance of, renewal or alteration of, any Guaranteed
Obligation, any escrow arrangement or other security therefor, any Loss
incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, or any amendment or
waiver of or any consent to any departure from the terms of this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements;

  



  

(vi) the existence of any claim, setoff or other right that AAR may have at
any time against Purchaser, Seller or the Acquired Companies (after Closing),
whether in connection with any Guaranteed Obligation or otherwise (
_provided_ , _however_ , that AAR remains able to pursue such claims
independently); or

  



  

(vii) any other act or omission relating to the Guaranty (other than
performance or payment of the Guaranteed Obligations in full as required
hereunder) that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of
AAR or otherwise operate as a discharge of AAR as a matter of Law or equity.

  



  

(c) AAR hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law: (i) (A) all notices
to AAR (except as set forth in this _Section 7.19_) or to any other Person,
including notices of the acceptance of the Guaranty or the creation, renewal,
extension or modification of the Guaranteed Obligations, or of default in the
performance of the Guaranteed Obligations (or any portion thereof) and

other matters relating thereto and (B) diligence and demand of performance;
(ii) any statute of limitations affecting AARs liability hereunder or the
enforcement thereof; (iii) all principles or provisions of Law or equity
which conflict with the terms of the Guaranty; and (iv) all defenses based on

enforce this Guaranty upon the occurrence of a breach of this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements or any other agreement, certificate or other
instrument executed and delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, notwithstanding
the existence of any dispute between Purchaser and Seller with respect to the
existence of such default or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations (or
any portion thereof) or any counterclaim, set-off or other claim which
Purchaser, AAR or their respective Affiliates may allege against Seller with
respect thereto.  Moreover, AAR agrees that to the full extent allowed by
Law, its obligations under the Guaranty shall not be affected by any
circumstances which constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor
or surety.

  



  

(d) AAR shall require any successor, continuing entity or surviving entity to
AAR, whether by merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other business
combination, to expressly agree in writing with Seller to assume and perform

Guaranty to the extent that such successor or entity does not succeed to the
obligations of AAR hereunder by operation of Law.

  



  

(e) AAR may not exercise any rights of subrogation or contribution,
whether arising by contract or operation of Law (including any such right
arising under bankruptcy or insolvency Laws) or otherwise, by reason of any
payment by it in respect of the Guaranty unless and until all of the
Guaranteed Obligations have been paid or performed in full.

the Detained Aircraft Escrow Amount shall be deposited in escrow pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_, to be held and disbursed in the manner set forth in the

Closing Date, each time a Detained Aircraft is released from detention, funds
equal to the Detained Aircraft Price for such Detained Aircraft shall be
disbursed to Seller in accordance with the Detained Aircraft Escrow
Agreement. If, at the end of such 120-day period, any Detained Aircraft shall
not have been released from detention, then such unreleased Detained Aircraft
shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets, title to such unreleased Detained
Aircraft shall be promptly transferred to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller in
consideration of the disbursement of funds to Purchaser in accordance with
the Detained Aircraft Escrow Agreement, and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the aggregate Detained Aircraft Price of such transferred Detained
Aircraft.

_Section 7.4(c)_, until Presidential and EPA have received all Consents

contemplated by the Reorganization, Presidential shall continue to perform
the Super T Subcontract and maintain liability, casualty and property
insurance coverage with respect to the Super Tucano and the Super T
Subcontract in such amounts as are appropriate and reasonable taking into
account the value of the Super Tucano and the scope of the services to be
provided under the Super T Subcontract, but all revenues, benefits, expenses
and risks shall be for the account of Seller or one of its Affiliates, as
designated by Seller. Until such Consents have been received, Presidential
shall (a) be released from any obligation to make lease payments to EPA with
respect to the Super Tucano and (b) remit promptly (but in any event within
two Business Days after receipt) to Seller all amounts collected with respect
to the Super T Subcontract, minus only such amounts necessary to reimburse
Presidential for its actual expenses incurred in performing the Super T
Subcontract, which actual expenses shall be reasonable, substantiated and
documented from time to time upon the request of Seller. The Super Tucano and
the Super T Subcontract shall constitute Excluded Assets notwithstanding the
Acquired Companies continued ownership or control.

 **ARTICLE 10. 
 TAX MATTERS**

  

 ** **

  

10.1 _Indemnification for Taxes_.

  



  

(a) Except to the extent such Taxes are accrued and specifically identified
on the Closing Date Statements, from and after the Closing, Seller agrees to
indemnify Purchaser and the Acquired Companies against, and agrees to hold
Purchaser and the Acquired Companies harmless from, on an After-Tax Basis,
(i) any Taxes attributable to the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates
imposed on or incurred by the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates or by
Purchaser with respect to the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates and
attributable to any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
and the portion, determined as described in _Section 10.1(c)_, of any such
Taxes for any taxable period beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending
after the Closing Date which is allocable to the portion of such period
occurring prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ "); (ii)
Taxes relating to any breach of a warranty or misrepresentation under
_Section 5.20_ (without respect to any requirement contained in such
representations and warranties relating to materiality); and (iii) any Loss
or Taxes resulting from a breach of any of the covenants made by Seller in
_Sections 7.1(a)(xvii)_ and _7.1(a)(xviii)_ or _Sections 10.2_ through
10.10 inclusive. For the avoidance of doubt, the Taxes for which Seller is
indemnifying Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 10.1_ shall be determined
without giving effect to the purchase and sale of the Membership Units and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Purchaser shall be liable for, and agrees to indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates against, and agrees to hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless
from, on an After-Tax Basis, (i) any Taxes imposed on or incurred by the
Acquired Companies, Purchaser or Seller and attributable to any taxable
period beginning on or after the Closing Date, and the portion, determined as
described in _Section 10.1(c)_, of any such Taxes for any taxable period
beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date which
is allocable to the portion of such period occurring on or after the Closing
Date (the " _Post-Closing Period_ "); and (ii) any Loss or Taxes resulting
from a breach of any of the covenants made by Purchaser in _Sections 10.2_
through 10.10 (inclusive).

  



  

(c) Whenever it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to determine the
portion of any Taxes of or with respect to an Acquired Company or its owner
for a taxable period beginning prior to and ending after the Closing Date
which is allocable to the Pre-Closing Period or the Post-Closing Period, the
determination shall be made (i) in the case of property, ad valorem or
similar Taxes (which are not based on or measured by production), by
allocating all such Taxes on a per diem basis, (ii) in the case of franchise,
capital or similar Taxes (which are not based on or measured by income or
profit), by allocating all such Taxes on a per diem basis,

  



        
   

  



  

and (iii) in the case of other Taxes, by assuming that each of the Pre-
Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period constitutes a separate taxable
period and by taking into account the actual taxable events occurring during
each such period pursuant to a closing of the books of the Acquired Company
occurring as of the Closing Date.

  



  

10.2 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

  



  

(a) With respect to each Tax Return for, by or with respect to an Acquired
Company that is required to be filed on or before the Closing Date, Seller
shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared, shall cause to be included in
such Tax Return all items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit or
other items (collectively " _Tax Items_ ") required to be included therein
and shall timely file or cause to be filed (assuming it has authority to do
so) such Tax Return with the appropriate taxing authority and shall (subject
to any right of indemnification under _Section 10.1_) pay the amount of
Taxes shown to be due by such Acquired Company or by Seller on such Tax
Return. Except to the extent required by law, such Tax Returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the past practice of such Acquired
Company, and Seller will notify Purchaser in the event that any such Tax
Return is not filed on a basis that is consistent with prior Tax Returns.
Seller will provide such Tax Returns to Purchaser no later than 30 days prior
to their due date and permit Purchaser to review and comment on such Tax
Returns. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be required to provide
any income tax returns of any owner of an Acquired Company.

  



  

(b) With respect to each Tax Return for, by or with respect to an Acquired
Company that is required to be filed after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
cause such Tax Return to be prepared, shall cause to be included in such Tax
Return all Tax Items required to be included therein, and shall cause such
Acquired Company to file timely such Tax Return with the appropriate taxing
authority and shall (subject to any right of indemnification under _Section
10.1_) pay timely the amount of Taxes shown to be due by any Acquired Company
or by Purchaser on such Tax Return. Except as required by law, each return
(a " _Straddle Period Return_ ") that includes a period that begins prior to
the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date shall be filed on a basis
consistent with such Acquired Companys past practices. Purchaser will provide
such Straddle Period Returns to Seller no later than 30 days prior to their
due date and permit Seller to review and comment on such Tax Returns. Neither
Purchaser nor the Acquired Companies shall file any amended Tax Returns for
the Acquired Companies for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date unless required by applicable Law, and without the prior written consent
of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to each final "s-corporation"
income Tax Return for each AWS Subsidiary required to be filed, Seller shall
cause such Tax Return to be prepared, shall cause to be included in such Tax
Return all Tax Items required to be included, and shall cause such Tax Return
to be timely filed with the appropriate taxing authorities and shall (subject
to any right of indemnification under _Section 10.1_) pay timely the amount
of Taxes shown to be due by such AWS Subsidiary or by Seller on such Tax
Return.

  



        
   

  



  

10.3 _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) Seller shall, subject to applicable Law, grant to Purchaser (or its
designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the records relating to
the Acquired Companies within the possession or control of Seller or its
Affiliates (including work papers and correspondence with taxing
authorities), and shall afford Purchaser (or its designees) the right (at
Purchasers expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies
thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Purchaser (or its
designees) to prepare Tax Returns, to conduct negotiations with Tax
authorities, and to implement the provisions of, or to investigate or defend
any claims between the Parties arising under, this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Purchaser shall, subject to applicable Law, grant to Seller (or its
designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the records relating to
the Acquired Companies within the possession or control of Purchaser, its
Affiliates, or any Acquired Company (including work papers and correspondence
with taxing authorities), and shall afford Seller (or its designees) the
right (at Sellers expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies
thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Seller (or its
designees) to prepare Tax Returns, to conduct negotiations with
Tax authorities, and to implement the provisions of, or to investigate or
defend any claims between the Parties arising under, this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Each of the Parties will preserve and retain all schedules, work papers
and other documents relating to any Tax Returns of or with respect to the
Acquired Companies or to any claims, audits or other proceedings affecting
the Acquired Companies until the later of: (i) the expiration of the statute
of limitations (including extensions) applicable to the taxable period to
which such documents relate; (ii) the final determination of any
controversy with respect to such taxable period; (iii) the final
determination of any payments that may be required with respect to such
taxable period under this Agreement; or (iv) three years following the due
date with extensions for such Tax Returns. Prior to disposing of any such
records, notice shall be given to the other Party providing reasonable terms
allowing such other Party to take, at its sole expense, possession of such
records.

  



  

10.4 _Tax Proceedings_.  In the event Purchaser, an Acquired Company, or any
of their Affiliates receives notice of any examination, claim, adjustment or
other proceeding with respect to the liability of an Acquired Company (or
Seller or its Affiliates with respect to an Acquired Company) for Taxes for
any taxable period for which Seller is or may be liable under _Section
10.1_, Purchaser shall, within 10 days, notify Seller in writing thereof and
Seller shall be entitled, at its expense, to control or settle the contest of
such examination, claim, adjustment or other proceeding. Seller
and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other, and with their
respective Affiliates, and will consult with each other in the settlement of
any proceeding described in this _Section 10.4_ that could affect
the other. Purchaser will provide, or cause to be provided, to Seller and
its Affiliates necessary authorizations, including powers of attorney, to
control any such proceeding.

  



  

10.5 _Tax Indemnification Procedures_.

  



  

(a) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority that, if successful,
would result in the indemnification of a Party under _Section 10.1_ of this
Agreement (referred to herein as the " _Tax Indemnified Person_ "), the Tax
Indemnified Person shall, upon receiving notice of

  



        
   

  



  

such claim, promptly notify the Party obligated under this Agreement to so
indemnify (referred to herein as the " _Tax Indemnifying Person_ ") in
writing of such fact.

  



  

(b) The Tax Indemnifying Person shall, at its own expense, control all
proceedings taken in connection with such claim (including selection of
counsel and accountants), provided that (i) within thirty 30 days after the
notice described in _Section 10.5(a)_ has been delivered (or such earlier
date that any payment of Taxes is due by the Tax Indemnified Person but in no
event sooner than 10 days after the Tax Indemnifying Persons receipt of
such notice), the Tax Indemnifying Person requests that such claim be
contested, (ii) to the extent the Tax Indemnifying Person requests
participation from the Tax Indemnified Person as provided in the final
sentence of this _Section 10.5(b)_, the Tax Indemnifying Person shall have
agreed to pay to the Tax Indemnified Person all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses that the Tax Indemnified Person incurs in connection with
contesting such claim, including reasonable attorneys and accountants fees
and disbursements, and (iii) if the Tax Indemnified Person is requested by
the Tax Indemnifying Person to pay the Tax claims and sue for a refund, the
Tax Indemnifying Person shall have paid the Tax Indemnified Person the amount
of such claim. The Tax Indemnified Person shall not make any payment of such
claim for at least 30 days (or such shorter period as may be required by
applicable Law) after the giving of the notice required by _Section
10.5(a)_, shall give to the Tax Indemnifying Person any information
reasonably requested relating to such claim, and otherwise shall reasonably
cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Person in good faith in order to contest
effectively any such claim. The Tax Indemnified Person shall participate in
contesting such claim to the extent the Tax Indemnifying Person shall
reasonably request in writing from time to time (including the selection of
counsel and experts and the execution of powers of attorney).

  



  

(c) Subject to the provisions of _Section 10.5(b)_, the Tax Indemnified
Person shall enter into a settlement of such contest with the applicable
taxing authority or prosecute such contest to a determination in a court or
other tribunal of initial or appellate jurisdiction, all as the
Tax Indemnifying Person may request.

  



  

(d) If, after actual receipt by the Tax Indemnified Person of an amount paid
by the Tax Indemnifying Person pursuant to  _Section 10.5(b)(iii)_, the
extent of the liability of the Tax Indemnified Person with respect to the
claim shall be established by the final judgment and/or decree of a court or
other tribunal or a final and binding settlement with an administrative
agency having jurisdiction thereof, the Tax Indemnified Person shall promptly
repay the Tax Indemnifying Person the amount advanced to the extent of any
refund received by the Tax Indemnified Person with respect to the claim
together with any interest received thereon from the applicable taxing
authority and any recovery of legal fees from such taxing authority, net of
any Taxes as are required to be paid by the Tax Indemnified Person
with respect to such refund, interest or legal fees (calculated at the
maximum applicable statutory rate of Tax without regard to any other Tax
Items). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tax Indemnified Person shall not
be required to make any payment hereunder before such time as the Tax
Indemnifying Person shall have made all payments or indemnities then due with
respect to the Tax Indemnified Person pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

(e) Promptly after a final determination, the Tax Indemnifying Person shall
pay to the Tax Indemnified Person the amount of any Taxes to which the Tax
Indemnified Person may become entitled by reason of the provisions of this
_Article 10_.

  



  

10.6 _Tax Refund_. All Tax refunds, credits or overpayments of or relating to
an Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Period shall be the exclusive and sole
property of Seller. Promptly after Purchasers or an Acquired Companys
receipt thereof, Purchaser or such Acquired Company, as applicable, shall pay
the amount of any such refunds, credits, or overpayments to Seller, together
with interest (at the Applicable Rate) thereon from and after the date of
Purchasers or such Acquired Companys, as applicable, receipt of
such refunds, credits, or overpayments until such refunds, credits, or
overpayments are paid in full to Seller.

  



  

10.7 _Conveyance Taxes_.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, all Transfer Taxes arising out of, or directly
attributable to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
borne one-half by Seller and one-half by Purchaser. The Parties shall
cooperate to secure any available exemptions from any such Taxes and
in providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to
obtain such exemptions.

  



  

10.8 _338 Election_.  The Parties agree that no Party will make any election
under section 338 of the Code (or any election corresponding to section 338
of the Code under foreign, state or local laws) with respect to the purchase
of the shares of the AWS Subsidiaries.

  



  

10.9 _Closing of Books_.  The Parties intend that there be an interim closing
of the books of the AWS Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement and, to the extent necessary, agree to take
all actions necessary and appropriate (including providing the required
consent and filing any necessary forms, returns, elections, schedules and
other documents) as may be required to effect an interim closing of such
books.

  



  

10.10 _Miscellaneous_.  Purchaser and Seller agree to treat all payments made
by either of them to or for the benefit of the other (including any payments
to Seller) under this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to
the extent that the Laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise.

Article 10 and Article 11, this Article 10 shall control.

owned, occupied, used or leased by an Acquired Company prior to the Closing
Date, regardless of whether such Release or violation was alleged or

regardless of who discovered the Release or violation.

  



  

11.3 _Indemnification of Seller_.  Subject to, and to the extent and only to
the extent provided in, _Section 11.4_ and the other provisions of this
_Article 11_, from and after the Closing, Purchaser agrees to indemnify

agrees to hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from, any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Party to the extent
arising out of or resulting from any of the following:

  



        
   

  



  

(a) any breach of or any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by

pursuant to this Agreement; or

  



  

(b) any breach by Purchaser of, or failure by Purchaser to perform, any
covenant or obligation of Purchaser set out in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

11.4 _Limitations on Liability_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement or applicable Law:

  



  

(a) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have the right to indemnification
under _Section 11.2(a)_, only if, and only to the extent that, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall have incurred indemnifiable Losses in excess of
$750,000 **** (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall have a right to payment for the amount of such Losses in excess
of the Deductible; provided, however, that the limitations in this _clause
(a)_ shall not apply to any indemnification obligations of Seller arising
from a breach of the Special Warranties.

  



  

(b) Under no circumstances shall (i) the aggregate amount that the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties are entitled to be paid or recover under or in connection
with _Section 11.2(a)_ exceed $22,500,000 or (ii) the aggregate amount that
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to be paid or recover under or
in connection with _Sections 11.2(c)_ or _11.2(e)_ exceed the Purchase
Price.

  



  

(c) Any payments required to be made by Seller under _Section 11.2_ and
_Article 10_ shall be paid first from the Escrow Fund, in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and then by Seller.

  



  

(d) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedy for any
Losses arising as a result of any "Triggering Event" (as defined in the
Second Escrow Agreement) shall be Purchasers right to receive payments under
the Second Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (to the extent provided
in Section 3.5 of the Second Escrow Agreement) as provided therein, and
Purchaser on behalf of itself and each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties,
hereby waives, releases, and agrees not to assert any other rights or
remedies for other Losses of any nature or kind with respect thereto,
including any claim for indemnification under _Section 11.2_.

  



  

(e) Except for Losses arising from a third-party claim, in no event shall any
Indemnified Parties be indemnified against, held harmless for, paid for, or
entitled to make a claim for or recover any special, punitive, exemplary,
speculative, indirect, incidental or consequential damages or lost profits,
any diminution of value or multiples of earnings, whether or not the
possibility of such damages has been disclosed to the Indemnifying Party in
advance or could have been reasonably foreseen by the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(f) _Section 11.2_ and _Section 11.3_ shall not apply in respect of Tax
matters, which are covered by Article 10.

  



        
   

  



  

(g) From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive liability and
responsibility of an Indemnifying Party or a Tax Indemnifying Person to an
Indemnified Party or a Tax Indemnified Person, as applicable, under or in
connection with this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
or for any breach of or failure to perform any covenant or obligation or for
any other reason), and the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Parties or Tax Indemnified Persons, as applicable, with respect to any of the
foregoing, shall be as set forth in this _Article 11_,  _Article 10_ and,
where applicable, the Escrow Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements. To
the extent that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Tax Indemnified Persons
of Purchaser have any Losses for which they may assert any other right
to indemnification, contribution or recovery from Seller or any Affiliate
of Seller (whether under this Agreement, under any common law, or under
any Environmental Law or any statute or otherwise), Purchaser on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, hereby waives, releases and agrees not to assert
such right and agrees to cause each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and
Tax Indemnified Persons of Purchaser to waive, release and agree not to
assert such right.

  



  

(h) Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability under
or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby for any Loss (i) to the
extent arising as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in violation of this Agreement, (ii) to
the extent arising from or relating to any matter disclosed on the Disclosure
Letters (except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (e) of _Section
11.2_), (iii) to the extent arising from a change in Law that becomes
effective after the Closing Date and (iv) to the extent such Loss is accrued,
provided or reserved for in, or otherwise taken into account or rejected in
connection with, (A) the calculation of the Final Net Asset Value Amount or
the preparation of the Final Closing Net Asset Value Statement or (B) the
calculation of the Final Closing Net Cash Amount or the Final Closing Net
Cash Amount Statement.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
indemnification obligations under _Section 11.2_ shall not limit Purchasers
right to recover Losses that result from or arise out of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of Seller.

  



  

11.5 _Claims_. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming aware
of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement not involving a claim, or
the commencement of any Action, of the type described in _Section 11.6_, but
in any event no later than 10 Business Days after first becoming aware of
such claim, the Indemnified Party shall give notice to the Indemnifying Party
of such claim, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts
alleged to constitute the basis for such claim, the representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations alleged to have been breached and the
amount that the Indemnified Party seeks hereunder from the Indemnifying
Party, together with such information as may be necessary for the
Indemnifying Party to determine that the limitations in _Section 11.4_ have
been satisfied or do not apply, to the extent available; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice
shall not constitute a waiver of such Indemnified Partys rights and remedies
under this _Article 11,_ except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying
Party shall have been actually prejudiced thereby.

  



        
   

  



  

11.6 _Notice of Third-Party Claims; Assumption of Defense_. The Indemnified
Party shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable, but in any
event no later than five Business Days after receiving notice thereof, to the
Indemnifying Party of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any
Action, by any Person not an Indemnified Party hereunder in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under this Agreement, which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and amount of such claim, together with such
information as may be necessary for the Indemnifying Party to determine that
the limitations in _Section 11.4_ have been satisfied or do not apply;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give
such notice shall not constitute a waiver of such Indemnified Partys rights
and remedies under this _Article 11_ except to the extent (if any) that the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced thereby.
Provided that the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligation to indemnify
pursuant to _Section 11.2_ or _Section 11.3_, as the case may be, the
Indemnifying Party may, at its own expense, (a) participate in the defense of
any such claim or Action, and (b) upon notice to the Indemnified Party, at
any time during the course of any such claim or Action, assume and control
the defense thereof with counsel of its own choice and, in the event of such
assumption, shall have the exclusive right, subject to _Section 11.7_, to
settle or compromise such claim or Action.  If the Indemnifying Party assumes
such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right (but not the duty)
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any such
claim or Action, all of the Parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that Seller shall have the right to control the defense of, and the
sole authority to approve and authorize the filing of pleadings, briefs and
other documents on behalf of the Acquired Companies with respect to, the
matters which are the subject of _clauses (c)_ , _(d)_ and  _(e)_ of
_Section 11.2_ (including the Actions set forth on  _Exhibit 7.1(a)(xii)_)
(collectively, the "Retained Actions"). All responsibility for and control of
the Retained Actions shall transfer to Seller at the Effective Closing Time
without further action on the part of the Parties or the Acquired Companies.

  



  

11.7 _Settlement or Compromise_.  Any settlement or compromise made or caused
to be made by the Indemnified Party (unless the Indemnifying Party has the
exclusive right to settle or compromise under _clause (b)_ of _Section
11.6_) or the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, of any such claim or
Action of the kind referred to in _Section 11.6_ shall also be binding upon
the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, in the
same manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court
of competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the prior consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to any Action (other than an Action
set forth on _Exhibit 7.1(a)(xii)_) (A) if such judgment or settlement does
not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by such claimant or
plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in
respect to such claim, (B) if such judgment or settlement would result in the
finding or admission of any violation of applicable Law, or (C) if, as a
result of such consent or settlement, injunctive or other equitable relief
would be imposed against the Indemnified Party, or such settlement would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business,
assets or results of operations of the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole,
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, consent to

  



         
 

  



  

the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any
Action set forth on _Exhibit 7.1(a)(xii)_ if, as a result of such consent or
settlement, injunctive or other equitable relief (including a monitor) or
other similar obligation would be imposed against the Indemnified Party and
(iii) the Indemnified Party will not compromise or settle any claim or Action
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that Seller shall act, at Sellers expense,
on behalf of the Acquired Companies and shall have the sole authority,
subject to the provisions of this _Section 11.7_, to enter into
discussions, negotiations, settlements, compromises and judgments with any
plaintiffs or other Persons with respect to any Retained Action. Upon
Sellers request to Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly cause an appropriate
officer of each relevant Acquired Company to execute any document, agreement
or instrument evidencing any settlements, compromises or judgments with
respect to any Retained Action that have been authorized by Seller in
accordance with this _Section 11.7_.

  



  

11.8 _Net Losses and Subrogation; Mitigation_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of
any Losses incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Party shall be calculated
after giving effect to (i) any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified
Party (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Losses, (ii) any Tax
benefit realized by the Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) arising
from the facts or circumstances giving rise to such Losses or by the
Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) from any indemnification payment
with respect to such Losses and (iii) any recoveries obtained by the
Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) from any other third party.
 Each Indemnified Party shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain such proceeds, benefits and recoveries.  If any such proceeds,
benefits or recoveries are received by an Indemnified Party (or any of its
Affiliates) with respect to any Losses after the Indemnified Party has been
paid with respect thereto, the Indemnified Party (or such Affiliate) shall
pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such proceeds, benefits or
recoveries (up to the amount of the Losses for which the Indemnified Party
has been paid).

  



  

(b) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses,
the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to
all rights of the Indemnified Party (and its Affiliates) against any third
party in respect of the Losses to which such payment relates. Such
Indemnified Party (and its Affiliates) and Indemnifying Party will execute
upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence or further
perfect such subrogation rights.

  



  

(c) Each Indemnified Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Losses that such Indemnified Party asserts or is reasonably
likely to assert under this _Article 11_.

  



  

11.9 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.  Any amounts payable under _Section 11.2_
or _Section 11.3_ shall be treated by Purchaser and Seller as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 10.10_.

  



  

11.10 _Specific Performance_.  Each Party acknowledges that, in case of any
breach of its respective covenants or other obligations hereunder prior to
the Closing, the non-breaching Party

  



        
   

  



  

would suffer immediate and irreparable harm for which money damages would be
inadequate to remedy and, accordingly, in case of any such breach, the non-
breaching Party shall be entitled to obtain specific performance and other
equitable remedies, in addition to other remedies provided in this _Article
11_.

  



  

11.11 _Escrow Fund_.  At Closing, the Escrow Amount shall be deposited in
escrow pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_, which escrow deposit, together with the
interest earned thereon as provided therein, is referred to herein as the "
_Escrow Fund_." The Escrow Fund shall be held as security for the purposes
set forth in the Escrow Agreement and shall be disbursed in the manner set
forth in the Escrow Agreement.  The term of the Escrow Agreement shall,
except as expressly provided in the Escrow Agreement, be for a period of 18
months after the Closing Date (the " _Escrow Period_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Escrow Agreement shall not terminate (but shall continue
in full force and effect until claims are resolved) with respect to any
unresolved claims to which any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties has given
timely notice prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period. Upon the
expiration of the Escrow Period, the amount remaining in the Escrow Fund
shall, except as expressly provided in the Escrow Agreement, be disbursed to
Seller in the manner set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

11.12 _Second Escrow Fund_.  At Closing, the Second Escrow Amount shall be
deposited in escrow pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_, which escrow deposit,
together with the interest earned thereon as provided therein, is referred to
herein as the " _Second Escrow Fund_." The Second Escrow Fund shall be held
as security for the purposes set forth in the Second Escrow Agreement and
shall be disbursed in the manner set forth in the Second Escrow Agreement.
The term of the Second Escrow Agreement shall, except as expressly provided
in the Second Escrow Agreement, be for a period of 18 months after the
Closing Date (the " _Second Escrow Period_ "). Upon the expiration of the
Second Escrow Period, the amount remaining in the Second Escrow Fund
shall, except as expressly provided in the Second Escrow Agreement, be
disbursed to Seller in the manner set forth in the Second Escrow Agreement.

 MISCELLANEOUS**

12.1 _Further Assurances_.  At the request of the requesting Party, Purchaser
or Seller or the Acquired Companies, as applicable, shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such documents as Purchaser

counsel may reasonably request to further effectuate or evidence the
transactions set forth in _Article 2_. From and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall cause the Acquired Companies to remit promptly (but in any event within

Parties irrevocably elect, as the sole judicial forum for the adjudication of
any matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement, and consent
to the jurisdiction of, any state or federal court having competent
jurisdiction over the State of Delaware. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY ACTUAL OR PROPOSED TRANSACTION OR OTHER MATTER CONTEMPLATED

12.15 _Disclosure Letters_.

  



  

(a) Any information disclosed in any section of a Disclosure Letter shall be
deemed to be disclosed for all purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to the extent the relationship of such matter to such other
section of a Disclosure Letter is reasonably apparent on its face. Neither
the specification of any dollar amount or any item or matter in any provision
of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item or matter in any Disclosure Letter hereto or thereto is
intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
or matter so specified or included, or other items or matters, are or are not
material, and no Party shall use the fact of the specification of any such
amount or the specification or inclusion of any such item or matter in any
dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any item or matter
is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement.  Neither the specification of any item or matter in any provision
of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item or matter in any Disclosure Letter hereto or thereto is
intended to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or
are not in the ordinary course of business, and no Party shall use the fact
of the specification or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any
dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any item or matter
is or is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

  



  

(b) From time to time through the Closing, Seller, on the one hand, shall
notify Purchaser of, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall notify Seller
of, and shall supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure Letter with respect
to, any matter that (i) may arise after the Execution Date and that, if
existing or occurring at or prior to the Execution Date, would have been
required to be set forth or described in the Seller Disclosure Letter or (ii)
makes it necessary to correct any information in the Seller Disclosure Letter
or in any representation and warranty of Seller or Purchaser, as applicable,
that has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No such supplement or amendment to
the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to cure any breach of any
representation or warranty for purposes of _Section 8.1(a)_ or _Section
8.2(a)_ (as applicable) or for purposes of _Section 9.1(c)_ or _Section
9.1(d)_ (as applicable).
