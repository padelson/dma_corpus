-iii-  _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _Agreement_ "), dated
as of September 2, 2012, among Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Merlin Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ," the
Company and Merger Sub sometimes being hereinafter collectively referred to as
the " _Constituent Corporations_ "), and Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., a Canadian corporation ("Parent
Holdco").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
" _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises,
shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II.
The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ").

1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 1888 Century Park East, 21st
Floor, Los Angeles, California, at 9:00 A.M. on the fourth (4th) business day
(the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied
or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or

 



-1-   waived in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to effect the
Closing prior to the second (2nd) business day following the final day of the
Marketing Period, unless Parent shall request an earlier date on two (2)
business days prior written notice (but, subject in such case, to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
any such conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing
Date, which shall be required to be so satisfied or waived on
Parents requested Closing Date)). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_business day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other
than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or
authorized to close in the City of New York. " _Marketing Period_ " shall
mean the first period of twenty (20) consecutive calendar days, commencing not
less than two (2) days after the delivery of the Required
Information, throughout which (a) Parent shall have the Required Information
that the Company is required to provide to Parent pursuant to Section 6.14;
_provided_ that if the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe it has
provided the Required Information, it may deliver to Parent a written notice
to that effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery), in which
case the Company shall be deemed to have complied with this clause (a) unless
Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Company has not completed the
delivery of the Required Information and, within four (4) business days after
the delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the
Company to that effect (stating with specificity which Required Information
the Company has not delivered); for the avoidance of doubt, the Marketing
Period shall begin when the Company has provided such information and (b)
prior to the completion of such twenty (20) consecutive calendar day period,
Ernst and Young LLP shall not have withdrawn or qualified its audit opinion with
respect to any of the Required Information; _provided_ , that the Marketing
Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on which the Debt
Financing or the Bond Financing, as applicable, is consummated, and, for
purposes of such Marketing Period (i) the days from and including November 21,
2012 through November 25, 2012 shall not be considered calendar days and (ii)
if such period has not ended prior to December 20, 2012, such period shall be
deemed not to have commenced until January 2, 2013.

 

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _Delaware
Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties in
writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 



-2-  ARTICLE II

_Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_

_of the Surviving Corporation _

2.1. _The Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Charter_ ")
shall be amended in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub, until thereafter amended as provided therein or
by applicable Law (as defined in Section 5.1(i)).

2.2. _The By-Laws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the by-laws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _By-Laws_ "),
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

ARTICLE III

 

 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

3.1. _Directors and Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all actions
necessary so that (a) the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective
Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Charter and the By-Laws and (b) the officers of the
Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the By-Laws.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Certificates_

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the Class A Common Stock, par value
$0.014 per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) Shares owned by Parent Holdco, Merger Sub or any other direct
or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent Holdco and Shares owned by the
Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares
that are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who
have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (each, an " _Excluded Share_ " and

 



-3-   collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the right to
receive $44.00 per Share (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At
the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
formerly representing any of the Shares and each non-certificated
share represented by book entry (a " _Book Entry Share_ ") (other than, in
each case, Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder thereof may have under Section 4.2(f) and the DGCL.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares,
a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to
make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations
of or guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no
such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section
4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to Parent. No investment of the funds shall
relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from making the
payments required by this Article IV, and following any net losses from any
such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the applicable holders of Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time in the amount of such net losses, which additional
funds shall be deemed to be part of the funds. No investment of the funds
shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



-4-  (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within two (2) business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of
Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
and Book Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 4.2(e))
or Book Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in Section 4.2(e)) or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) or Book Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax (as
defined in Section 5.1(o)) withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal
to (A) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) or Book Entry
Shares multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration and the
Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the
Certificate or Book Entry Shares may be issued to such transferee if the
Certificate or Book Entry Shares formerly representing such Shares is
presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash
amount in immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate
or Book Entry Shares is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment
of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender
of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates) or
Book Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any
other

 



-5-   Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section 5.1(d)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be reasonably required by Parent
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to the number of Shares represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in
Section 5.1(o)) Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and
(ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, shall provide commercially reasonable

 



-6-   notice to each applicable holder of Shares upon becoming aware of any such
withholding obligation and shall cooperate with such holder to the extent
reasonable to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction and
withholding.

4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Each option to purchase Shares granted under the
Stock Plans (as defined in Section 5.1(b)(i)) (a " _Company Option_ "),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to
receive, within eight (8) days following the Effective Time, an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to the
Company Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company Option
less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment.
For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Option that has an exercise price
that equals or exceeds the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist without receiving any payment.

(b) _Treatment of Stock Appreciation Rights_. Each stock appreciation right
relating to Shares granted under the Stock Plans (a " _Company SAR_ "),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof
to receive, within eight (8) days following the Effective Time, an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to the
Company SAR multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company SAR less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. For the
avoidance of doubt, each Company SAR that has an exercise price that equals or
exceeds the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist without receiving any payment.

(c)  _Treatment of Restricted Shares_. Each Share that is subject to
restrictions and that was granted under the Stock Plans (a " _Company
Restricted Share_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall only entitle the holder thereof
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration under Section 4.1(a) less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld.

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections
4.3(a), 4.3(b) and 4.3(c). The Company shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Options, Company SARs or Company Restricted Shares.

 

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or

 



-7-   exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as
a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

ARTICLE V

_Representations and Warranties_

 

5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the Company Reports (as defined below) filed with the SEC since January 1,
2011 and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, in
each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section or in any
other section to the extent they are forward-looking statements
or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in the
corresponding sections of the disclosure schedule delivered to Parent by the
Company immediately prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other section to the extent (and only to the extent) that the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub that:

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (as defined below) is a legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction
of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority, are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below). The Company has delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of
the Companys and its Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and by-laws
or comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date of this
Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full force and effect. Section
5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list
of each jurisdiction where the Company and its Subsidiaries are organized and
qualified to do business.

 

As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect
to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the
securities or ownership interests having by their terms ordinary voting power
to elect a majority of the board of directors or other persons performing
similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such
Person and/or by one or more of its Subsidiaries, (ii) " _Company Material
Adverse Effect_ " means any material adverse effect on the financial
condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business or results of operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_
, that none of the following, in and of itself or themselves, shall constitute
a Company Material Adverse Effect:

 

(A) changes in the economy or financial markets generally in the United States
or any foreign jurisdiction;

 



-8-  (B) changes that are the result of factors generally affecting
the pharmaceutical industry;

(C) changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles ("

stock or other securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the
Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company,

obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only to
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders meeting duly called
and held for such purpose (the " _Requisite Company Vote_ "). This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (assuming due and valid authorization, execution and

fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to
general equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

_SEC_ ") of the Proxy Statement in definitive form (the " _Company Approvals_
"), no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by the
Company with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any domestic or
foreign governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court
or other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity (each, a "
_Governmental Entity_ "), in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, or in connection with
the continuing operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time, except those that the failure to make or obtain
are not, individually or in the 

 



-12-   aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or by-laws
of the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or default under, the

assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any agreement,
lease, license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other
obligation (each, a " _Contract_ ") in each case, that would be binding upon
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with respect to
performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 5.1(d)(i), under any Law to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject, or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Contract binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C)
above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation,
acceleration or change that is not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of Material Contracts (as
defined in Section 5.1(j)(i)) pursuant to which consents or waivers are or may
be required prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (whether or not subject to the exceptions set forth with respect to
clauses (B) and (C) above).

(iii) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by
any non-competition Contract or other Contract, in each case, that purports to
limit in any material respect either the type of business in which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or, after giving effect to the Merger,
Parent or its Subsidiaries) may engage, including the development,
commercialization, manufacture, marketing, sale or distribution of any
Company Product that is material or would be reasonably be expected to become
material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the manner or locations
in which any of them may so engage in any business with respect to the Company
Products. As used in this Agreement, (A) the term " _Products_ " means all
"drugs" and "devices" as those terms are defined in Section 201 of the Federal

all biological, pharmaceutical and drug candidates, compounds or products, and
(B) the term " _Company Products_ " means all Products that are being
researched, tested, developed, commercialized,

 



-13-   manufactured, sold or distributed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

has royalty rights.

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), or the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), since January 1, 2011 (the " _Applicable
Date_ ") (the forms, statements, reports and documents filed or furnished
since the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date
of this Agreement, including any amendments thereto, the " _Company Reports_
"). The Company has made available to Parent true, complete and unredacted
copies of the Company Reports filed or furnished prior to the date of this
Agreement, in each case to the extent not publicly filed in unredacted form.
Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished (or,
if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseded filing),
complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and
any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company
Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date of
this Agreement or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseded filing),
the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with or furnished
to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

 

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE. Except as
permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3) or rules of
the SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the Company
nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material
way) any extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan to any executive
officer or director of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Affiliate_ ," when used with respect to any party, shall mean any Person who
is an "affiliate" of that party within the meaning of Rule 405 promulgated
under the Securities Act.

(iii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed and maintained to ensure that information

 



-14-   required to be disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely
basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys
filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company
maintains internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15
or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over
financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on its
financial statements. The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent
evaluation of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer
prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and the audit
committee of the Companys board of directors (A) any significant deficiencies
in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and has identified
for the Companys auditors and audit committee of the Companys board of
directors any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting
and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. To the knowledge of the Company, since the Applicable
Date, no material complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal
accounting controls or auditing matters have been received by the Company. 

(iv) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of Company Reports filed after the
date of this Agreement, will fairly present, the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries in all material
respects, as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference
into the Company Reports (including any related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, or in the case of Company Reports filed after the date of
this Agreement, will fairly present in all material respects, the results of
operations, accumulated earnings (or losses) and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of such companies for the periods set forth
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal
year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect), in
each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein.

 



-15-  (f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2011, (i) the
Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only
in, and have not engaged in any material transaction other than in accordance
with, the ordinary course of such businesses consistent with past practices,
(ii) there has not been any circumstance, occurrence or development which,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect and (iii) there has not been any action taken
by the Company or its Subsidiaries that would have required the consent of
Parent pursuant to Sections 6.1(a)(iii), (vii), (viii), (ix), (x), (xii),
(xiii), (xiv), (xv) or (xvii) if such action had been taken after the date of
this Agreement or any agreement to take any such actions.

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_.

 

(i) (A) There are no pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings
(each, an " _Action_ ") before any Governmental Entity to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or any Action by any Governmental Entity
against or involving the Company or its Subsidiaries, and (B) the Company is
not subject to any outstanding judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or
award of any Governmental Entity, in each case that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

(ii) There are no material obligations or liabilities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) that would be
required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto,
other than:

(A) obligations or liabilities to the extent (I) reflected on the consolidated
balance sheet of the Company, (II) readily apparent in the notes thereto or
(III) included in the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended June 30, 2012;

 

(B) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since June 30, 2012; or

(C) liabilities arising from contractual arrangements entered into in the
ordinary course of business, including obligations with respect to employment
agreements (none of which results from, arises out of, relates to, is in the
nature of, or was caused by any breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort,
infringement or violation of Law).

(h) _Employee Benefits_.

 

(i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, agreements or policies
covering current or former U.S. employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, current or former U.S. directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries

 



-16-   and current or former U.S. consultants of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "),
and deferred compensation, severance, change of control, retention, gross-up,
stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right, stock-based,
incentive, bonus, supplemental retirement and any profit sharing plans and
agreements (the " _Benefit Plans_ "), in each case, that are material are
listed on Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. True and
complete copies of all Benefit Plans listed on Section 5.1(h)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, including, to the extent applicable, any trust
instruments, insurance contracts and, with respect to any employee stock
ownership plan, loan agreements forming a part of any Benefit Plans, and all
amendments thereto have been made available to Parent.

(ii) Each Benefit Plan was established and has been maintained and
administered in compliance in all material respects with the terms thereof and
the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Law. Each
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") with respect to its qualified status
under Section 401(a) of the Code or has pending or has time remaining in
which to file an application for such determination from the IRS (or the
Company and its Subsidiaries are entitled to rely on a favorable opinion or
advisory letter issued by the IRS in accordance with Revenue
Procedure 2005-16 with respect to the qualified status of the plan document),
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no fact or circumstance that
exists that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
give rise to the revocation of such qualified status.

(iii) All contributions required to be made under each Benefit Plan, as of the
date of this Agreement have been timely made and all obligations in respect
of each Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the most
recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the
Company Reports prior to the date of this Agreement. To the knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period
of such transaction expired as of the date of this Agreement, could subject
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would
be material. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax or penalty
in a material amount imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA or any material liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.

(iv) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any other entity which
is a member of the same "controlled group" as the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code maintains
or contributes to or has within the past six complete calendar years
maintained or 

 



-17-   contributed to or been required to contribute to, and no Benefit Plan is, a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), a multiple
employer plan (within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA or Section 413(c)
of the Code) or an "employee pension benefit plan" (within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

 

(v) Except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1985, as amended, or similar state or local Law, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to provide any retiree health or life
insurance benefits to any employee or former employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

 

(vi) Excluding non-material routine claims for benefits, there is no action,
suit, audit, claim, proceeding or, to the knowledge of the Company,
investigation pending against or involving or threatened against any Benefit
Plan before any court or arbitrator or any Governmental Entity, or federal,
state or local official that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to a material liability.

(vii) Except for the cash-out of equity compensation awards under Section
4.3, none of the execution of this Agreement, the stockholder adoption of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will
(whether alone or in connection with any other event(s)) (A) entitle any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any
increase in severance pay (or other compensation or benefits) upon any
termination of employment, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any
compensation or benefits under, or materially increase the amount payable
under any of the Benefit Plans or result in any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans, (C) limit or restrict the right of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to merge,
amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans, (D) result in payments under any
of the Benefit Plans or otherwise which would constitute an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or would disqualify
any amount from being qualified performance-based compensation within the
meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code; or (E) result in any material breach or
other material violation of or under any employment agreement, or any other
labor-related agreement concerning the employees of the Company or to which
any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any such
entity is bound.

(viii) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent plan year.

 



-18-  (ix) No Benefit Plan or other agreement provides any person with any
amount of additional compensation or gross-up if such individual is provided
amounts subject to excise or additional taxes imposed under Section 4999 of
the Code.

(x) Each Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is in documentary compliance
with, and has been operated and administered in compliance with, Section 409A
of the Code and the guidance issued by the IRS provided thereunder in all
material respects.

(xi) No Benefit Plan or other agreement provides any person with any amount of
additional compensation or tax gross-up payment if such individual is provided
amounts subject to excise or additional federal income taxes imposed under
Section 409A of the Code or the California income tax equivalent.

 

(xii) Each Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued
(except with respect to accrued obligations under each respective Benefit
Plan) after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms without material
liabilities to Parent, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than
ordinary administration expenses typically incurred in a termination event.

(xiii) With respect to each material scheme or arrangement mandated by a
government other than the United States and with respect to each Benefit Plan
that is subject to the Laws of the jurisdiction outside of the United States
(a " _Foreign Benefit Plan_ "), the Company and its Subsidiaries have no
material unfunded or underfunded liabilities for each such Foreign Benefit
Plan that provides for pension or retiree welfare benefits. Each Foreign
Benefit Plan which, under the Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United
States, is required to be registered or approved by any governmental entity
or agency, has been so registered and approved and has been maintained in good
standing in all material respects with applicable governmental entities or
agencies, and if intended to qualify for special tax treatment, meets all
requirements for such treatment in all material respects.

(i) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. Since January 1, 2011, the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been and are in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws, statutes or ordinances,
common law, or any rules, regulations, standards, judgments, orders, writs,
injunctions, decrees, arbitration awards and agency requirements
(collectively, "Laws"), and all material licenses, permits, certificates,
approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations, franchises, variances,
and exemptions necessary for the Company or any such Subsidiary to own, lease
and operate its properties or other assets and to carry on its respective
business (the " _Company Permits_ ") and all such Company Permits are valid,

States Food and Drug Administration (" _FDA_ ") promulgated thereunder; (ii)
federal Medicare and Medicaid statutes and comparable state or local statutes
or regulations; (iii) the Food and Drugs Act, as amended (the " _Food and

with respect to any other section to the extent (and only to the extent) that
the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure), Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that:

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in
such good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) _Corporate Authority_. No vote of holders of capital stock of Parent is
necessary to approve this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate
power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to

(i) Assuming the truth and completeness of the representations and warranties
of the Company contained in this Agreement, other than the filings and/or
notices pursuant to Section 1.3 and under the HSR Act (the " _Parent
Approvals_ "), no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by
Parent or Merger Sub with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals,
permits or authorizations required to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub
from, any

 



-35-   Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, except those that the failure to make or obtain would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result
in (A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of Parent or Merger Sub or the comparable governing
instruments of any of their respective Subsidiaries, (B) with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination
(or right of termination) or a default under, the creation or acceleration of
any obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Contracts binding upon Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws or governmental or non-governmental
permit or license to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is subject; or
(C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any of such
Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any breach,
violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) _Available Funds_. As of the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub will
have available to them, directly or through one or more Affiliates, all funds
necessary to consummate the Merger and for the payment to the Paying Agent of
the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and to satisfy all of their
obligations under this Agreement. Parent has delivered to the Company true,
complete and correct copies, including all exhibits, schedules or amendments
thereto, of the fully executed commitment letter, dated as of the date
hereof, among Parent Holdco, Parent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC (collectively, the " _Lender Parties_ ") (the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the Lender Parties have committed,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to lend the
amounts set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Debt Financing_ ").
The Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any manner
prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent Holdco, Parent nor Merger
Sub has entered into any agreement, side letter or other arrangement relating
to the financing of the payments to be made by them at the Effective Time or
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than as set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the fee letter and engagement letters related
thereto. The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents
a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent Holdco and Parent and,
to the knowledge of the Parent, Parent Holdco and Merger Sub, the Lender
Parties, to

 



-36-   provide the financing contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
and, subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other laws of general application
relating to or affecting rights of creditors. Parent Holdco and Parent have
fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other
amounts, if any, that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. As of the date of this
Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 5.1 such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) is
satisfied, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent Holdco or
Parent, or, to the knowledge of Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub, the
Lender Parties thereto under the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of
this Agreement, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 5.1 such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a)
is satisfied, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under this
Agreement, neither Parent Holdco, Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to
believe that they or the Lender Parties will be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis any term of the Debt Commitment Letter and the fee letters. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Debt Financing, other than the conditions precedent set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (as defined in the Debt
Commitment Letter). Parent Holdco, Parent and Merger Sub understand and
acknowledge that under the terms of this Agreement, Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to consummate the Merger are not in any way contingent upon or
otherwise subject to Parent Holdcos, Parents or Merger Subs consummation of
any financing arrangements, Parent Holdcos, Parents or Merger Subs
obtaining of any financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension
of any financing to Parent Holdco, Parent or Merger Sub.

(e) _Proxy Statement_. The information supplied by or on behalf of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or agents in writing,
expressly for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date of
filing with the SEC or at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any
representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by any
other Person that is included in the Proxy Statement.

(f) _Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_. Parent owns one hundred
percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub.
Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred
in connection with its formation and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Merger Sub has not and will not have incurred, directly or
indirectly, through any Subsidiary or Affiliate or otherwise, any obligations
or liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind
whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Person.

 



-37-  (g) _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, (i) there is no pending (or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing) Action before any
Governmental Entity to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
any Action by any Governmental Entity against or involving Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries and (ii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any outstanding Order, in each case that would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(h) _Interested Stockholder_. None of Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their
respective Affiliates is, or has been at any time during the period commencing
three (3) years prior to the date hereof through the date hereof, an
"interested stockholder" of the Company, as such term is defined in Section
203 of the DGCL. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries owns (beneficially or otherwise) any shares of Common Stock
or any other equity interests in the Company or any options, warrants or
other rights to acquire Common Stock or any other equity interests in the
Company (or any other economic interest through derivative securities or
otherwise in the Company).

 

(i) _Broker_. The Company will not be responsible for any brokerage, finders,
financial advisors or other fee or commission payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by
and on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub.

(j) _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties in this Section 5.2, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any Person
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any express or implied representation
or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other
information provided to the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

consummation of the Merger or result in any of the conditions to the Merger
set forth in Article VII not being satisfied; or

(xix) agree, authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.

(b) Prior to making any formal written communications or group oral
presentations to the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are
affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall
have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication
(which comments shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable
communication.

(c) Subject to Section 6.5, Parent shall not take or permit any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that is reasonably likely to prevent,
interfere with or delay the consummation of the Merger or result in any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied.

 



-42-  6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to instruct
and cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (such directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries or
the making of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below); or

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to, or
cooperate in any way with, any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to
any Acquisition Proposal; or

(iii) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any "standstill"
or confidentiality or similar obligation of any Person (other than any party
hereto) with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time,
but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company may (A)
provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal providing for a
merger or consolidation or acquisition of assets representing at least 50% of
the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company or more than
50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company;
_provided_ , that (x) prior to providing such information, the Company enters
into a confidentiality agreement with such Person on terms not less
restrictive to such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined in Section 6.5(c)) and (y) such confidentiality
agreement shall not prohibit the Company from providing any information to
Parent and such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill
provision, and the Company promptly discloses (and, if applicable, provides
copies of) any such information to Parent to the extent not previously
provided to Parent; (B) engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal; or (C) after having complied with Section
6.2(c), approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose
to approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (I) such Acquisition
Proposal was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated in breach of
this Section 6.2, (II) prior to taking any action described in clause (A),
(B) or (C) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (III) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B)
above, the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith
based on the information then available and after consultation

 



-43-   with its financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes
a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, and (IV) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the
board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.2(a) by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.2(a) by the Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company and its Representatives may in any event have
discussions with any Person solely to clarify and understand the terms and
conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by such Person.

(b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) any acquisition by any person resulting in, or proposal
or offer, which if consummated would result in, any person becoming the
beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related
transactions, 20% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity
securities of the Company or those of any of its Subsidiaries, or assets
(including, without limitation, equity securities of its Subsidiaries)
representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets
of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal
that would result in any person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or
indirectly, of assets representing more than 50% of the consolidated revenues,
net income or assets of the Company or more than 50% of the total voting
power of the equity securities of the Company that the board of directors of
the Company has determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to
be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making
the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable
to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any
revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by Section 6.2(c) of
this Agreement and the time likely to be required to consummate
such Acquisition Proposal).

(c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
board of directors of the Company and each committee of the board of
directors shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent,

 



-44-   the Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger (it being understood
that the board of directors may take no position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal until the earlier of the close of business as of (A) the
day prior to the Stockholders Meeting and (B) the tenth business day after the
commencement of such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act without such action being considered an adverse modification);
or

(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section
8.3(a) hereof, cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered into in compliance with
Section 6.2(a)) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any
Acquisition Proposal.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the board of
directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company
Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any
Superior Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that was
not solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated in breach of Section 6.2
of this Agreement, if the board of directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no Change of Recommendation may be made until after at least three (3)
business days following Parents receipt of notice from the Company advising
that management of the Company currently intends to recommend to its board of
directors that it take such action and the basis therefor, including
all necessary information under Section 6.2(f). In addition, the Company may
not exercise its termination rights pursuant to Section 8.3(a) unless, in
addition to the conditions set forth in Section 8.3(a), (i) the Company
notifies Parent in writing that it intends to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall
include all of the necessary information under Section 6.2(f) and (ii) Parent
does not make, within three (3) business days of receipt of the Companys
written notification of its intention to enter into a binding agreement for a
Superior Proposal, an offer that the board of directors of the Company
determines, in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors, is
at least as favorable, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of
the Company as the Superior Proposal. In determining whether to make a Change
of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise, the board
of directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by
Parent in response to such notice. During the three (3) business day period
referenced in this clause (c), the Company agrees, if requested by Parent, to
negotiate in good faith with Parent with respect to any revisions to the terms
of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. Any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.2(c), including with
respect to the notice period referred to in this Section 6.2(c).

 



-45-  (d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure does
not reaffirm the Company Recommendation or has the substantive effect of
withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that it is understood and agreed that a factually accurate public
statement by the Company concerning financial results, operations or business
conditions or developments, or that describes the Companys receipt of an
Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto,
or any "stop, look and listen" communication by the board of directors of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any similar
communication to the stockholders of the Company, shall not constitute a
Change of Recommendation.

(e)  _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary
steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2 and in the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also agrees that it will promptly
request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
in connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its
Subsidiaries to return all confidential information heretofore furnished to
such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

(f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements,
financing commitments, and written summaries of any material terms not made in
writing) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current
basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
including any change in the Companys intentions as previously notified.

 

6.3. _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_. The Company shall prepare and file
with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and in any event within 15 days after the date of this Agreement, a
proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (as
defined in

 



-46-   Section 6.4) (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement
thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that (a) the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and (b) none of the information supplied by
it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to stockholders of the
Company or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

6.4. _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Stockholders
Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement, and shall
not postpone or adjourn such meeting except to the extent required by Law or
if at the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Stockholders Meeting or to provide the Requisite Company
Vote or as may be reasonably necessary to solicit the adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of Shares. Subject to Section 6.2(a) hereof, the
board of directors of the Company shall recommend such adoption and shall
take all lawful action to solicit such adoption of this Agreement. In the
event that subsequent to the date hereof, the board of directors of the
Company determines that this Agreement is no longer advisable and makes a
Change of Recommendation, the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement
to the holders of the Shares for adoption at the Stockholders Meeting unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior
to the Stockholders Meeting.

6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. (a) _Proxy Statement_. The
Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and
shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the
Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments
received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC, and the Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon
or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

(b) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to

 



-47-   consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing and
filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable
all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary
or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement, including this clause (b), shall require, or be construed
to require, Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate and agree to sell,
divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber before or
after the Effective Time, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, divestiture, lease, license,
transfer, disposition or other encumberment by the Company of any of its
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein or to any agreement by the Company to take any of the foregoing
actions) or to agree to any changes (including through a licensing
arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of Parents ability to own
or operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines,
businesses or interests therein or Parents ability to vote,
transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with
respect to the stock of the Surviving Company (any of the foregoing, "
_Detriments_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parents "reasonable
best efforts" obligation shall require Parent to (i) sell, license or
otherwise dispose of (or agree to sell, license or otherwise dispose of),
businesses or assets of either Parent, the Company or their Subsidiaries that
in the aggregate produced net revenues in an amount not in excess of
$325,000,000 for Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries during
the 2011 fiscal year calculated in accordance with GAAP, on a basis consistent
with the accounting principles used in preparing their respective 2011
audited financial statements as filed with the SEC (provided that (x) in the
case of businesses or assets that were acquired during the 2011 fiscal year,
the net revenues with respect to the business or assets that were so acquired
shall include the net revenues produced by the transferee in the 2011 fiscal
year prior to such acquisition, (y) with respect to a product that was
introduced in the 2011 fiscal year or the 2012 fiscal year,
aggregate produced net revenues for purposes of this calculation shall mean
such amounts projected in the most recent regularly prepared budget for the
first fiscal year following the year in which the product launches and (z) in
the case of businesses or assets that were acquired during the 2012 fiscal
year, the net revenues with respect to the businesses or assets that were so
acquired shall include net revenues for the 2011 calendar year as reflected on
the most recent regularly prepared audited financial statements of the
transferee, calculated in accordance with GAAP) (the " _Detriments Limit_ ")
and (ii) sell or otherwise dispose of businesses or assets that Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent agrees to acquire after the date of this Agreement,
without regard to the Detriments Limit, and such sale or disposal shall not be
included in the calculation of the Detriments Limit, in each case if such
action should be reasonably necessary to (x) obtain any consent or approval
required for the consummation of the Merger under Section 7.1(b) or (y)
eliminate, terminate or remove the issuance of any Order described in Section
7.1(c), to the extent related to antitrust or competition matters, in each
case prior to March 4, 2013 (if the Termination

 



-48-   Date is not extended as provided in Section 8.2) or June 3, 2013 (if the
Termination Date is so extended). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however,
Parent shall not be required to agree to any such dispositions (and shall be
entitled in good faith to contest any threatened or pending litigation or
proceeding brought by any Governmental Entity) unless failure to do so would
result in the closing conditions not being met hereunder prior to the earlier
of (1) the termination of this Agreement and (2) March 4, 2013 (if the
Termination Date is not extended as provided in Section 8.2) or June 3, 2013
(if the Termination Date is so extended). If requested by Parent, the Company
will agree to any action contemplated by this Section 6.5(b), _provided_ that
such agreement or action is conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees
to make any appropriate filings, if necessary or advisable, pursuant to the
HSR Act or other applicable foreign, federal, state or supranational
antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Laws with respect to the Merger
as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) business days of
the date hereof (unless otherwise mutually agreed between the parties). The
Company and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period
with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. Subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information and subject to the limitations and
conditions set forth herein, (x) Parent and the Company shall jointly direct
all matters with any Governmental Entity consistent with their obligations
hereunder (with Parents legal counsel taking the lead in such matters);
provided, that to the extent Parent and the Company are unable to come to
agreement on such matters, the respective Chief Executive Officers of the
Company and Parent Holdco shall work in good faith to resolve such matters (it
being understood that in the event the two Chief Executive Officers are unable
to come to agreement, Parent shall have the right to make the determination
(acting in good faith) with respect to such disputed matter) and (y) Parent
and the Company shall each have the right to review in advance and, to the
extent practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in
good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Proxy Statement). In exercising the foregoing rights,
each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.

(c) _Information_. Subject to the Laws relating to the exchange
of information, the Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other,
furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or
any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be obligated to provide such information if the Company
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would (i) violate
applicable Law, (ii) violate a Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing
to a third party if the Company shall have used

 



-49-   commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to
such disclosure, or (iii) jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client
privilege. Until the Effective Time, the information provided will be subject
to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of July 14, 2011, as
amended on February 27, 2012 and August 27, 2012, by and between Parent and
the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

(d) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and as required by any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices
or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change,
fact or condition that is reasonably expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to Parents obligations to
effect the Merger;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Companys failure to
comply with the foregoing shall not give rise to a termination right by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.4(d). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent,
and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or
other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger or from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent and (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which
relate to the Merger. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its
officers or any other representatives or agents to participate in any in-
person meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance. The Company shall
not initiate any offer to any Government Entity with respect to any proposed
Detriment.

6.6. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to
its employees, properties, books, contracts and records (provided that Parent
and its Representatives shall not conduct any activities in such a manner as
to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company) and,
during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested, _provided_ that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in

 



-50-   the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or
(ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6
shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the
Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

6.7. _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation
of the Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Shares under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event no more than ten (10) days after the Closing Date.

 

6.8. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company
and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult with each other prior
to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may be required
by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of
any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the
request of any Governmental Entity and except for any public announcement
contemplated by Section 6.2(d). Each of Parent and the Company may make any
public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls, so long as such statements are substantially similar to
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent and the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will no longer
be required to obtain any prior consent of, or consult with, Parent in
connection with any such press release or public announcement if the
Companys board of directors has effected any Change of Recommendation or
shall have resolved to do so.

6.9. _Employee Benefits_. (a) Parent agrees that, during a period of twelve
(12) months immediately following the Closing Date, the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who remain employed following the Effective Time
(the " _Continuing Employees_ ") will be provided with the retention bonuses,
benefits and severance benefits set forth on Schedule 6.9(a).

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans in which any Continuing
Employee first becomes eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time
(any such plans, the " _New Plans_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all preexisting conditions,
actively at work requirements, 

 



-51-   exclusion and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements under the New Plans to the extent they were inapplicable to, or
were satisfied under, the Benefit Plans, (ii) recognize service of the
Continuing Employees prior to the Effective Time which was credited under the
Benefit Plans for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit
accrual) under the New Plans to the same extent such service was credited
under the Benefit Plans (except to the extent it would result in a duplication
of benefits), as if such service were with the Surviving Corporation, and
(iii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents under the Benefit Plans during the portion of the
plan year ending on the date such Continuing Employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan benefits to be taken into account under such plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
connection with such New Plan. 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company shall (i) cause to be amended the Benefit Plans to
the extent necessary to provide that no employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall commence participation therein following the
Effective Time unless the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly
authorizes such participation and (ii) cause the Medicis Pharmaceutical
Corporation 401(k) Plan to be terminated effective three (3) days prior to the
Effective Time. 

(d) All formal written communications to the directors, officers or employees
of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or
benefit matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be subject to Parents prior consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
period of time to review and comment on each such communication (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any formal group oral presentations with
respect to the above shall be materially consistent with such formal
written communications.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan, (ii) otherwise obligate
Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates to maintain any particular
Benefit Plan, (iii) otherwise obligate Parent, the Company or any of their
Affiliates to retain the employment of any particular Continuing Employee
following the Effective Time or (iv) give any third party the right to enforce
any of the provisions of this Section 6.9.

6.10. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5, whether or not

after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting
in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including in connection with
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section 6.11
and including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under Delaware Law and its certificate of incorporation or by-laws
in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (and Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification); and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required
to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies
with the standards set forth under Delaware Law and the Companys certificate
of incorporation and by-laws shall be made by independent counsel selected by
the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 6.11, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of
any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before
or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that
if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as

 



-53-   statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to
pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would
present such counsel with a conflict of interest, _provided_ that the fewest
number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used;
(ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies (providing only
for the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies
also include Side B coverage for the Company) with a claims period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits and
levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Company expend for such policies a premium amount in excess of the amount
set forth in Section 6.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. If the
Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue
to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement
with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such
six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies an aggregate premium
amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company
for such insurance; and, _provided_ _further_ that if the aggregate premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation
shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation

addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

(g) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.11 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.11 applies
unless (i) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(ii) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Party to whom this Section 6.11 applies shall be a third party beneficiary of
this Section 6.11).

take all necessary action to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture to

agreement made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, such that Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied and such
breach or condition is not cured within the earlier of (A) 30 days after
written notice thereof is given by the Company to Parent and (B) the
Termination Date.

a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Shares shall have been
publicly disclosed (other than by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent) and, prior
to the earlier of (i) the date prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting
and (ii) eleven (11) business days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company
board of directors fails to recommend against acceptance of such offer or (d)
there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such representation
and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, such
that Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) would not be satisfied and such breach or
condition is not cured within the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after
written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company and (ii) the
Termination Date.

8.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. (a) Except as provided in
paragraph (b) below, in the event of termination of this Agreement and the
abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement shall
become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of
any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_
, _however_ , and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary,
that (i) no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability
or damages to the other party hereto resulting from any willful and material
breach of this Agreement and (ii) the provisions set forth in this Section
8.5 and the second sentence of Section 9.1 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement, and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive in accordance
with its terms.

 



-63-  (b) In the event that (i) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its stockholders or
any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (and such Acquisition Proposal or publicly announced
intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn without qualification at
least ten (10) days prior to, with respect to any termination pursuant to
Section 8.2(a), the date of termination, and with respect to termination
pursuant to Section 8.2(b) the date of the Stockholders Meeting) and
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (Drop Dead) or 8.2(b) (No Stockholder Approval),
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a), (b) or
(c) or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.3(a) (Fiduciary Out), then the Company shall promptly, but in no event
later than two (2) days after the date of such termination, pay Parent a
termination fee of $85,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") and reimburse
reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by Parent or
Merger Sub up to a maximum of $7,500,000 in the aggregate ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Termination Fee to be paid pursuant to clause (iii) shall
be paid as set forth in Section 8.3), in each case payable by wire transfer
of same day funds; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Termination Fee and
reimbursement of expenses shall be payable to Parent pursuant to clause (i) of
this paragraph (b) unless and until within 12 months of such termination, (I)
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or shall have consummated or shall have
approved or recommended to the Companys stockholders or otherwise not
opposed, an Acquisition Proposal or (II) there shall have been consummated an
Acquisition Proposal (substituting in both instances "50%" for "20%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal"). The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.5(b) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger
Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
fee set forth in this Section 8.5(b) or any portion of such fee, the Company
shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge
that in the event that the Termination Fee and any reimbursement of expenses
pursuant to this Section 8.5(b) becomes payable and is paid by the Company and
accepted by Parent pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), the Termination Fee and
such reimbursement of expenses shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole and
exclusive remedy.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE

9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.11
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) and this Section 9.8
only, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not,
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein, and except that the Financing Sources and their
respective current, former or future directors, officers, general or limited
partners, stockholders, members, managers, controlling persons, Affiliates,
employees or Representatives shall be third party beneficiaries of Section 9.5
and this Section 9.8 and shall have the right to consent to any modification
of Section 9.5 and this Section 9.8 to the extent such modification directly
affects their interests. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of
third party beneficiaries under Section 6.11 shall not arise unless and until
the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with Section 9.3 without notice or liability to any other Person.
In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, nothing shall
preclude the Company from pursuing equitable remedies pursuant to Section
9.5(c) or damages (including reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs
and the benefit of the bargain lost by the stockholders of the Company, taking
into consideration relevant matters); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) to the
extent the Company is enforcing or seeking to

 



-68-   enforce any rights on behalf of the stockholders of the Company, such rights
may only be enforced and sought by the Company in its sole and absolute
discretion and (b) nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Parent from
contesting any such claims for equitable remedies or damages. Following the
Effective Time, the provisions of Article IV hereof shall be enforceable by
any one or more of the stockholders of the Company to the extent necessary to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration to which each such stockholder of
the Company is entitled pursuant to Article IV.

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

9.10. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in
the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

 

9.11. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

9.12. _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and
headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part
of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of
the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a
Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation."

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(c) Each party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in its
respective disclosure schedule in a section of such disclosure schedule

 



-69-   that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The
fact that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure schedule to
this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is
required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

9.13. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, subject
to prior written consent of the Company, another wholly owned direct or
indirect subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in
which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to
such other subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made
herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall
be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to such other
subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such
designation shall not materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impede
the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 

9.14. _Parent Guarantee_.

(a) Parent Holdco irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Company
the due and punctual performance of the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
hereunder (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ ") subject to the conditions
hereunder. If, for any reason whatsoever, Parent or Merger Sub shall fail or
be unable to duly, punctually and fully pay or perform the Guaranteed
Obligations, Parent Holdco will forthwith pay and cause to be paid in lawful
currency of the United States, or perform or cause to be performed, the
Guaranteed Obligations. Parent Holdco hereby waives diligence, presentment,
demand of payment, filing objections with a court, any right to
require proceeding first against Parent or Merger Sub, any right to require
the prior disposition of the assets of Parent or Merger Sub to meet their
respective obligations, notice, protest and all demands whatsoever.

 

(b) Parent Holdco is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Parent
Holdco has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all
corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Parent Holdco and is a valid and binding agreement of Parent
Holdco, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. Parent Holdco hereby makes the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.2(d) with respect to
itself. Parent Holdco owns one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Parent Holdco.

 



-70-  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the

above.
