ARTICLE  II

 

 

_Effect  of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_

 

_Constituent  Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

 

 

SECTION  2.01. _Effect  on Capital Stock._   At the  Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  the holder of
any shares of FPL Group Common Stock, any shares of Constellation  Common
Stock or any shares of common stock of Merger Sub:

 

 

(a)  _Cancellation  of Certain FPL Group Common Stock._   Each  share of
FPL Group Common Stock that is owned by FPL Group or Constellation  shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and  no 
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(b)  _Conversion  of FPL Group Common Stock._   Each  issued and
outstanding share of FPL Group Common Stock (other than shares to  be 
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(a)) shall be automatically 
converted, subject to the prior effectiveness of the Stock Split, into the 
right  to receive one fully paid and nonassessable share of Constellation
Common Stock  (the " _Exchange  Ratio_ ").  As of  the Effective Time, all
such shares of FPL Group Common Stock shall no longer  be  outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease  to  exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of FPL  Group
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except  the
right to receive the shares of Constellation Common Stock to be issued  or 
paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in 
accordance with Section 2.02(b), and the right to receive dividends and 
other distributions in accordance with Section 2.02(c), in each case, 
without interest.

 

 

(c)  _Conversion  of Merger Sub Common Stock._   Each  issued and
outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be  automatically
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share  of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

SECTION  2.02. _Exchange  of Certificates._   (a)  _Exchange  Agent._  
As of  the Effective Time, Constellation shall enter into an agreement with
such bank  or trust company as may be mutually agreed to by FPL Group and
Constellation  (the " _Exchange _

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

_Agent_ "),  which  agreement shall provide that Constellation shall deposit
with the Exchange  Agent  as of the Effective Time, in trust for the benefit
of the holders of  Certificates, certificates representing the shares of
Constellation Common  Stock  (such shares of Constellation Common Stock
being hereinafter referred to  as the " _Merger  Consideration_ ",  and 
together with any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto with 
a  record date after the Effective Time, collectively being hereinafter
referred  to  as the " _Exchange  Fund_ ")  issuable pursuant to Section
2.01(b) in exchange for the shares of FPL  Group Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  _Exchange  Procedures._   As soon  as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall  mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates that immediately  prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of FPL Group Common  Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ")  whose  shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration  pursuant to Section 2.01(b), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall  specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the  Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange  Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as FPL Group  and  Constellation may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in  surrendering the Certificates in exchange
for the Merger Consideration. Upon  surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together  with  such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may  reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate  shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing  that
number of whole shares of Constellation Common Stock that such holder  has 
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and 
certain dividends or other distributions in accordance with  Section 2.02(c),
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be  cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of FPL Group Common Stock  that is not
registered in the transfer records of FPL Group, a certificate  representing
the proper number of shares of Constellation Common Stock may  be  issued to
a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so  surrendered
is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or  otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such issuance  shall
pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of  shares
of Constellation Common Stock to a person other than the registered  holder
of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Constellation  that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as 
contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any 
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such  surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the
right to  receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to the provisions
of this  Article II and certain dividends or other distributions in
accordance with  Section 2.02(c). No interest shall be paid or will accrue on
the Merger  Consideration or any cash payable to holders of Certificates
pursuant to the  provisions of this Article II.

 

 

(c)  _Distributions  with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._   No  dividends
or other distributions with respect to Constellation Common Stock  with  a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any 
unsurrendered Certificate

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

with  respect to the shares of Constellation Common Stock issuable hereunder
in  respect thereof, and all such dividends and other distributions shall
be  paid by  Constellation to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in
the Exchange  Fund,  in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this  Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat
or similar Laws,  following surrender of any such Certificate to the Exchange
Agent for  cancellation there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing  whole shares of Constellation Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without  interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender,
the amount of  dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time  theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Constellation Common  Stock  and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other  distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such  surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with  respect to such whole shares of
Constellation Common Stock.

 

 

 

(d)  _No  Further Ownership Rights in FPL Group Common Stock._   All 
shares of Constellation Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange 
of  Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II (and any 
dividends or other distributions, in each case, pursuant to this  Article II)
shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full  satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of FPL Group Common Stock  theretofore
represented by such Certificates, _subject_ ,  _however_ ,  to FPL  Group's
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions  expressly
permitted by the terms of this Agreement with a record date prior  to  the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by FPL Group on such 
shares of FPL Group Common Stock that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, 
and  there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books  of FPL Group of the shares of FPL Group Common Stock that
were outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time,  Certificates are presented to Constellation or the Exchange
Agent for any  reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this  Article II, except as otherwise provided by Law.

 

 

(e)  _Termination  of Exchange Fund._   Any  portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of the  Certificates for 12 months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to  Constellation, upon demand,
and any holders of the Certificates who have not  theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to  Constellation for payment of
their claim for Merger Consideration, any dividends  or other distributions
with respect to Constellation Common Stock.

 

 

(f)  _No  Liability._   None of  Constellation, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent or any of their  respective directors, officers,
employees and agents shall be liable to any  person in respect of any shares
of Constellation Common Stock, any dividends  or  other distributions with
respect thereto, in each case delivered to a public  official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar  Law.  If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after  the  Effective
Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger 
Consideration or any dividends or other distributions payable to the holder 
of  such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any  Governmental Authority), any such

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Merger  Consideration, dividends or other distributions in respect of such
Certificate  shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of  Constellation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously  entitled thereto.

 

 

 

(g)  _Investment  of Exchange Fund._   The  Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed  by Constellation, on a
daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting  from  such investments
shall be paid to Constellation.

 

 

(h)  _Lost  Certificates._   If any  Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an  affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Constellation or the Exchange Agent,  the  posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Constellation  or  the
Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made 
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue 
in  exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger 
Consideration and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends and distributions on 
shares of Constellation Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, in each 
case pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

(i)  _Withholding  Taxes._   Each of  the parties and the Exchange Agent
will be entitled to deduct and withhold  from  amounts otherwise payable
under this Article II any amounts that it is  required to deduct and withhold
with respect to such payments under any  provision of Tax Law. Any amounts so
deducted and withheld will be treated  for  all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the person in respect  of  which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 

 

 

ARTICLE  III

 

 

_Representations  and Warranties_

 

 

SECTION  3.01. _Representations  and Warranties of Constellation and Merger
Sub._   Except  (i) to the extent the qualifying nature of such disclosure
is apparent  therefrom, as set forth in the Constellation SEC Reports filed
by Constellation  with, or furnished by Constellation to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission  (the " _SEC_ ")  at any  time on or after January 1,
2004 through the date of this Agreement and publicly  available prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " _Filed  Constellation SEC Reports_ "), 
other  than risk factor disclosure contained in any such Filed Constellation
SEC Report  under the headings "Risk Factors", "Forward Looking Statements"
or any similar  sections and any disclosure of risks that are predictive or
forward looking  in  nature (provided that nothing in the Filed
Constellation SEC Reports shall  be  deemed to qualify, or be deemed to have
been disclosed for the purposes of,  Section 3.01(b) or 3.01(c)), or (ii) as
set forth in the letter dated the date  of this Agreement delivered to FPL
Group by Constellation concurrently with  the  execution and delivery of
this Agreement (the " _Constellation  Disclosure Letter_ ")  (with 
specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement 
to  which the information set forth in such letter relates; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  any information set forth in one section of the
Constellation

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Disclosure  Letter shall be deemed to apply to each other section or
subsection thereof  to  the extent that it is apparent on the face of the
applicable disclosure that  such information is applicable to such other
section or subsection without  reference to any underlying documentation),
Constellation and Merger Sub  represent and warrant to FPL Group as follows:

 

 

 

(a)  _Organization  and Qualification._   (i) Each  of Constellation and
its subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, is duly organized,  validly existing
and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that  recognize the
concept of good standing) under the Laws of its jurisdiction  of 
organization and has full power and authority to conduct its business as and 
to  the extent now conducted and to own, use and lease its assets and
properties,  except for such failures to be so organized, existing and in
good standing  (with  respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of
good standing) or to  have  such power and authority that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had  and would not reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on  Constellation. Each of Constellation and its
subsidiaries, including Merger  Sub,  is duly qualified, licensed or
admitted to do business and is in good standing  (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good  standing) in each
jurisdiction in which the ownership, use or leasing of  its assets and
properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes  such 
qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except for such failures to 
be  so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing (with respect
to  jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) that, 
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be 
expected to have a material adverse effect on Constellation.  Section 3.01(a)
of the Constellation Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the  date of this
Agreement the name and jurisdiction of organization of each  material
subsidiary of Constellation.

 

 

(ii)  Section 3.01(a) of the Constellation Disclosure Letter sets forth a 
description as of the date of this Agreement of all Constellation Joint 
Ventures, including (A) the name of the project associated with each such 
Constellation Joint Venture and (B) a brief description of the principal 
line or lines of business conducted by each such entity. For purposes of
this  Agreement:

 

 

(A)  " _Joint  Venture_ " of  a  person shall mean any person that is
not a subsidiary of such first person,  in  which such first person or one
or more of its subsidiaries owns directly or  indirectly any share, capital
stock, partnership, membership or similar interest  of any person or any
Option therefor (together, " _Equity  Interests_ "),  other  than Equity
Interests that represent less than 5% of each class of the  outstanding
voting securities or other Equity Interests of such second person;  and

 

 

(B)  " _Constellation  Joint Venture_ " shall  mean any Joint Venture of
Constellation or any of its subsidiaries in which  the  invested capital
associated with Constellation=s  or its  subsidiaries=  interest  exceeds
$100,000,000, as reasonably determined by Constellation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii)  Except  for interests in the subsidiaries of Constellation, the
Constellation Joint  Ventures and interests acquired after the date of this
Agreement without  violating any covenant contained herein, Constellation
does not directly or  indirectly own any shares of capital stock, other
voting securities or Equity  Interests in any person, in which the invested
capital associated with such  interest individually as of the date of this
Agreement exceeds $100,000,000,  as  reasonably determined by Constellation.
Merger Sub (A) does not directly or  indirectly own any shares of capital
stock, other voting securities or Equity  Interests in any person and (B)
does not hold and has not held any material  assets or incurred any material
liabilities.

Constellation or its subsidiaries or any of the Constellation Joint 
Ventures, as applicable (collectively, the " _Constellation  Nuclear

applicable Laws and Permits,  except for such failures to comply that,
individually or in the aggregate,  have  not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a material

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

adverse  effect on Constellation. Each of the Constellation Nuclear
Facilities maintains,  and is in material compliance with, emergency plans
designed to respond to  an  unplanned Release therefrom of radioactive
materials and each such plan conforms  with the requirements of applicable
Law in all material respects. The plans  for  the decommissioning of each of

fuel conform with the requirements of applicable  Law in  all material
respects and, solely with respect to the portion of the  Constellation
Nuclear Facilities owned, directly or indirectly, by  Constellation, the
funding of decommissioning and storage of spent nuclear  fuel  is consistent

information from the NRC or any other agency with jurisdiction  over  such
facility, except for such notices or requests for information that, 
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be 
expected to have a material adverse effect on Constellation. Constellation 
and  its subsidiaries and each of the Constellation Joint Ventures maintain
liability  insurance to the full extent required by Law for operating the
Constellation  Nuclear Facilities, and such insurance regarding such
facilities remains  in full  force and effect in all material respects.

insurance that, individually or  in  the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a  material adverse effect on
Constellation, from January 1, 2004, through the  date of this Agreement,
each of Constellation and its subsidiaries has been  continuously insured
with financially responsible insurers or has self-insured,  in each case in
such amounts and with respect to such risks and losses as are  customary for
companies in the United States conducting the business conducted  by
Constellation and its subsidiaries during such time period. Neither 
Constellation nor any of its subsidiaries has received any notice of 
cancellation or termination with respect to any insurance policy of 
Constellation or any of its subsidiaries, except with respect to any 
cancellation or termination that, individually or in the aggregate, has not 
had  and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on  Constellation.

Trading Guidelines_ "),  and  Constellation's Board of Directors has
approved a VaR limit as set forth in  Section 3.01(q) of the Constellation
Disclosure Letter (the " _Constellation  Approved VaR Limit_ ").  Compliance

President and Chief Risk Officer of Constellation and is periodically 
reviewed with the audit committee of the Board of Directors of
Constellation.  Constellation has provided the Constellation Trading
Guidelines to FPL Group  prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date
of this Agreement, (i)  Constellation's VaR is in compliance with the
Constellation Approved VaR Limit,  and Constellation and its subsidiaries are
operating in compliance with the  Constellation Trading Guidelines in all
material respects and (ii) the aggregate  net positions in the trading
portfolio of Constellation and its subsidiaries  would not reasonably be
expected to result in a material loss to Constellation  and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, based on market prices in existence  as  of the date of
this Agreement. From September 30,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2005,  to  the date of this Agreement, neither Constellation nor any of its
subsidiaries  has, in accordance with its mark-to-market accounting policies,
experienced  an  aggregate net loss in the trading portfolio of
Constellation and its  subsidiaries that would be material to Constellation
and its subsidiaries  taken  as a whole. For purposes of this Section
3.01(q) and Section 4.01(h), " _VaR_ " shall  mean the value-at-risk of the
mark-to-market portfolio of Constellation and  its  marketing and trading
subsidiaries based on a four standard deviation move  in  prices and a one-
day holding period.

warranty of FPL Group contained in  Section 3.02(s), (i) the affirmative vote
(the " _Constellation  Stockholder Approval_ ")  of  (A) at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of Constellation Common  Stock entitled to
be cast at the Constellation Stockholders Meeting is the  only  vote of the
holders of any class or series of the capital stock of Constellation  or its
subsidiaries required to effect the Constellation Charter Amendment  whereby,
among other things, (1) the number of authorized shares of  Constellation
Common Stock will be increased and (2) the Constellation  Common Stock shall
be divided (the " _Stock  Split_ ")  such  that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each issued and outstanding  share  of Constellation Common
Stock shall be automatically converted into (assuming  the effectiveness of
the Merger) 1.444 (the " _Split  Ratio_ ")  fully  paid and nonassessable
shares of Constellation Common Stock (with the resulting  number of shares
held by each registered holder of Constellation Common Stock  being rounded
down to the nearest whole number and with each such registered  holder being
entitled to receive from Constellation in lieu of any fractional  shares of
Constellation Common Stock prior to such rounding down an amount  in  cash
(without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying  (x) the
fraction of a share of Constellation Common Stock to which such  holder
(after taking into account all shares of Constellation Common Stock  and 
all certificates held immediately prior to the effective time of the Stock 
Split  by such holder) would otherwise be entitled to and (y) the closing
price  per share of Constellation Common Stock as reported on the NYSE
Composite  Transaction Tape (as reported in _The  Wall Street Journal_ ,

been paid  or  is being contested in good faith in appropriate proceedings),
and no requests  for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are
pending.

 

 

(iii)  The  Federal income Tax Returns of the FPL Group Taxpayers have been

Benefit Agreement  that is a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan subject
to Section 409A of  the  Code has been operated in compliance with Section

other subsequent event), and no event  or condition exists or has existed
that could reasonably be expected to result  in the incurrence of any such
liability by FPL Group, any subsidiary or any  FPL  Group ERISA Affiliate.
No such FPL Group Employee Benefit Plan that is subject  to Section 412 of
the Code or Title IV of ERISA has been completely or partially  terminated or

(m)  _Labor  and Employee Matters._   Neither  FPL Group nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining  agreement or other
labor agreement with any union or labor organization. As  of  the date of
this Agreement, there are no disputes pending or, to the knowledge  of FPL
Group, threatened between FPL Group or any of its subsidiaries, on the  one
hand, and any trade union or other representative of their respective 
employees, on the other hand, and there is no charge or complaint pending or 
threatened in writing against FPL Group or any of its subsidiaries before
the  NLRB, the EEOC or any other Governmental Authority responsible for
enforcing  labor employment Laws except in each case as, individually or in
the aggregate,  have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse  effect on FPL Group, and, to the knowledge of FPL Group, as
of the date of  this  Agreement, there are no organizational efforts
presently being made involving  any of the employees of FPL Group or any of
its subsidiaries. From  January 1, 2002, to the date of this Agreement, there
has been no work  stoppage, strike or other concerted action by employees of

no such action has been  threatened in writing, except in each case as,

expected to have a material adverse  effect on FPL Group. Since January 1,
2000, neither FPL Group nor any  of its subsidiaries has engaged in any
"plant closing" or "mass layoff", as  defined in WARN, without complying with
the notice requirements of such Laws,  except for such failures to comply
with the notice requirements of such Laws  that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably  be  expected to have a
material adverse effect on FPL Group. With respect to the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each labor notice required to  have  been
given under any Law or collective bargaining agreement has been given  or 
satisfied, other than as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably  be expected to have a material adverse effect on FPL Group.

(i)  Each  of FPL Group, its subsidiaries and the FPL Group Joint Ventures
has been and  is  in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws.

 

 

(ii)  Each  of FPL Group, its subsidiaries and the FPL Group Joint Ventures
has obtained  all  Environmental Permits necessary for the construction of
their

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

facilities  and the conduct of their operations as of the date of this
Agreement, as  applicable, and all such Environmental Permits are in good
standing or, where  applicable, a renewal application has been timely filed
and is pending agency  approval. FPL Group, its subsidiaries and the FPL
Group Joint Ventures are  in  compliance with all terms and conditions of
such Environmental Permits, and  no  such Environmental Permits will be
revoked, modified or not renewed as a  result  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

 

(iii)  There is no Environmental Claim pending or, to the knowledge of FPL
Group,  threatened:

 

 

(A)  against FPL Group or any of its subsidiaries or any of the FPL Group
Joint  Ventures;

 

 

  (B) against any person or entity whose liability for such Environmental
Claim  has been retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of
Law by  FPL  Group or any of its subsidiaries or any of the FPL Group Joint
Ventures;  or

 

 

  (C) against any real or personal property or operations that FPL Group or
any  of  its subsidiaries or any of the FPL Group Joint Ventures owns,
leases or operates  in whole or in part, or, to the knowledge of FPL Group,
formerly owned, leased  or operated, in whole or in part.

 

 

(iv)  There have not been any Releases of any Hazardous Material that would
reasonably  be expected to form the basis of any Environmental Claim against
FPL Group  or  any of its subsidiaries or any of the FPL Group Joint
Ventures.

 

 

(o)  _Operations  of Nuclear Power Plants._   The  operations of the
nuclear generation stations owned or operated, in whole or  part, by FPL
Group or its subsidiaries or any of the FPL Group Joint Ventures,  as
applicable (collectively, the " _FPL  Group Nuclear Facilities_ ")  are 
and have been conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws and Permits, 
except for such failures to comply that, individually or in the aggregate, 
have  not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect  on FPL Group. Each of the FPL Group Nuclear Facilities maintains, and
is in  material compliance with, emergency plans designed to respond to an
unplanned  Release therefrom of radioactive materials and each such plan
conforms with  the  requirements of applicable Law in all material respects.
The plans for the  decommissioning of each of the FPL Group Nuclear
Facilities and for the storage  of spent nuclear fuel conform with the
requirements of applicable Law in all  material respects and, solely with
respect to the portion of the FPL Group  Nuclear Facilities owned, directly
of indirectly, by FPL Group, the funding  of  decommissioning and storage of
spent nuclear fuel is consistent with applicable  Law. The operations of the
FPL Group Nuclear Facilities are not the subject  of  any outstanding
notices of violation or requests for information from the NRC  or  any other
agency with jurisdiction over such facility, except for such notices  or
requests for information that,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

individually  or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to  have a  material adverse effect on FPL Group. FPL Group and its
subsidiaries and  each of  the FPL Group Joint Ventures maintain liability
insurance to the full extent  required by Law for operating the FPL Group
Nuclear Facilities, and such  insurance regarding such facilities remains in
full force and effect in all  material respects.

 

 

 

(p)  _Insurance._   Except  for failures to maintain insurance or self-
insurance that, individually or  in  the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a  material adverse effect on FPL Group,
from January 1, 2004, through the  date of this Agreement, each of FPL Group
and its subsidiaries has been  continuously insured with financially
responsible insurers or has self-insured,  in each case in such amounts and
with respect to such risks and losses as are  customary for companies in the
United States conducting the business conducted  by FPL Group and its
subsidiaries during such time period. Neither FPL Group  nor  any of its
subsidiaries has received any notice of cancellation or termination  with
respect to any insurance policy of FPL Group or any of its subsidiaries, 
except with respect to any cancellation or termination that, individually or 
in  the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a  material adverse effect on FPL Group.

 

 

(q)  _Trading._   FPL  Group has established risk parameters, limits and
guidelines in compliance  with  the risk management policies approved by the
Finance and Investment Committee  of  the Board of Directors of FPL Group
(the " _FPL  Group Trading Guidelines_ ")  and  the Chief Executive Officer
of FPL Group has approved a VaR limit as set forth  in Section 3.02(q) of the
FPL Group Disclosure Letter (the " _FPL  Group Approved VaR Limit_ "). 
Compliance with the FPL Group Trading Guidelines is monitored by the
Exposure  Management Committee of FPL Group and reported to the Chief
Executive Officer  of  FPL Group and is reviewed annually with the Finance
and Investment Committee  of  the Board of Directors of FPL Group. FPL Group
has provided the FPL Group  Trading Guidelines to Constellation prior to the
date of this Agreement. As  of  the date of this Agreement, (i) FPL Group's
VaR is in compliance with the FPL  Group Approved VaR Limit, and FPL Group
and its subsidiaries are operating  in  compliance with the FPL Group
Trading Guidelines in all material respects and  (ii) the aggregate net
positions in the trading and managed hedge portfolio  ( _i.e._ ,  mark-to-
market positions excluding non-qualifying hedges) of FPL Group and  its 
subsidiaries would not reasonably be expected to result in a material loss 
to  FPL Group and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, based on market prices
in  existence as of the date of this Agreement. From September 30, 2005, to
the  date of this Agreement, neither FPL Group nor any of its subsidiaries
has,  in  accordance with its mark-to-market accounting policies,

Permits or  agreements in the ordinary course of business consistent with

not solicited by it and that did not otherwise result from  a  breach of
this Section 4.03(a) is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a 
Constellation Superior Proposal, and (y) that the failure to take any of the 
actions described in clauses (A) or (B) below with respect to any such 
Constellation Takeover Proposal would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach  of the fiduciary obligations of the Board of Directors of
Constellation to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  stockholders of Constellation under applicable Law, then Constellation

expressly  that  (1) it has received a Constellation Takeover Proposal and
(2) Constellation's  Board of Directors has made the determination set forth
in clauses (x) and  (y)  above with respect to such Constellation Takeover
Proposal and (ii) also  contain such additional information as required by
Section 4.03(c), if not  already provided pursuant to such section (such
notice, the " _Constellation  Information Notice_ ")  and  subject to its
continuing compliance with Section 4.03(c), Constellation  may (A) furnish
information with respect to Constellation and its  subsidiaries to the person
making such Constellation Takeover Proposal (and  its  representatives)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality and standstill  agreement containing
terms no less favorable to Constellation than those  set  forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement (the " _Confidentiality  Agreement_ ")  dated 
September 6, 2005, between Constellation and FPL Group ( _provided_   that 
such confidentiality agreement shall not in any way restrict Constellation 
from  complying with its disclosure obligations under this Agreement,
including  with  respect to such proposal; _provided_ _further_ ,  that
to  the extent permitted by Law Constellation will provide to FPL Group
copies  of  all written confidential information regarding the businesses of
Constellation  and its subsidiaries provided by Constellation to the person
making such  Constellation Takeover Proposal promptly following delivery
thereof to such  person unless such information has previously been provided
to FPL Group,  in  which case Constellation shall only be obligated to
promptly provide to FPL  Group a list of such information provided by
Constellation to such person)  and  (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such Constellation  Takeover Proposal.

 

 

 

For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Constellation  Takeover Proposal_

subsidiaries,  taken as a whole (a " _Constellation  Material Business_
"),  (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 10% or more of
any  class of voting securities of Constellation or any subsidiary of
Constellation  owning, operating or controlling a Constellation Material
Business (a " _Constellation  Material Business Subsidiary_ "),  (iii) any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result  in any
person beneficially owning 10% or more of any class of voting securities  of
Constellation or any Constellation Material Business Subsidiary or  (iv) any
merger (including any triangular merger), consolidation, business 
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction  involving Constellation or any Constellation Material Business
Subsidiary as  a  result of which a third party or the stockholders of a
third party would acquire  10% or more of the voting securities of
Constellation or such Constellation  Material Business Subsidiary, in each
case other than the transactions,  including divestitures, contemplated by
this Agreement or transactions solely  among wholly owned subsidiaries of
Constellation.

 

 

(b) Except  as contemplated by this Section 4.03, neither the Board of
Directors of  Constellation nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) recommend
the  approval or adoption of any Constellation Takeover Proposal, (B)
withdraw  or modify, in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  manner  adverse to FPL Group, the recommendation by such Board of
Directors or such  committee of the Constellation Charter Amendment, the
Share Issuance or any  other transaction contemplated hereby, (C) recommend
that the stockholders  of Constellation reject the Constellation Charter
Amendment or the Share  Issuance or (D) resolve, agree or propose publicly to
take any of the  actions set forth in clauses (A) through (C) above (each
such action set  forth in this Section 4.03(b)(i) being referred to herein as
a " _Constellation  Adverse Recommendation Change_ "),  (ii) approve or
adopt, or resolve, agree or propose publicly to approve or  adopt, any
Constellation Takeover Proposal, (iii) withdraw or modify, or  resolve, agree
or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse  to  FPL
Group, the approval or adoption by such Board of Directors or such committee 
of this Agreement, the Constellation Charter Amendment, the Share Issuance, 
the  Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) determine
that  the  Constellation Charter Amendment or the Share Issuance is no
longer advisable  to  the extent such determination is necessary in order to
validly submit the  Charter Amendment or the Share Issuance to Constellation
stockholders at  the  Constellation Stockholders Meeting or (v) cause or
permit Constellation to  enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement,  joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or any other agreement (each,  a " _Constellation  Acquisition
Agreement_ ")  related to any Constellation Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality  and  standstill agreement referred to in, and in accordance
with,  Section 4.03(a)), or resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any
such  actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Constellation
Applicable  Period, the Board of Directors of Constellation may make a
Constellation  Adverse  Recommendation Change, if (x) it determines in good
faith, after consulting  with  outside counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably  likely  to result in a breach of the
fiduciary obligations of the Board of Directors  of  Constellation to the
stockholders of Constellation under applicable Law and  (y)  the Board of
Directors of Constellation has provided to FPL Group seven business  days
prior written notice of its intent to effect a Constellation Adverse 
Recommendation Change (which notice shall include the reasonable details 
regarding the cause for, and nature of, the Constellation Adverse
Recommendation  Change) and, if requested by FPL Group, negotiated in good
faith with FPL  Group  during such seven business day period regarding
revisions to this Agreement  that  would avoid such Constellation Adverse
Recommendation Change; _provided_   that, if  there are less than seven
business days remaining in the Constellation  Applicable Period, references
to "seven business days" in this clause (y) shall  be deemed to be the number
of business days, if any, remaining in the  Constellation Applicable Period.

 

 

 

Notwithstanding  any Constellation Adverse Recommendation Change,
Constellation shall  nevertheless submit the Constellation Charter Amendment
and the Share Issuance  to the stockholders of Constellation for the purpose
of obtaining the  Constellation Stockholder Approval at the Constellation
Stockholders Meeting  and  nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
relieve Constellation of such  obligation, unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated in accordance  with  its terms prior to the Constellation
Stockholders Meeting.

 

 

For  purposes of this Agreement, a " _Constellation  Superior Proposal_
" means  any written Constellation Takeover Proposal that the Board of
Directors of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Constellation  determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial
advisor of  nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to
Constellation's  stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement after taking into account, among other
things:

 

 

 

(i)  all  financial considerations and financial aspects of such
Constellation Takeover  Proposal and the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby,

 

 

(ii)  all  strategic considerations, including whether such Constellation
Takeover Proposal  is more favorable from a long-term strategic standpoint,

 

 

(iii)  all  legal and regulatory considerations of such Constellation
Takeover Proposal  and  the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby,

 

 

(iv)  the  identity of the third party making such Constellation Takeover 
Proposal,

 

 

(v)  the  conditions and likelihood of completion of such Constellation
Takeover Proposal  as compared to the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby (taking  into account any necessary regulatory
approvals),

 

 

(vi)  whether such Constellation Takeover Proposal is likely to impose
material  obligations on Constellation (or the post-closing entity in which
Constellation  stockholders will hold securities) in connection with
obtaining necessary  regulatory approvals,

 

 

(vii)  whether such Constellation Takeover Proposal is subject to a financing
condition  and the likelihood of such Constellation Takeover Proposal being
financed,  and 

 

 

(viii)  the payment of any Constellation Termination Fee, if relevant,

 

 

_provided_   that in  the definition of "Constellation Takeover Proposal" in
Section 4.03(a) (x) all  of the references to "10%" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%," (y) the  reference to "or any subsidiary of
Constellation owning, operating or  controlling a Constellation Material
Business" shall be deemed to be deleted and  (z) all of the references to
"Constellation Material Business Subsidiary" shall  be deemed to be deleted.

 

 

(c)  In  addition to the obligations of Constellation set forth in
paragraphs (a)  and (b) of this Section 4.03, to the extent permitted by Law
Constellation  shall provide prompt written notice to FPL Group of (i) any
request for  information by any person who has made or who the Board of
Directors or any  senior executive officer of Constellation in good faith
believes is reasonably  likely to make a Constellation Takeover Proposal or
(ii) any Constellation  Takeover Proposal, in either case within

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24 hours  of such request for information or the receipt of such
Constellation Takeover  Proposal, which notice shall specify the principal
terms and conditions of  such  request or Constellation Takeover Proposal
and the identity of the person  making  such request or Constellation
Takeover Proposal, and Constellation shall  keep  FPL Group promptly
informed of the status and details (including amendments  or  proposed
amendments, other than as to non-substantive or immaterial matters)  of  any
such request or Constellation Takeover Proposal.

 

 

 

(d)  Nothing contained in this Section 4.03 shall prohibit or restrict 
Constellation from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position 
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from 
making any disclosure to Constellation's stockholders if, in the good faith 
judgment of the Board of Directors of Constellation, after consultation with 
outside counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its 
obligations under applicable Law or (ii) taking actions permitted by  Section
4.01(f).

 

 

SECTION  4.04. _No  Solicitation by FPL Group._   (a) FPL Group, its
subsidiaries and their respective representatives  immediately shall cease
and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions  or negotiations
existing as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any  FPL Group
Takeover Proposal. FPL Group shall not, nor shall it authorize or  permit any
of its subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any  director,

accountant or other advisor, agent or representative of FPL Group or any of 
its  subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or

participate in any  negotiations or substantive discussions regarding, or
furnish to any person  any  information with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, any FPL  Group Takeover Proposal; _provided_ ,

Shareholder Approval (the  " _FPL  Group Applicable Period_ "),  the 
Board of Directors of FPL Group determines in good faith, after consultation 
with its legal and financial advisors, that (x) a FPL Group Takeover 
Proposal that was not solicited by it and that did not otherwise result from 
a  breach of this Section 4.04(a) is, or is reasonably likely to result in,
a  FPL Group Superior Proposal, and (y) that the failure to take any of the 
actions described in clauses (A) or (B) below with respect to any such FPL 
Group Takeover Proposal would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of 
the  fiduciary obligations of the Board of Directors of FPL Group to the
shareholders  of FPL Group under applicable Law, then FPL Group shall
promptly (but in any  event within 24 hours following the time of such
determination and prior to  taking the actions set forth in clauses (A) and
(B) below) provide to  Constellation written notice that shall (i) state
expressly that (1) it has  received a FPL Group Takeover Proposal and (2) FPL
Group's Board of Directors  has made the determination set forth in clauses
(x) and (y) above with  respect to such FPL Group Takeover Proposal and (ii)
also contain such  additional information as required by Section 4.04(c), if

with  respect to such proposal; _provided_ _further_ ,  that to  the extent
permitted by Law FPL Group will provide to Constellation copies  of  all
written confidential information regarding the businesses of FPL Group  and

nevertheless submit  this Agreement to the shareholders of FPL Group for the
purpose of obtaining  the  FPL Group Shareholder Approval at the FPL Group
Shareholders Meeting and nothing  contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
FPL Group of such obligation, unless  this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with its terms prior  to  the FPL Group
Shareholders Meeting.

 

 

For  purposes of this Agreement, a " _FPL  Group Superior Proposal_
" means  any written FPL Group Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors
of FPL  Group  determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial

obligations on FPL Group (or the post-closing entity in which FPL Group 
shareholders will hold securities) in connection with obtaining necessary 
regulatory approvals,

 

 

(vii)  whether such FPL Group Takeover Proposal is subject to a financing
condition  and  the likelihood of such FPL Group Takeover Proposal being
financed,  and

 

 

(viii)  the payment of any FPL Group Termination Fee, if relevant,

 

 

_provided_   that in  the definition of "FPL Group Takeover Proposal" in
Section 4.04(a) (x) all  references to "10%" shall be deemed to be references
to "50%", (y) the  reference to "or any subsidiary of FPL Group owning,
operating or controlling a  FPL Group Material Business" shall be deemed to
be deleted and (z) all the  references to "FPL Group Material Business
Subsidiary" shall be deemed to be  deleted.

shall  provide prompt written notice to Constellation of (i) any request
for  information by any person who has made or who the Board of Directors or
any  senior executive officer of FPL Group in good faith believes is
reasonably  likely to make a FPL Group Takeover Proposal or (ii) any FPL
Group Takeover  Proposal, in either case within 24 hours of such request for
information or  the receipt of such FPL Group Takeover Proposal, which notice
shall specify  the  principal terms and conditions of such request or FPL

or FPL Group Takeover  Proposal and FPL Group shall keep Constellation

proposed amendments, other than as to  non-substantive or immaterial matters)
of any such request or FPL Group Takeover  Proposal.

 

 

(d)  Nothing contained in this Section 4.04 shall prohibit or restrict FPL
Group  from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated  by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any  disclosure to FPL Group's shareholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the  Board of Directors of FPL Group, after consultation with
outside counsel,  failure so to disclose would be

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 

 

inconsistent  with its obligations under applicable Law or (ii) taking
actions permitted  by Section 4.02(f).

 

 

 

SECTION  4.05. _Other  Actions._   Constellation, Merger Sub and FPL Group
shall not, and shall not permit any  of  their respective subsidiaries to,

the extent such inaccuracy, either  alone or together with other
inaccuracies, would reasonably be expected to  result in a failure of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.02(a) or  6.03(a), as applicable, or (y)
material breach by such person of any  covenant.

 

 

SECTION  4.06. _Coordination  of Dividends._   From the  date of this

intention of Constellation and FPL Group that no holder of Constellation 
Common Stock or FPL Group Common Stock shall receive two dividends, or fail 
to  receive one dividend, for any single calendar quarter with respect to its
shares  of Constellation Common Stock or FPL Group Common Stock, as the case
may be,  and/or any shares of Constellation Common Stock any such holder
receives in  exchange therefor pursuant to the Merger.

FPL  Group's independent accountants, one dated a date within two business
days  before the date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective and one

SECTION  5.04. _Access  to Information; Confidentiality; Effect of Review._
(a)  _Access._   Subject  to the Confidentiality Agreement, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law  each  of FPL Group and Constellation shall, and
shall cause each of its respective  subsidiaries to, afford to the other
party, and to the officers, employees,  accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives of such  other  party, pursuant to
integration policies to be adopted by the integration leaders  designated by
each of Constellation and FPL Group, reasonable access during  normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all  their 
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records 
and,  during such period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of
FPL  Group  and Constellation shall, and shall cause each of its respective
subsidiaries  to,  (i) confer on a regular and reasonable basis with one or
more  representatives of the other party to discuss material operational
and  regulatory matters and the general status of its ongoing operations for
purposes  related to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  (including, without limitation, a party's assessment of the proper
accounting  for such transactions, any public disclosures that a party is
required to make  regarding such transactions and reasonable access to
management and systems  needed for integration planning) or the fulfillment
of its obligations under  this Agreement, (ii) advise the other party of any
change or event that has  had  or would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on such party  and (iii) furnish promptly all other
information concerning its business,  properties and personnel, in each case
as such other party may reasonably  request in connection with activities
relating to the completion of the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the fulfillment of its  obligations under this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  (A) no actions shall be taken pursuant to
this Section 5.04(a) that (x)  would result in a waiver of the
attorney/client privilege or (y) could  reasonably be expected to result in
violation of applicable Law, including  antitrust Laws, and (B) each of the
parties shall, without being deemed to  have violated this Section 5.04, be
permitted to continue to limit the other  party's access to its wholesale
competitive supply business, retail competitive  supply business and wind

of competitive considerations. Subject to the  Confidentiality Agreement, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, each  of  FPL Group and
Constellation, so long as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consistent  with its confidentiality obligations under its applicable
agreements, shall  use  its reasonable best efforts to cause each FPL Group
Joint Venture and each  Constellation Joint Venture, respectively, to afford
access and take such  other  actions as would be required under the previous
sentence as if it was a  subsidiary of FPL Group or Constellation, as the
case may be. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, if a party requests access to
proprietary information of the  other party, the disclosure of which could
reasonably be expected to materially  impair the competitive position or
operations of the other party if the Closing  were not to occur (giving
effect to the requesting party's obligations under the  Confidentiality
Agreement), such information shall only be disclosed to the  extent
reasonably agreed upon by the chief financial officers (or their  designees)
of FPL Group and Constellation. Section 5.04(a) of each of the  Constellation
Disclosure Letter and the FPL Group Disclosure Letter sets  forth 
additional procedures regarding access to information. All information
exchanged  pursuant to this Section 5.04(a) shall be subject to the
Confidentiality  Agreement.

 

 

 

(b)  _Effect  of Review._   No  review pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall

representation or warranty given by any  of  the parties hereto to any of
the other parties hereto.

 

 

SECTION  5.05. _Regulatory  Matters; Reasonable Best Efforts._   (a) 
_Regulatory  Approvals._   Each  party hereto shall cooperate and promptly
prepare and file all necessary  documentation, applications, notices,
petitions and filings, and shall use  reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary approvals and authorizations  of  all Governmental Authorities,
necessary or advisable to consummate and make  effective, in the most
expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the Merger  and  the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the FPL Group 
Required Statutory Approvals and the Constellation Required Statutory
Approvals;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  FPL Group shall have primary
responsibility for the preparation and filing  of  any related applications,
filings or other materials with the FPSC and,  _provided  further_ , 
that  Constellation shall have primary responsibility for the preparation and
filing  of any related applications, filings or other materials with the
MPSC. FPL  Group  shall have the right to review and approve in advance all
characterizations  of  the information relating to FPL Group, on the one
hand, and Constellation shall  have the right to review and approve in
advance all characterizations of the  information relating to Constellation,
on the other hand, in either case, that  appear in any application, notice,
petition or filing made in connection with  the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. FPL Group  and Constellation
agree that they will consult and cooperate with each other  with respect to
the obtaining of all such necessary approvals and authorizations  of
Governmental Authorities.

 

 

(b)  _Further  Actions._   Upon the  terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each of the  parties agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,  all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with  the other parties
in doing, all things reasonably necessary or advisable to  consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably  practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, including
(i) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal  proceedings, whether
judicial

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

69  

 

 

 

 

 

 

or  administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any 
stay  or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental  Authority vacated or reversed, and (ii) the execution and
delivery of any  additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement.

 

 

 

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, as used in this Section 5.05, "reasonable
best efforts" shall not include nor require any party to (i) sell, or agree
to sell, hold  or agree to hold separate, or otherwise dispose or agree to
dispose of any  asset, in each case if such sale, separation or disposition
or agreement with  respect thereto would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected  to have a material adverse effect on such party or on
Constellation and its  prospective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii)
conduct or agree to  conduct its business in any particular manner if such
conduct or agreement  with  respect thereto would individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected  to have a material adverse effect on such
party or on Constellation and its  prospective subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

 

 

(c)  _State  Anti-Takeover Statutes._   Without  limiting the generality
of Section 5.05(b), FPL Group and Constellation  shall (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no state anti-takeover  statute or similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger,  this Agreement or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement  and (ii) if any
state anti-takeover statute or similar statute or  regulation becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any other  transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure  that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may  be 
consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated 
by  this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or 
regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement.

converted  automatically, subject to the prior effectiveness of the Stock

number of shares  of  Constellation Common Stock equal to the number of
shares of FPL Group Common  Stock subject to such FPL Group Employee Stock
Option immediately before the  Effective Time at an exercise price per share
equal to the exercise price per  share of such FPL Group Employee Stock

70  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii)  provide that each share of FPL Group Restricted Stock shall be
converted,  subject to the prior effectiveness of the Stock Split, into one

conditions as were applicable to such share of FPL Group  Restricted Stock,
including vesting;

 

 

(iii)  adjust the terms of all outstanding FPL Group Other Equity-Based
Awards, whether  vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that each such
FPL Group Other  Equity-Based Award outstanding immediately prior to the

effectiveness of the Stock Split,  into an equity or equity-based award in
respect of a number of shares of  Constellation Common Stock (each, a "
_FPL  Group Adjusted Other Equity-Based Award_ ")  equal  to the number of
shares of FPL Group Common Stock subject to such FPL Group  Other Equity-
Based Award immediately before the Effective Time, on the same  terms and
conditions as were applicable to such FPL Group Other Equity-Based  Award,
including vesting, and, if such FPL Group Other Equity-Based Award is 
subject to an exercise or subscription price, the exercise or subscription 
price  per share of such FPL Group Adjusted Other Equity-Based Award shall be
equal  to  the exercise or subscription price per share of such FPL Group
Other  Equity-Based Award immediately before the Effective Time (rounded up
to the  nearest whole cent);

 

 

(iv)  use  reasonable best efforts to ensure (A) that the conversion
pursuant to  Section 2.01(b) of any FPL Group Common Stock held by any
director or  officer of FPL Group who is subject to Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act,  (B) the conversion pursuant to this Section 5.06(a) of any FPL

the agreements evidencing the grants of such FPL Group Adjusted  Awards, and
stating that such FPL Group Adjusted Awards and the related  agreements shall
be assumed by Constellation and shall continue in effect on  the  same terms
and conditions, including with respect to vesting (subject to the 
adjustments required by this Section 5.06 after giving effect to the 
Merger).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)  Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement and except to the

to such FPL Group Employee  Stock Options, FPL Group Restricted Stock and FPL
Group Other Equity-Based  Awards, to the extent that such restrictions or
limitations shall not have  already lapsed, shall remain in full force and
effect with respect to the  applicable FPL Group Adjusted Awards after giving

commitments (as such may be amended  in accordance with this Agreement) of

as established or amended in accordance with  or permitted by this Agreement)
that apply to any current or former employee,  or  current or former
director, of FPL Group or any of its subsidiaries and  (ii) continue to honor
all obligations under any contracts, agreements,  collective bargaining
agreements, plans and commitments (as such may be amended  in accordance with

permitted by this Agreement) that apply to any current or former  employee,
or current or former director, of Constellation or any of its  subsidiaries,
including the obligation to issue "replacement options" as  described in
Section 4.01(i) of the Constellation Disclosure Letter;  _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that  the undertakings set forth in this Section 5.08(a) are
not intended to  prevent Constellation and its subsidiaries from enforcing
such contracts,  agreements, collective bargaining agreements, plans and
commitments (as such  may  be amended in accordance with this Agreement) in
accordance with their  respective terms, including any reserved right to
amend, modify, suspend, revoke  or terminate any such contract, agreement,

Constellation  and its subsidiaries shall be made on a fair and equitable
basis (as determined  by Constellation and its subsidiaries), in light of the
circumstances and the  objectives to be achieved,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

75  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

giving  consideration to previous work history, job experience and
qualifications and  such other factors as Constellation and its subsidiaries
consider appropriate,  without regard to whether employment prior to the
Effective Time was with FPL  Group and its subsidiaries or Constellation and
its subsidiaries, and any  employees whose employment is terminated or whose
jobs are eliminated by  Constellation or any of its subsidiaries during such
period shall be entitled  to  participate on a fair and equitable basis (as
determined by Constellation and  its subsidiaries) in the job opportunity and
employment placement programs  offered by Constellation or any of its

(c)  Subject to its obligations under applicable Law and applicable
collective  bargaining agreements, Constellation and its subsidiaries shall
give credit  under each of their respective employee benefit plans, programs
and arrangements  to employees for all service prior to the Effective Time
with FPL Group or  its  subsidiaries, as applicable, or any predecessor
employer (to the extent that  such credit was given by FPL Group or any of
its subsidiaries, as applicable)  (" _Pre-Closing  Service_ ")  for  all
purposes for which such service was taken into account or recognized by 
FPL  Group or its subsidiaries, as applicable (including for benefit accrual
purposes  under any defined benefit pension plans), but not to the extent
crediting such  service would result in duplication of benefits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Constellation and its subsidiaries shall only
be required to provide credit  for  Pre-Closing Service for benefit accrual
purposes under a defined benefit pension  plan if such plan is a FPL Group
Employee Benefit Plan or if such plan has  assumed the assets or liabilities
of a FPL Group Employee Benefit  Plan.

 

 

SECTION  5.09. _Indemnification,  Exculpation and Insurance._   (a)

or  omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in
favor  of  the current or former directors, officers, employees or
fiduciaries under  benefit plans currently indemnified by FPL Group and its
subsidiaries or by  Constellation and its subsidiaries, as provided in their
respective articles  or  certificates of incorporation, by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents)  or other agreements providing
indemnification shall survive the Merger and  shall  continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. In addition,  from and after the
Effective Time, directors, officers, employees and  fiduciaries under benefit
plans currently indemnified by FPL Group or its  subsidiaries or by

employees or fiduciaries under benefit plans of  Constellation will be
entitled to the indemnity rights and protections afforded  to directors,

76

cause the  Surviving Corporations to, maintain in effect the directors and
officers  liability (and fiduciary) insurance policies currently maintained
by  Constellation and FPL Group covering acts or omissions occurring prior to
the  Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered
by  Constellation's or FPL Group's, as the case may be, directors and
officers  liability insurance policies on terms with respect to such coverage
and in  amounts no less favorable than those set forth in the relevant policy
in effect  on the date of this Agreement. If such insurance coverage cannot
be maintained,  Constellation shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain  the  most advantageous policies of directors and officers
insurance otherwise  obtainable.

 

 

(c)  The  provisions of Section 5.09(a) (i) are intended to be for the
benefit  of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her
heirs and  his  or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not
in substitution  for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such person  may have by contract or otherwise.

5.10(b) and 5.10(d) are an integral part of the transactions  contemplated by

against Constellation for the fees set forth in Section 5.10(b) or  5.10(d),

5.10(c) and  5.10(e) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by

enter into this  Agreement; accordingly, if FPL Group fails promptly to pay
the amount due  pursuant to Section 5.10(c) or 5.10(e), and, in order to
obtain such  payment, Constellation commences a suit that results in a
judgment against  FPL  Group for the fees set forth in Section 5.10(c) or

shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the  meaning of Section 368(a) of

counsel referred to in Sections 6.02(c)  and 6.03(c).

assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute  a waiver of such rights.

STOCKHOLDERS

 

Section  1. - _Place of Meetings_.

 

 

Meetings  of stockholders of the Corporation shall be held at such places,
either within  or without the State of Maryland **** or  the  State of
Florida, **** as  may be  fixed from time to time by the Board and stated in
the notice of meeting or  in a  duly executed waiver of notice thereof.

 

 

Section  2. - _Annual Meetings_.

 

 

The  Annual Meeting of the stockholders for the election of Directors and for
the  transaction of general business shall be held on any date during the
period  of  May 1 through May 31 as determined from year to year by the
Board. The time  and  location of the meeting shall be determined by the
Board. Failure to hold an  Annual Meeting does not invalidate the
Corporation's existence or affect any  otherwise valid corporate acts.

 

 

The **** Chief  Executive Officer of the Corporation shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared,  an  annual report containing a full and correct statement
of the affairs of the  Corporation, including a balance sheet and a financial
statement of operations  for the preceding fiscal year, which shall be
submitted to the stockholders  at  or prior to the Annual Meeting.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  3. - _Special Meetings_.

 

 

Special  meetings of the stockholders may be held in Baltimore, Maryland,
Juno Beach,  Florida or in any county within the State of Maryland or the
State of Florida  or  in which the Corporation provides service or owns
property upon call by the  Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer
**** or  a  majority of the Board whenever they deem expedient, or by the
Secretary upon  the  written request of the holders of shares entitled to
not less than a majority  of  all the votes entitled to be cast at such
meeting. Such request of the  stockholders shall state the purpose or
purposes of the meeting and the matters  proposed to be acted on and shall be
delivered to the Secretary, who shall  inform such stockholders of the
reasonably estimated cost of preparing and  mailing such notice of the
meeting, and upon payment to the Corporation of  such  costs the Secretary
shall give notice stating the purpose or purposes of the  meeting to all
stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting. The business  at  all special
meetings shall be confined to that specifically named in the notice  thereof.

 

 

Section  4. - _Notice and Waiver; Organization of Meeting_.

 

 

When  stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting
whether  special or annual, written, printed or electronic notice of every
meeting shall  be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting
and each other  stockholder entitled to notice of the meeting. The notice
shall state the place,  day, and hour of such meeting and, in the case of a
special meeting, the purpose  or purposes for which the meeting is called.
The notice of any meeting shall  be  given, personally, by mail or
electronically, not less than 10 or more than  90  days before the date of
the meeting.

 

 

Any  notice given by the Corporation to a stockholder is effective if given
by a  single notice, in writing or by electronic transmission, to all
stockholders  who  share an address if the Corporation gives notice, in
writing or by electronic  transmission, to the stockholder of its intent to
give a single notice and  the  stockholder consents to receiving a single
notice or fails to object in writing  within 60 days after the Corporation
gives notice to the stockholder of its  intent to give a single notice. A
stockholder may revoke consent given, whether  affirmative or implied, by
written notice to the Corporation. The notice shall  state the time of the
meeting, the place of the meeting, if any, and the means  of remote
communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may  be 
deemed to be present in person and may vote at the meeting and, if the
meeting  is a special meeting or notice of the purpose is required by
statute, the  purpose of the meeting. Notice is given to a stockholder when
it is personally  delivered to the stockholder, left at the stockholder's
residence or usual place  of business, mailed to the stockholder at the
stockholder's address as it  appears on the records of the Corporation or
transmitted to the stockholder  by  an electronic transmission to any
address or number of the stockholder at which  the stockholder receives
electronic transmissions. If the Corporation has  received a request from a
stockholder that notice not be sent by electronic  transmission, the
Corporation may not provide notice to the stockholder by  electronic
transmission. Notice given by electronic transmission shall be  considered
ineffective if the Corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive  notices
and the inability to deliver the notices becomes known to the Secretary,  an
Assistant Secretary, the transfer agent or other person responsible for 
giving the notice. The inadvertent failure to deliver any notice by
electronic  transmission does not invalidate any meeting or other action. An
affidavit  of  the Secretary, the transfer agent or other agent of the
Corporation that notice  has been given by a form of electronic transmission,
in the absence of actual  fraud, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts
stated in the  affidavit.

 

 

The  business at all special meetings shall be confined to that specifically
named  in  the notice thereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

When  a  meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be
given of  the  adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced
at the meeting  at  which the adjournment is taken unless the adjournment is
to a date more than  120  days after the original record date, or, if after
the adjournment, a new record  date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in
which circumstances a notice of  the  adjourned meeting shall be given to
each stockholder of record entitled to  vote  at the meeting. At the
adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any  business which might have
been transacted at the original meeting.

 

 

Notice  of  any meeting of stockholders may be waived before or after the
meeting in writing  or by electronic transmission by any stockholder entitled
to notice of such  meeting. Attendance at a meeting by any stockholder, in
person or by proxy,  shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting,
except when the person  attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting, at the beginning of  the  meeting, to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully  called or convened.

 

 

All  meetings of the stockholders shall be called to order by the Chairman of
the  Board, or in his or her absence by the Chief Executive Officer, the
President  or  a Vice President; or in the case of the absence of such
Officers, then by any  stockholder. The party calling the meeting to order
shall be Chairman of the  meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation, if
present, shall act as secretary  of  the meeting, unless some other person
shall be elected by the stockholders  at  the meeting to act as secretary.
An accurate record of the meeting shall be  kept  by the secretary thereof,
and placed in the record books of the  Corporation.

 

 

Section  5. - _Order of Business_.

 

 

(a) At  any  Annual Meeting, only such business shall be conducted as shall
have been brought  before the Annual Meeting (i) by or at the direction of
the Board, or (ii)  by  any stockholder who complies with the procedures set
forth in this Section  5.

 

 

(b) For  nominations or other business to be brought properly before an
Annual Meeting  by  a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely
notice thereof in proper  written form to the Secretary of the Corporation.
To be timely, a stockholder's  notice must be delivered to or mailed and
received at the principal office  of  the Corporation not less than 90 days
nor more than 120 days prior to the  anniversary of the date on which notice
of the prior year's Annual Meeting was  given to stockholders in accordance
with Section 4 of this Article II. Notices  sent by facsimile or
electronically will not be accepted by the Secretary of  the  Corporation.
To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the  Secretary shall
set forth in writing as to each matter the stockholder proposes  to bring
before the Annual Meeting:

 

 

(i) as  to  each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for
election or  re-election as a Director, all information relating to such
person that is  required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for
election of Directors,  or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to
Regulation 14A under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange
Act") or any applicable successor  provisions thereto, including such
person's written consent to being named in  the proxy statement as a nominee
and to serving as a Director if elected; and  as  to the stockholder giving
the notice, the name and address, as they appear  on  the Corporation's
books, of the stockholder proposing such nomination and the  class and number
of shares of stock of the Corporation which are beneficially  owned by the
stockholder.

 

 

(ii) as  to any  other business that the stockholder proposes to bring
before the  meeting:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(A) a  brief  description of the business desired to be brought before the
Annual Meeting  and  the reasons for conducting such business at the Annual
Meeting;

 

 

(B) the  name  and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of
the stockholder  proposing such business;

 

 

(C) the  class  and number of shares of stock of the Corporation which are
beneficially owned  by  the stockholder; and

 

 

(D) any  material interest of the stockholder in such business.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at  an  Annual Meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this  Section 5 of Article II. The Chairman of an
Annual Meeting shall, if the facts  warrant, determine and declare at the
Annual Meeting that business was not  properly brought before the Annual
Meeting in accordance with the provisions  of  this Section 5 of Article II
and, if the Chairman should so determine, he or  she  shall so declare at
the Annual Meeting and any such business not properly  brought before the
Annual Meeting shall not be transacted.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  the foregoing provisions of this Section, a stockholder
shall also comply with  all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations  thereunder with respect to the matters set forth
in this Section. Nothing in  this Section shall be deemed to affect any
rights of stockholders to request  inclusion of proposals in the
Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule  14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

 

 

Section  6. - _Quorum_.

 

 

At  any  meeting of the stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of
stockholders  entitled to cast a majority of the votes thereat shall
constitute a quorum  for  the transaction of business.

 

 

When  a  quorum is once present to organize a meeting, it is not broken by
the subsequent  withdrawal of any stockholders.

 

 

The  stockholders present, although less than a quorum, may adjourn the
meeting  to  another time or place; provided that notice of such adjourned
meeting is given  in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 of this
Article II.

 

 

Section  7. - _Voting; Proxies_.

 

 

At  all  meetings of the stockholders each stockholder shall be entitled to
one vote  for  each share of Common Stock standing in his or her name and,
when the Preferred  Stock is entitled to vote, such number of votes as shall
be provided in the  Charter of the Corporation for each share of Preferred
Stock standing in his  or  her name, and the votes shall be cast by
stockholders in person or by lawful  proxy. However, no proxy shall be voted
11 months after the date thereof, unless  the proxy provides for a longer
period.

 

 

Section  8. - _Control Shares_.

 

 

Notwithstanding  any other provision of the Charter of the Corporation or
these By-Laws, Title  3,  Subtitle 7 of the Maryland General Corporation Law
(or any successor statute)  shall not apply to any acquisition by any person
of shares of stock of the  Corporation. This section may be repealed, in
whole or in part, at any time,  whether before or after an acquisition of
control shares and, upon such repeal,  such

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

statute  may, to the extent provided by any successor by-law, apply to any
prior or  subsequent control share acquisition.

 

 

Section  9. - _Method of Voting_.

 

 

All  elections and all other questions shall be decided by a majority of the
votes  cast, at a meeting at which a quorum is present, except as expressly
provided  otherwise by the general laws of the State of Maryland or the
Charter and except  that Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the
votes cast.

 

 

Section  10. - _Ownership of its Own Stock_.

 

 

Shares  of  capital stock of the Corporation held by either (i) the
Corporation or (ii)  another corporation, if a majority of the shares
entitled to vote in the  election of Directors of such other corporation is
held, directly or indirectly,  by the Corporation (a "Controlled
Corporation"), shall neither be entitled to  vote nor be counted for quorum
purposes. Nothing in this Section 10 shall be  construed as limiting the
right of the Corporation or any Controlled Corporation  to vote stock of the
Corporation held by it in a fiduciary  capacity.

 

 

Section  11. - _Inspectors_.

 

 

The  Board, in advance of any meeting, may, but need not, appoint one or
more  individual inspectors or one or more entities that designate
individuals as  inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.
If an inspector  or  inspectors are not appointed, the person presiding at
the meeting may, but  need  not, appoint one or more inspectors. In case any
person who may be appointed  as  an inspector fails to appear or act, the
vacancy may be filled by appointment  made by the Board in advance of the
meeting or at the meeting by the chairman  of  the meeting. The inspectors,
if any, shall determine the number of shares  outstanding and the voting
power of each, the shares represented at the meeting,  the existence of a
quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive  votes, ballots
or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions  arising in
connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes,  ballots or
consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to  conduct
the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders. Each such report 
shall be in writing and signed by him or her or by a majority of them if
there  is more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more
than one  inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the
inspectors.  The  report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of
shares represented at  the  meeting and the results of the voting shall be
prima facie evidence  thereof. ****

 

 

Section  12. - _Record  Date for Stockholders; Closing of Transfer Books_.

 

 

The  Board  may fix, in advance, a date as the record for the determination
of the  stockholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, any meeting of
stockholders,  or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or entitled to
the allotment  of  any rights, or for any other proper purpose. Such date in
any case shall not  be  more than 90 days (and in the case of a meeting of
stockholders not less than  10  days) prior to the date on which the
particular action requiring such  determination of stockholders is to be
taken (other than in the case of an  adjournment). Only stockholders of
record on such date shall be entitled to  notice of or to vote at such
meeting or to receive such dividends or rights,  as  the case may be. In
lieu of fixing a record date the Board may close the stock  transfer books of
the Corporation for a period not exceeding 20 nor less than  10  days
preceding the date of any meeting of stockholders or not exceeding 20  days 
preceding any other of the above mentioned events.

Board  for  the transaction of business. If a quorum is not present at any
meeting, a  majority of the Directors present may adjourn to any time and

Section  9. - _Committees_.

 

 

The  Board  is authorized to appoint from among its members, one or more
committees as  it  may, from time to time, deem advisable and to delegate to
such committee or  committees any of the powers of the Board that it may
lawfully  delegate. **** The  audit  committee shall have, at a minimum,
the number of members required by applicable  law or stock exchange listing
standards. The Directors shall annually elect  members of the Board to be the
members of each committee. The members of the  committees shall hold their
offices for one year and until their successors,  whom shall be appointed in
accordance with this Section 9, are elected and  qualified, or until their
earlier resignation or removal. All vacancies in  said  committees shall be
filled by the Board subject to the restrictions on  membership contained in
this Section 9\. The purposes and authority of each  committee shall be as
set forth in applicable law, board resolution or committee  charter. Any such
charter shall be approved annually by the Board.

Dear  Sirs:

 



 

The  undersigned, a holder of shares of common stock, par value $.01 per
share (the  " _FPL  Group Common Stock_ "),  of  FPL Group, Inc., a
Florida corporation (the " _Company_ "), acknowledges that  the undersigned
may be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company within the meaning  of Rule 145
(" _Rule  145_ ")  promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the " _Securities  Act_ "),  by  the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ").  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the " _Merger  Agreement_ ")  dated  as of December 18, 2005, among the
Company, Constellation Energy Group, Inc.,  a  Maryland corporation ("
_Constellation_ "),  and  CF Merger Corporation, a Florida corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary  of  Constellation (" _Merger  Sub_ "),  Merger
Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ")  and  each
share of FPL Group Common Stock will be converted into one share of common 
stock, no par value per share, of Constellation (the " _Constellation  Common
Stock_ ").  Capitalized terms used but not defined in this letter have the
meanings ascribed  to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

 

 

If  in  fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the Securities Act,
the  undersigned's ability to sell, assign or transfer the Constellation
Common Stock  received by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of FPL
Group Common  Stock  pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such
transaction is registered  under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available.  The undersigned understands that such exemptions
are limited and the undersigned  has obtained or will obtain advice of
counsel as to the nature and conditions  of  such exemptions, including
information with respect to the applicability to  the  sale of such
securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities  Act. The
undersigned understands that Constellation will not be required to  maintain
the effectiveness of any registration statement under the Securities  Act for
the purposes of resale of Constellation Common Stock by the  undersigned.

 

 

The  undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Constellation that
the  undersigned will not sell, assign or transfer any of the Constellation
Common  Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for shares of FPL Group
Common  Stock pursuant to the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective
registration  statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the
volume and  other  limitations of Rule 145 or (iii) in a transaction which,
in the opinion of  counsel reasonably satisfactory to Constellation, or as
described in a "no  action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the SEC,
is not required to be  registered under the Securities Act.

 

 

In  the  event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned pursuant to
Rule 145  of  Constellation Common Stock received by the undersigned in the
Merger, the  undersigned will supply Constellation with evidence of
compliance with such  Rule, in the form of a letter in the form of Annex I
hereto or the opinion  of  counsel or no-action letter referred to above.
The undersigned understands  that  Constellation may instruct its transfer
agent to withhold the transfer of any  Constellation Common Stock disposed of
by the undersigned, but that (provided  such transfer is not prohibited by
any other provision of this letter agreement)  upon receipt of such

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence  of compliance, Constellation shall cause the transfer agent to
effectuate the  transfer of the Constellation Common Stock sold as indicated
in such  letter.

 

 

Constellation  covenants that it will take all such actions as may be
reasonably available  to  it to permit the sale or other disposition of the
shares of Constellation Common  Stock by the undersigned under Rule 145 in
accordance with the terms  thereof.

 

 

The  undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the legend set forth below will
be  placed on certificates representing the shares of Constellation Common
Stock  received by the undersigned in connection with the Merger or held by
a  transferee thereof, which legend will be removed by delivery of
substitute  certificates (i) if the undersigned provides evidence of
compliance with Rule  145 to Constellation, in the form of a letter in the
form of Annex I hereto,  or  (ii) upon receipt of an opinion in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory  to  Constellation from counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Constellation to the  effect that such legend is no longer
required for purposes of the Securities  Act.

 

 

There  will be placed on the certificates for Constellation Common Stock
issued to  the  undersigned pursuant to the Merger, or any substitutions
therefor, a legend  stating in substance:

 

 

"The  shares represented by this certificate were issued pursuant to a
transaction  to  which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies. The shares  may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except
in accordance with  Rule  145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
pursuant to a Registration  Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 or in
accordance with an exemption  from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933."

 

 

The  undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read
this letter  and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations
imposed upon the  distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of
Constellation Common Stock  and (ii) the receipt by Constellation of this
letter is an inducement and a  condition to Constellation's obligations to
consummate the Merger.

 

 

Execution  of this letter should not be considered an admission on the part
of the  undersigned that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of the Company as
described  in the first paragraph of this letter, or as a waiver of any
rights the  undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned
is such an  affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

 

 

Very  truly yours,
