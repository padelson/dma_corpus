that the statements contained in this Section 4 are true, correct and accurate
on the date hereof.

  

  

(a) Organization and Existence.

good standing under the laws of Switzerland.

  

  

(b) Authorization and Enforceability. Sellers have full power and authority to

the valid and legally binding obligation of Sellers, enforceable in accordance

(c) No Notice or Filing, etc. Sellers need not give any notice to, make any
filing with, or obtain any authorization, consent, or approval of, any
Governmental Body in order to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Agreements have been
duly authorized by Sellers.

  

  

(d) No Violation and No Contravention. Neither the execution and delivery of
any of the Transaction Agreements, nor the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions, shall (i) violate any constitution, statute, regulation, rule,
injunction, judgment, order, decree, ruling, charge, or other restriction of
any Governmental Body, or court to which Sellers are subject or any provision
of its Organizational Documents or (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of,
constitute a default under, result in the acceleration of, create in any
Person the right to accelerate, terminate, modify, or cancel, or require any

Goldman Sachs Co.

  

  

(f) No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in the Transaction Agreements, Sellers do not make any
other express or implied representation or warranty on behalf of or with
respect to Sellers, the Business, the Company, the Transferred Assets,
Transferred IP or Transferred Products.

  

  

Section 5. Post-Closing Covenants.

  

  

(a) Non-Competition. Other than as contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
for a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, no Seller shall,
directly or indirectly, engage, invest in, own, manage, operate, finance,
control, or advise or render services in connection with the Business to, any
Person engaged in the Business in the Field. "Field" means printers, all-in-
one products and corresponding cartridges, parts and supplies incorporating
inkjet technology, whether thermal or piezo electric and includes cartridges,
parts and supplies manufactured on or after July 1, 2013 that are compatible
with any product marketed and/or sold by Seller. The term "Field" does not
include the following technologies: (i) hand-held, bar code labeling, and
point-of-sale printing technology, (ii) microfluidic pump technology, (iii)
printed electronics

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

  

  

technology, and (iv) Future Product technology, but only to the extent that
such Future Product technology is designed primarily by or on behalf of an
original equipment manufacturer other than Seller.

 

  

  

(b) Transferred Products. Buyer agrees that for a minimum of four years from
the Closing Date, it shall make its commercially reasonable efforts to
manufacture and sell cartridges, parts and supplies compatible with the
Transferred Products in sufficient quantities to satisfy any demand generated
by existing customers of such Transferred Products. "Transferred Products"
means the following products marketed and/or sold by Seller: Pro715, Pro915,
S315, S415, S515, OfficeEdge Pro4000, OfficeEdge Pro4000c, OfficeEdge Pro5500,
and OfficeEdge Pro5500t, but does not include any equivalent products sold to
any customer of Seller for resale under the brand of such customer.

  

  

(c) Further Actions. In case at any time after the Closing any further action
is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party
reasonably may request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting
Party.

  

  

Section 6. Termination.

  

  

(a) Cause for Termination. Subject to Section 6(b) and 7(g), by notice given
prior to or at the Closing, all of the Transaction Agreements may be
terminated as follows:

  

  

(i) by mutual consent of Buyer and Sellers;

  

  

(ii) by Buyer if a material Breach of any provision of the Transaction
Agreements has been committed by any Seller;

  

  

(iii) by Sellers if a material Breach of any provision of the Transaction
Agreements has been committed by Buyer;

  

  

(iv) by Buyer if satisfaction of any condition in Section 2(f) by June 30,
2013 or such later date as the parties may agree upon (the "End Date") becomes
impossible (other than through the failure of Buyer to comply with its
material obligations under the Transaction Agreements);

  

  

(v) by Sellers if satisfaction of any condition in Section 2(e) by the End
Date becomes impossible (other than through the failure of any Seller to
comply with its obligations under the

  

Transaction Agreements);

  

  

(vi) by Buyer if the Closing has not occurred on or before the End Date,
unless Buyer is in material Breach of the Transaction Agreements; or

  

  

(vii) by Sellers if the Closing has not occurred on or before the End Date,
unless Sellers are in material Breach of the Transaction Agreements.

  

  

(b) Effect of Termination. Buyer's or Sellers' right of termination under
Section 6(a) is in addition to any other right it may have under the
Transaction Agreements, at law or in equity,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

  

  

and the exercise of such right of termination will not constitute an election
of remedies. If any Transaction Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
6(a), such Transaction Agreement shall be of no further force or effect;
provided, however, that (i) Sections 6(b), 7, 8 and 9 shall survive the
termination of such Transaction Agreement and will remain in full force and
effect, and (ii) the termination of any such Transaction Agreement will not
relieve any Party from any liability for any Breach of such Transaction
Agreement occurring prior to termination.

 

  

  

Section 7. Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Indemnification by Sellers. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Sections 7(b), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i), Sellers shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold Buyer, its Affiliates (including the Company
after the Closing Date) and their respective officers, directors, employees
and agents, successors and assigns ("Buyer Indemnified Persons"), harmless
from and against:

  

  

(i) any Losses incurred related to the Transferred Assets, the Transferred IP
or the Business of Sellers (including that of the Company prior to the Closing
Date), but only if and to the extent that any such Losses arise out of an
Event occurring prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that in no event
shall Sellers be liable to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Persons under this
Section 7(a)(i) for any Losses that arise out of (A) any claim of patent
infringement related to a design created by Sellers prior to the Closing Date
and incorporated into a product sold by Buyer on or after the Closing Date, or
(B) a defect in the design created by Sellers prior to the Closing Date and
incorporated into a product sold by Buyer on or after the Closing Date;
provided further, that nothing in this Section 7(a)(i) shall limit any
indemnification rights of Buyer under any agreement that is not a Transaction
Agreement;

  

  

(ii) any Losses incurred related to the Excluded Assets and the Retained
Liabilities;

  

  

(iii) any Losses incurred due to any Breach of the representations and
warranties (other than Fundamental Warranties) made by Sellers under any of
the Transaction Agreements;

  

  

(iv) any Losses incurred due to material Breach to perform any agreement,
covenant or undertaking expressly binding on Sellers pursuant to any of the
Transaction Agreements; or

  

  

(v) any Losses for which Sellers are obligated to indemnify Buyer in
connection with Section 5(b)(ii) of the Share Purchase Agreement; provided
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the processes and
procedures of such indemnification shall be governed by Section 5(b) of the
Share Purchase Agreement;

  

  

(vi) any Losses incurred due to any Breach of the Fundamental Warranties made
by Sellers under any of the Transaction Agreements; or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

  

  

(vii) any Losses incurred due to any Breach of any statement set forth under
any certificate delivered under any Transaction Agreement.

 

  

  

(b) Limitations of Sellers' Indemnity.

  

  

(i) Sellers' obligation to make any indemnification payment under Section 7(a)
shall be triggered after the indemnifiable amount exceeds Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000), at which point, Sellers will be obligated to
indemnify Buyer from and against all such Losses suffered in excess of such
threshold amount.

  

  

(ii) In no event shall the amount payable under Sellers' obligations to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons under Section 7(a)(iii) or 7(a)(vii)
(except to the extent of a Breach of a Fundamental Warranty certified to
thereunder) exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), and in no event shall
the amount payable under Sellers' obligations to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Persons under Section 7(a)(i), 7(a)(ii), 7(a)(iv), 7(a)(v), or
7(a)(vi) exceed the Purchase Price. Moreover, Buyer shall not be entitled to
bring any claim under Section 7(a)(iii), 7(a)(vi) or 7(a)(vii) at any time
after the 15 month anniversary of the Closing Date; provided that any claim
with respect to any Fundamental Warranty may be brought until the date of the
expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the subject matter of
such Fundamental Warranty.

  

  

(c) Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections
7(d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i), Buyer shall indemnify and hold Sellers, its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents,
successors and assigns ("Seller Indemnified Persons") harmless from and
against:

  

  

(i) any Losses related to the Transferred Assets, the Transferred IP or the
Business of Buyer (including that of the Company on or after the Closing
Date), but only if and to the extent that any such Losses arise out of Events
occurring on or after the Closing Date which Sellers are not obligated to
indemnify Buyer for under Section 7(a);

  

  

(ii) any Losses incurred by any Breach of the representations and warranties
made by Buyer under this Agreement; or

  

  

(iii) any Losses incurred by any material Breach to perform any agreement,
covenant or undertaking expressly binding on Buyer pursuant to any of the
Transaction Agreements.

  

  

(d) Limitation of Buyer's Indemnity.

  

  

(i) Buyer's obligation to make any indemnification payment under Section 7(c)
shall be triggered after the indemnifiable amount exceeds Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000), at which point, Buyer shall be obligated to
indemnify Sellers from and against all such Losses suffered in excess of such
threshold amount.

  

  

(ii) In no event shall the amount payable under Buyer's obligations to
indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons under Section 7(c) exceed the
Purchase

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

  

  

Price. Moreover, Seller shall not be entitled to bring any claim under Section
7(c)(ii) at any time after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to such representations or warranties.

 

  

  

(e) Notices and Cure Time. In the event that a Buyer Indemnified Person or
Seller Indemnified Person, as relevant (the "Indemnified Person") has a direct
claim against Sellers or Buyer, as relevant (the "Indemnifying Party") for a
Loss under Section 7(a) or (c), the Indemnified Person shall promptly notify
the Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim, which written notice also
includes (i) a detailed description of the facts and circumstances giving rise
to an alleged Loss, and (ii) the aggregate amount being claimed with respect
to the Loss, if any. If a Breach giving rise to such Loss set forth in Section
7(a) or Section 7(c) is capable of remedy, the Indemnified Person shall only
be entitled to indemnification if it gives such written notice of the Breach
and the Breach is not remedied within thirty (30) days from the date on which
such written notice is received by the Indemnifying Party.

  

  

(f) WAIVER. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS SECTION 7 TO THE CONTRARY, ON OR
AFTER THE CLOSING, NO INDEMNIFYING PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATE SHALL BE LIABLE TO
ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON FOR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR
EXEMPLARY LOSSES OR DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE,
WHETHER OR NOT SUCH LOSSES WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE, OTHER THAN WITH
RESPECT TO ANY SUCH LOSSES INCLUDED IN A THIRD PARTY CLAIM AS TO WHICH AN
INDEMNIFYING PARTY IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION
8.

  

  

(g) Exclusive Remedy. Each Party hereto acknowledges and agrees that on or
after the Closing, the indemnification provisions in this Section 7 shall be
the exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Person with respect to all claims
arising under or related to any of the Transaction Agreements or the
Contemplated Transactions.

  

  

(h) Subrogation and Mitigation. After any indemnification payment is made
pursuant to this Section 7, the Indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of
such payment, be subrogated to all rights (if any) of the Indemnified Person
against any third party in connection with the Losses to which such payment
relates. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any
Indemnified Person receiving an indemnification payment pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall execute, upon the written request of the Indemnifying
Party, any instrument reasonably necessary to evidence such subrogation
rights. The Indemnified Persons shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Loss in respect of which the Indemnifying Party asserts an
indemnity claim under this Section 7.

  

  

(i) Net Recovery. The indemnified amount under this Section 7 shall be
calculated net of: (A) any tax benefit received or receivable by the
Indemnified Person for the Losses giving rise to the indemnification; and (B)
the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution
payments or reimbursements received or receivable by the Indemnified Person
for the Losses. The Indemnified Person shall seek full recovery under all
insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as they would be
entitled to seek if such Loss was not subject to indemnification hereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 8. Third Party Claim.

  

  

(a) Indemnification regarding Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Person shall
receive notice of the assertion by any Third Party of any Loss or claim or
commencement of any Loss (a "Third Party Claim") with respect to which such
Indemnifying Party is or may be obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder; provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the Third Party Claim, which
notice shall also set forth: (i) a detailed description of the facts and
circumstances giving rise to the Third Party Claim, and (ii) the aggregate
amount of the Losses being claimed with respect to the Third Party Claim, if
any (the "Third Party Claim Notice") and provided, further, that no failure or
delay on the part of the Indemnified Person in notifying the Indemnifying
Party shall relieve from, or otherwise affect, the obligation of the
Indemnifying Party to provide indemnification under this Section 8, except to
the extent that any Liabilities directly resulted from or were caused by such
failure, or the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.

  


 

  

(b) Terms of Defense of Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Third Party Claim Notice (unless the
claim or action requires a response before the expiration of such thirty-day
period, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall have until five (5) days
before the required response date) to undertake, conduct and control, through
counsel of its own choosing, the settlement or defense of the Third Party
Claim, and the Indemnified Person shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
in connection therewith; provided, however, that (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall permit the Indemnified Person to participate in such settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Person, provided that the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be borne by the Indemnifying
Party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim
without the Indemnified Person's consent if the settlement requires the
Indemnified Person to admit wrongdoing, pay any fines or refrain from any
material action and (iii) if, in the written opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person has separate defenses from the
Indemnifying Party and there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnified
Person and Indemnifying Parties or if there is any danger of criminal
Liability of the Indemnified Person, then the Indemnified Person shall be
permitted to retain special counsel of its own choosing at the sole expense of
the Indemnified Person.

  


 

  

(c) Failure to Undertake Defense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party
fails to undertake the defense of a Third Party Claim in the manner and within
the period provided in Section 8(b), the Indemnified Person may conduct the
defense of the Third Party Claim at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, and
the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by any determination resulting from such
Third Party Claim or any compromise or settlement made by the Indemnified
Person.

  

  

(d) Settlement of Claims. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party is
undertaking the defense of the Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 8(b)
above, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle such claim without the
Indemnifying Party's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, and any such payment or settlement of a Third Party Claim shall
include a full, complete and irrevocable release for the benefit of the
Indemnifying Party.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Reimbursement. Any claim under this Section 8 for any matter involving a
Third Party Claim shall be indemnified, paid, or reimbursed promptly. If the
Indemnified Person shall assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 8, the Indemnifying Party shall
reimburse the Indemnified Person for the costs of investigation and the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Person.

respective successors and permitted assigns and the Indemnified Persons.

Contemplated Transactions (and any replacement thereof), and (C) in connection

Registration of the transfer of the Shares and the tax clearance from the

attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company for

to the Company an amount equal to the Taxes as shown on the Seller Return not
later than two business days before the due date (including any extensions for

preparation and filing) with the appropriate Governmental Authorities any Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company with respect to a taxable period
beginning before or after December 31, 2012 that are due after the Closing
Date other than Seller Returns (the "Buyer Returns"). If any Tax shown as due
on such Buyer Return includes any Pre-Closing Taxes (as defined below) or
could otherwise be reasonably expected to affect the Tax liability of Seller
(taking into account the indemnification obligations of Stockholders
hereunder), Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of any Buyer Returns at
least 15 days prior to the due date thereof (giving effect to any extensions)
(or, if required to be filed within 15 days after the Closing Date, as soon as
possible following the Closing Date) accompanied by a statement (the "Pre-
Closing Tax Statement") setting forth and calculating in reasonable detail the
Pre-Closing Taxes shown as due on the Buyer Return. If Seller agrees with the
Buyer Return and Pre-Closing Tax Statement, Seller shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the Pre-Closing Taxes as shown on the Pre-Closing Tax
Statement not later than two Business Days before the due date (including any
extensions) for payment of Taxes with respect to such Buyer Return. If, within
10 days of the receipt of the Buyer Return and Pre-Closing Tax Statement,
Seller notifies Buyer that it disputes the manner of preparation of the Buyer
Return or the amount of Pre-Closing Taxes calculated in the Pre-Closing Tax
Statement, and provides Buyer its proposed form of Buyer Return, a statement
setting forth and calculating in reasonable detail the Pre-Closing Taxes, and
a written explanation of the reasons for its adjustment, then Buyer and Seller
shall attempt to resolve their disagreement within the five days following
Seller's notification to Buyer of such disagreement. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to resolve their disagreement, the dispute shall be submitted to a
nationally recognized accounting firm in the Philippines that neither Buyer or
Seller have used within the last two years or is otherwise mutually acceptable
to Buyer and Seller (the "Arbitrator"), whose expense shall be borne equally
by Buyer on the one hand, and Seller on the other, for resolution within 10
days of such submission. The decision of the Arbitrator with respect to such
dispute shall be binding upon Buyer and Seller, and Seller shall pay to the
Company an amount equal to the Pre-Closing Taxes as decided by the Arbitrator
not later than two business days before the due date (including any
extensions) for payment of Taxes with respect to such Buyer Return.

  

  

(v) Straddle Period and Pre-Closing Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, in
the case of any Taxes with respect to any Tax Return with respect to the
Company for a taxable period ending after the Closing Date that includes the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such Taxes that
constitutes "Pre-Closing Taxes" shall (a) in the case of Taxes that are either
(x) based upon or related to income or receipts or (y) imposed in connection
with any sale, transfer or assignment or any deemed sale, transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) or other
reasonably identifiable transaction, be deemed equal to the amount that would
be payable if the Tax period ended at the close of business on the date of the
Closing and (b) in the case of Taxes (other than those described in clause
(a)) imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the business or assets of the
Company, be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including
net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be
allocated under this Section shall be computed by reference to the level of
such items at the close of business on the Closing Date. The parties shall, to
the extent permitted by Law, elect with the relevant Governmental Body to
treat a portion of any Straddle Period as a short Tax period ending as of the
close of business on the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(vi) Reimbursement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Seller or Buyer,
as the case may be, shall provide, without limitation, reimbursement for any
Tax paid by one Party, all or a portion of which is the responsibility of the
other Party in accordance with the terms of this Section. Not later than 10
days prior to the payment of any said Tax (or, if required to be paid within
10 days after the Closing Date, as soon as possible following the Closing
Date), the party paying such Tax shall give notice to the other party of the
Tax payable and the portion which is the liability of each party, although
failure to provide such notice will not relieve the other party from its
liability hereunder.

  

  

(vii) Tax Refunds. Any refund of Taxes of the Company that are received by
Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or the Company and any amounts credited against
any Tax to which Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or the Company becomes entitled
that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company shall be for the
account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller any such refund or the
amount of any such credit within 10 days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

  

  

(viii) Tax Contest. Any Party who receives any notice of a pending or
threatened Tax audit, assessment, or adjustment against or with respect to the
Company which may give rise to liability of any other party hereto, shall
promptly notify the other party hereto within five business days of the
receipt of such notice. Such notice shall contain factual information
describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received from any Governmental Body in
respect of any such audit, assessment or adjustment. Failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under this Section
except to the extent the indemnifying party (the "Tax Indemnifying Person")
shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the Tax
Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the
period in which the Tax Indemnified Person (as defined below) failed to give
such notice). Thereafter, the party who is entitled to indemnification
hereunder (the "Tax Indemnified Person") shall deliver to the Tax Indemnifying
Person, as promptly as possible but in no event later than ten days after the
Tax Indemnified Person's receipt thereof, copies of all relevant notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Tax Indemnified Person. The
Parties each agree to consult with and to keep the other party informed on a
regular basis regarding the status of any Tax audit or proceeding to the
extent that such audit or proceeding could affect a liability of such other
party or its Affiliates (including indemnity obligations hereunder), and
provide the other party with copies of all written correspondence with respect
to such audit or proceeding in a timely manner. In the case of an audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding relating solely to a taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall have the right, at its
expense, to control the conduct of such audit or proceeding. Buyer shall have
the right to participate in such proceeding at its own expense, and shall be
entitled to control the disposition of any issue involved in such proceeding
which does not affect a potential obligation of Seller (including Seller's
obligation to indemnify Buyer). If Seller does not timely take control of such
audit or proceeding, Buyer may, at the cost and expense of Seller, control the
conduct of the audit or proceeding. Both Buyer and Seller shall be entitled to
represent their own interests in light of their responsibilities (including
indemnity obligations) for the related Taxes, at their own expense, in any
audit or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any Taxes with
respect to any Tax Return of the Company for a Straddle Period, and no such
audit or proceeding may be settled or compromised by Buyer or Seller without
the consent of both Buyer and Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(ix) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

  

  

(A) Buyer, the Company and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

  

  

pursuant to this Section 5(b)(vii) and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other Party\'s request) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such audit litigation or other proceeding
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Company and Seller agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other
Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests, the
Company or Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take
possession of such books and records.

 

  

  

(B) Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body or any
other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

  

  

(C) Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to provide the other Party
with all information in such Party's possession, custody or control that
either Party may be required to report pursuant to any applicable Law.

  

  

(x) Certain Taxes and Fees. All conveyance fees, recording charges and other
fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be paid by Seller when due.

  

  

(c) Employee Matters.

  

  

(i) Employees. The Parties intend that there will be a continuity of
employment for the Company employees, who have not been terminated prior to
Closing due to redundancy, at not lower than their current compensation,
benefits and responsibility levels. For this purpose, Seller intends to cause
the Company to enter into retention agreements (the "Key Employee Retention
Agreements") with certain employees of the Company prior to the Closing Date,
which shall provide that such employees who execute the Key Employee Retention
Agreements are entitled to certain payments from Company in the event that
they meet certain requirements under the Key Employee Retention Agreements.
With respect to the employees who execute Key Employee Retention Agreements,
the Buyer shall consult the Seller prior to the termination of employment of
such employees. In addition, Seller intends to cause the Company to enter into
incentive agreements ("Other Incentive Agreements") with all other employees
of the Company prior to the Closing, which shall provide that the employees
who execute such Other Incentive Agreements are entitled to certain payments
from the Company in the event that they meet certain requirements under the
Other Incentive Agreements. The Seller hereby agrees that it shall be liable
to make payment to the Company equal to all payments due and owing under the
Key Employee Retention Agreements and Other Incentive Agreements. In
furtherance thereof, Seller shall pay to the Company the amount certified by
the Company as due and owing under the terms of such Key Employee Retention
Agreements and Other Incentive Agreements from time to time, within 30 days
after receipt of such certification, including proof of compliance by the
applicable employees with the requirements of the relevant retention and
incentive agreements. The Company shall pay any and all amounts due

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

21  

  

 

 

  

  

under either the Key Employee Retention Agreements or the Other Incentive
Agreements within the next two pay cycles after receipt of funds from Seller.

 

  

  

(ii) Obligations of Buyer; Comparability of Benefits. Buyer shall maintain, or
shall cause the Company to maintain, all Employee Benefit Plans and other
employment-related obligations and agreements with respect to any current
employees of the Company ("the Company Employees") without material increase
to such the Company Employees contribution amounts, provided, however, that
nothing herein shall preclude Buyer or the Company from amending, modifying,
suspending or terminating any or all Employee Benefit Plans or other
employment-related obligations or agreements with respect to any the Company
Employees in its discretion at any time, provided, further, that such
amendment, modification, suspension or termination shall not materially reduce
in the aggregate the benefits provided to the Company Employees as of
immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

(iii) Pre-Existing Limitations; Service Credit. With respect to any Employee
Benefit Plans of Buyer or its Affiliates in which the Company Employees
participate after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company or such
Affiliates to recognize all regular employee service of the Company Employees
with the Company and its current and former Affiliates for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting, form of payment and calculation of the
rate of benefits (if applicable) relating to service after the Closing, but
not (A) to the extent such recognition would result in duplication of benefits
or (B) for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan
or equity plan, and only to the same extent such service would be taken into
account under a comparable Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Closing.

  

  

(iv) Liabilities Following Closing. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any
Liabilities arising out of the employment or termination of employment of any
the Company Employees following the Closing, including lawsuits, actions,
claims or proceedings and accrued obligations for salaries, wages and other
compensation payable after the Closing, personal days and floating holidays
and sick pay of such the Company Employees and any Liabilities arising under,
in connection with or in respect of the Employee Benefit Plans provided that
if such lawsuits, actions, claims or proceedings, Liabilities and accrued
obligations arose out of the termination of the employment of the Company
Employees prior to Closing, Seller shall hold Buyer free and harmless from any
Adverse Consequences thereof.

  

  

(v) Retirement Plan. Within three (3) months from Closing, the Seller shall
cause the Company to establish its own retirement plan separate from that of
Lexmark Research and Development Corporation and the corresponding
contributions of the Company pertaining to its officers and employees under
the Pension Plan dated November 11, 2004 and subject to the Trust Agreement
dated November 22, 2004 shall be segregated from the common fund and
transferred by the Company to such retirement plan. The amount of
corresponding contributions related to the Company shall be equal to 77% of
the entire amount of assets in the Pension Plan.

  

  

(d) Confidentiality. Unless required by law or the rules and regulations of
any securities exchange (in which case each of Buyer and Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party prior to any such
disclosure as to the form and content of such disclosure), from and after the
date hereof, no press releases, announcements to the employees, customers or
suppliers of the Business or other releases of information related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will be issued or released
without the prior consent of both Buyer and Seller. Seller and Buyer agree to
keep the terms of this Agreement confidential, except to the extent required
by applicable law or the rules and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22

and except that the parties may disclose such terms to their respective
employees, accountants, advisors and other representatives as necessary in
connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long
as such Persons agree to or are bound by contract to keep the terms of this
Agreement confidential). The Confidentiality Agreement between Seller and
Buyer dated September of 2012 shall remain in full force and effect pursuant
to its terms.

 

  

  

(e) Notice to PEZA. Seller shall notify the PEZA of the transfer of the Shares
within 30 days from the Closing Date.

  

  

(f) Change of Company Name. Within one (1) year from Closing, Buyer shall
change the Company name to exclude the word "Lexmark" from the Company name.

  

  

(g) Further Actions. In case at any time after the Closing any further action
is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall take such further action (including the execution and
delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party
reasonably may request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting
Party.

11  

  

 

 

  

  

are actively engaged as independent contractors and are not on any sort of

employee intends to, or is considering, terminating, such employee's
employment with Sellers, including in connection with or as a result of, in
part or in whole, of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(e) Employee Benefits. Schedule 3(e) contains a complete and accurate list of
all Employee Benefit Plans sponsored, maintained or participated in by Sellers
with respect to the Leased Employees (or beneficiary or dependent thereof), or
to which Sellers are contributing or have contributed (or have or had any
obligation to contribute), on behalf of any Leased Employee (or their
beneficiaries or dependents) within the last three (3) years or under which
Sellers have any present or future Liability with respect to any Leased
Employee (or beneficiary or dependent thereof).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Each such Employee Benefit Plan (and each related trust, insurance
contract, or fund) has been maintained, funded and administered in all

and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement and complies
in form and in operation in all material respects with the applicable

communicated to any employee of Sellers.

  

  

(v) (A) Each Employee Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified within
the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and either (x) has a
current favorable determination letter as to its qualification, or (y) is in
the form of a prototype, master or volume submitter plan document that has a
current opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service stating that the
language of the plan document meets the qualification requirements of Section
401(a) of the Code and Sellers are entitled to rely on such letter, and, to
the Knowledge of Sellers, nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure
to act, that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification; (B) no event has occurred and no condition exists with respect
to any Employee Benefit Plan or any other current or former employee benefit
plan sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required to be contributed to by
Sellers, or any ERISA Affiliate of Sellers that could subject Buyer to any
Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other obligation imposed by ERISA, the Code or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

  

  

other applicable Laws; and (C) Sellers have not incurred any current or
projected liability in respect of post-employment or post-retirement health,

(f) Permits. Each of the Permits necessary to operate or use the Transferred
Assets in the manner in which they are currently operated is valid and in full
force and effect. Sellers have not received any written notice that remains
outstanding from any Governmental Body regarding any actual or proposed
revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation or termination (other than by
expiration) of any Permit. Except as set forth on Schedule 3(f), the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not materially adversely
affect Sellers' rights to utilize the Permits.

  

  

(g) Environmental Matters. Sellers have complied with all Environmental Laws
applicable to the Transferred Equipment. There are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, threatened claims or Liens resulting from any
Environmental, Health, and Safety Liability or arising under or pursuant to
any Environmental Law, with respect to or affecting any of the Transferred
Assets to be sold, transferred, assigned and conveyed pursuant hereto. There
are no Hazardous Materials present on or in respect of the Transferred
Equipment.

  


 

  

(h) Major Suppliers. Schedule 3(h) sets forth each Major Supplier. Except as
set forth in Schedule 3(h), no Major Supplier has given Sellers any notice
(written or oral) terminating, canceling, reducing the volume under, or
renegotiating the pricing terms or any other material terms of any Contract
with each of them or relationship with Sellers or threatening to take any of
such actions, and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no Major Supplier intends to
do so.

warranties contained in this Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement,

transferred, assigned and conveyed hereunder, except otherwise set forth in
the Transaction Agreement;

  

  

(b) keep in full force and effect, without amendment, all the rights and
obligations to the Material Contracts assigned by Sellers and assumed by Buyer
under Sections 2(a) and 2(c);

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) comply with all applicable Legal Requirements applicable to the
Transferred Equipment; and

  


 

  

(d) except as required to comply with Legal Requirements applicable to the
Acquired Employees, not amend, modify or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan
for any Acquired Employee and not make any additional contributions to any
such Employee Benefit Plan.

  


 

  

Section 5. Post-Closing Covenants. The Parties agree as follows with respect
to the period following the Closing.

  

  

(a) Employees.

  

  

(i) For the first eighteen (18) months after the Closing (the "Service
Period"), Sellers shall designate up to twenty-eight (28) employees or
independent contractors whose primary responsibilities are or have been in
connection with providing services to the Business, chosen in consultation
with Buyer and subject to the approval of Buyer as set forth in the Transition
Services Agreement (such employees and independent contractors, the "Leased
Employees"). The Leased Employees shall be employed by Sellers as employees or
contractors and provide temporary services to Buyer during the Service Period
in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement. Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer shall have the right during and after the Service Period to make
conditional offers for "at will" regular employment to any or all Leased
Employees. "Regular Employment" means at-will employment of an indefinite and
unspecified duration. Leased Employees who accept such offer of Regular
Employment and become regular employees of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer are
referred to as "Acquired Employees." Sellers have no plans or intent to
terminate additional employees in connection with or as a result, in part or
in whole, of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Buyer shall have
no obligations or responsibilities to offer employment to or hire any
specific, individual employee of Sellers. Sellers acknowledge that they are
solely responsible for satisfying all obligations and liabilities in
connection with Sellers' employment and termination of the Leased Employees
and the Leased Employees who become the Acquired Employees and all employment
matters relating to the Acquired Employees, including: the payment of all
wages and any accrued (or accumulated) and unused vacation pay, sick pay and
any other paid time off through the earlier of (a) the last day of the Service
Period or (b) such time they are hired by Buyer as Acquired Employees, or
other compensation due and owing to them as of the earlier of (x) the last day
of the Service Period or (y) such time they are hired by Buyer as Acquired
Employees, all Taxes and withholding, the providing of workers' compensation
coverage, and any notice due, including under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"), unemployment compensation coverage and
all obligations and liabilities arising under the Employee Benefit Plans and
the continuation of currently existing fringe benefit programs for the
Acquired Employees. As of the last day of the Service Period, or at the time
Buyer makes an offer of employment, all of the Leased Employees identified by
Buyer on Schedule 5(a)(i) shall be free of all employment obligations to
Sellers and will be free to become employees of Buyer at Buyer's option.
Except as otherwise provided in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

  

  

Section 5(a), Buyer shall be responsible for all employment-related
obligations with respect to the Acquired Employees arising from regular
employment with Buyer.

 

  

  

(ii) Sellers shall be responsible for all employment-related obligations with
respect to Leased Employees, including salaries, payroll Taxes, employee
benefits, fees, and other charges or insurance required by Law including
unemployment Taxes, Social Security contributions, workers' compensation
premiums, and all similar Taxes and payments during the Service Period (or
until such Leased Employees are hired by Buyer as Acquired Employees);
provided, however, that Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any and all such
costs, expenses and payments arising out of the employment of such Leased
Employees during the Service Period in accordance with the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement. Sellers shall comply in all material respects
with all employment-related Laws and shall not discriminate because of race,
color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability or other status
protected by Law. Buyer is not, and will not be deemed to be a party to any
collective bargaining agreement to which Sellers was, is, or may become a
party.

  

  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sellers shall
be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold Buyer, its directors,
officers and employees harmless from (i) any employment-related Liability
arising from this Agreement, including Liability under the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), or WARN (ii)
all claims, liabilities and Losses (including court costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees and consultants' fees) relating to or arising out of any claim
or allegation that Buyer is, or is deemed to be, an employer or joint
employer; for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer reserves the right to control the
defense of such claims, and (iii) any Liability for paid time off with respect
to any of Sellers' employees or contractors. For such time that there exists
any Liability under COBRA with respect to any employees or former employees of
Sellers (and spouses and dependents thereof), Sellers shall maintain all group
health plans under which such Liabilities exist and shall be solely
responsible for all COBRA obligations to such individuals arising under
Sellers' Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(iv) Bonus Payments.

  

  

(A) Sellers shall pay each Leased Employee (other than the independent
contractors) a bonus equal to three (3) months of such Leased Employee's most
recent base salary with Sellers, within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date.

  

  

(B) In the event that any Leased Employee becomes an Acquired Employee,
Sellers shall pay to such Acquired Employee (other than Acquired Employees who
were independent contractors when they were Leased Employees) a bonus equal to
three (3) months of such Acquired Employee's most recent base salary with
Sellers as of the time that such Leased Employee becomes an Acquired Employee,
within sixty (60) days after the date on which such Leased Employee becomes an
Acquired Employee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(C) In the event that any Acquired Employee remains employed by Buyer for one
year, promptly upon the year anniversary of such Acquired Employee's being
hired by Buyer, Buyer shall pay to each such Acquired Employee (other than
Acquired Employees who were independent contractors when they were Leased
Employees) a bonus equal to three (3) months of such Acquired Employee's then
applicable base salary. Such bonuses shall be payable so long as the Acquired
Employee (a) is still employed by Buyer at the time such payment becomes due
and payable, (b) is terminated other than for Cause, or (c) terminates his or
her employment for Good Reason. In the event that the Acquired Employee is
terminated other than for Cause, or terminates his or her employment for Good
Reason prior to his or her one year anniversary with Buyer, Buyer shall pay
such bonus promptly after the termination of such Acquired Employee's
employment.

  

  

(D) Sellers shall inform the Leased Employees of the above referenced bonuses
in writing prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(v) Sellers agree that beginning on the date of Regular Employment with Buyer
and continuing until the second anniversary of such date of employment,
without the written permission of Buyer, unless such Acquired Employee was
terminated by Buyer, Sellers shall not employ any Acquired Employee either as
an employee, contractor or consultant, and Sellers shall not cause or permit
any employee or Affiliate of Sellers to, directly or indirectly, hire or
solicit for hire as an employee, contractor or consultant, any Acquired
Employee or otherwise persuade or cause any such Acquired Employee to
discontinue working for Sellers. Sellers agree that the covenants and
agreements contained herein are, taken as a whole, fair and reasonable in
their scope and duration, and Sellers shall not raise any issue of the
reasonableness of the scope or duration of any such covenants in any
Proceeding to enforce any such covenants.

  

  

(vi) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5(a) or as otherwise
required by applicable Law, all Acquired Employees shall cease to participate
in or accrue further benefits under the Employee Benefit Plans at the last day
of the Service Period (or on the date hired by Buyer, if prior to the end of
the Service Period). Sellers shall cause the Acquired Employees to be fully
vested in their accrued Lexmark Savings Plan and Retirement Growth Account
Plan benefits, as applicable, as of the last day of the Service Period. Any
Acquired Employee with an outstanding participant loan under the Lexmark
Savings Plan shall be eligible to rollover their outstanding participate loan
to any eligible Tax-qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of the Code
that will accept such direct rollover.

  

  

(vii) From the commencement of each Acquired Employee's regular employment
with Buyer, Buyer shall make available to such Acquired Employee such benefits
plans and arrangements, if any, it deems appropriate in its sole discretion.

  

  

(viii) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5(a), with respect to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

  

  

Acquired Employees, (A) Buyer shall have no obligation with respect to any
current or former employees of Sellers (and dependent or beneficiary thereof)
and (B) nothing in this Agreement confers upon any Acquired Employee or other
employee of Sellers any rights or remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

  

  

(ix) If an Acquired Employee has met the eligibility requirements for retiree
medical, vision, dental and life insurance benefits (collectively, "Retiree
Benefits") under the Employee Benefit Plans as of the last day of the Service
Period, the Acquired Employee's employment by Buyer (or an Affiliate thereof)
and coverage under benefit plans of Buyer (or an Affiliate thereof) will not
cause the Acquired Employees to forfeit any Retiree Benefits under the
Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(b) Facilities. During the Service Period, Sellers shall provide free of
charge necessary work space for the Leased Employees and Buyer personnel
within Sellers' existing facilities to conduct the Business; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Sellers shall not
be required to provide a "clean room" for the Business, Leased Employees,
Buyer personnel, or otherwise. Further, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for any pre-
approved cost of materials and travel expenses relating to Buyer personnel in
accordance with the Transition Services Agreement.

  

  

(c) Material Contracts. Sellers shall use their commercially best efforts to
obtain consents to the assigned rights to the Material Contracts under Section
2(a)(ii) and (viii) which have not yet been obtained as of the Closing, or if
not feasible, to assist Buyer in entering into with the Major Suppliers new
Contracts on terms that are no less favorable to those of Contracts with the
Major Suppliers.

  

  

(d) Delivery of Transferred Equipment. Sellers shall be responsible for all
costs associated with moving (but not the set-up or installation of)
Transferred Equipment held by Sellers or their agents in the People's Republic
of China (P.R.C.) (including all Transferred Equipment held as of the Closing
Date at Foxlink facilities or by Foxlink companies) to such other location(s)
in the P.R.C. designated by Buyer.

  

  

(e) Future Product. Buyer agrees that, in the event it develops and/or
commercializes any Future Product, Buyer will make such Future Product
available to Sellers on commercially reasonable terms that are at least as
favorable as the terms offered to any other purchaser or potential purchaser
of such Future Product.

  

  


 

  

Section 6. Miscellaneous.

  

  

(a) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not confer any rights
or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties, the Affiliates and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

(b) Insurance.

  

  

(i) Sellers will provide, or cause to be provided, workers' compensation

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18

liability insurance shall be provided for each accident for bodily injury by
accident and $1,000,0000 USD each employee for bodily injury by disease. Where
permitted by Law, such policies shall contain waivers of the insurer's right
of subrogation against Buyer, its subsidiaries, officers, directors and
employees. Additionally, Sellers will carry comprehensive general liability
insurance and commercial general liability insurance in the amounts of
$1,000,000 USD per occurrence and Buyers, its subsidiaries, officers,
directors and employees shall be named as "Additional Insureds" under the
policy. Sellers agree to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates against all
damages sustained by Buyer or its Affiliates resulting from Seller's failure
to have such coverage and from all claims by Sellers' employees or contractors
against Buyer arising out of or in connection with the performance of work
under the Transaction Documents, except to the extent such claims are
attributable to the sole negligence of Buyer, its Affiliates or employees.

Buyer agrees to indemnify Sellers against all damages sustained by Sellers
resulting from Buyer's failure to have such coverage and from all claims by

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

  

  

This Transition Services Agreement (this "Agreement") dated April 2, 2013
(Japan Standard Time)(April 1, 2013 U.S. Eastern Daylight Time), is by and
among Lexmark International, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Lexmark"), Lexmark
International Technology, S.A., a Switzerland joint stock company ("LITSA" and
with Lexmark, each a "Seller" and together, the "Sellers") and Funai Electric
Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation ("Buyer").

  

  

WHEREAS, on the same date as this Agreement, Sellers entered into a Master
Inkjet Sale Agreement with Buyer (the "Master Agreement") pursuant to which
Sellers and Buyer agreed that Sellers shall sell, and Buyer shall purchase,
the business of the manufacture of certain inkjet printer cartridges and parts
of Sellers (the "Divestiture");

  

  

WHEREAS, the Divestiture will be effected by the execution and consummation
of: (i) a certain Share Purchase Agreement by and between Buyer and LITSA
dated the same date hereof (the "Share Purchase Agreement"); (ii) a certain
Asset Purchase Agreement by and among Buyer and Sellers dated the same date
hereof (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"); and (iii) a certain Intellectual
Property Assignment and License Agreement by and among Buyer and Sellers dated
the same date hereof (the "IP Agreement" and collectively with the Master
Agreement, the Share Purchase Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement, the
"Transaction Documents");

  

  

WHEREAS, Sellers and Buyer are entering into this Agreement, in accordance
with the Transaction Documents, to provide for certain transitional services
to be provided by Sellers to Buyer for a limited period of time.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements hereinafter contained, and in consideration of the execution and
performance of the Transaction Documents, the parties agree as follows:

  

  

1. Definitions. Unless the context otherwise requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the Master Agreement.

  

  

2. Provision of Transition Services and Leased Employees.

  

  

a. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from the Closing
Date through the end of the Leasing Period (as defined below), Sellers shall
provide to Buyer the services of each employee or independent contractor
listed on Exhibit A (who are hereinafter referred to as the "Leased
Employees"), who shall perform the services described on Exhibit A (the
"Transition Services"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Leasing Period"
means, for each Leased Employee, the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending at 11:59 p.m. ET on such date set forth next to such Leased Employee's
name under the column "Expiration Date" on Exhibit B or ending the date the
Leased Employee accepts Buyer's written offer of regular employment and
becomes an Acquired Employee as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. The
date on which the Leasing Period terminates with respect to each Leased
Employee is referred to in this Agreement as the "Lease Expiration Date." For
such time as any Leased

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

  

  

Employee is providing the Transition Services to Buyer under this Agreement,
such Leased Employees will remain employees or independent contractors of the
Sellers and shall not be deemed to be employees or independent contractors of
Buyer or its Affiliates for any purpose.

 

  


 

  

b. During the Leasing Period, the Leased Employees shall devote their full
time and energy to perform those functions and services, and at such
locations, as were performed by the Leased Employees for the benefit of
Sellers immediately prior to the Closing Date, or such other functions and
services as Buyer may reasonably request (the "Employee Services"). Neither
Sellers nor Buyer shall relocate any Leased Employee (other than due to an
unforeseen catastrophe or emergency) during the Leasing Period. In addition,
Buyer shall be responsible for providing reasonable staff to correspond with,
work along-side, and otherwise assist the Leased Employees for the purpose of
facilitating the transition contemplated hereunder.

  


 

  

c. For the Leasing Period, Sellers shall be solely responsible for paying the
Leased Employees' compensation through Sellers' payroll and the withholding
and payment of applicable taxes related to such employment. For the Leasing
Period, Sellers shall be solely responsible for the provision of all wages,
bonuses, commissions, and employee benefits, including severance and workers'
compensation. The Leased Employees shall be paid at the same rates that such
Leased Employees were receiving as of the date of this Agreement, subject to
any increases that may be made in the ordinary course of business of Sellers
after providing written notice to Buyer. All Leased Employees' payroll
withholding elections (such as those related to income taxes, qualified
retirement plans, group health and welfare plans, etc.) shall remain the same
during the Leasing Period as such elections were as of the date of this
Agreement, except to the extent a Leased Employee elects (in a manner
permitted to employees and plan participants generally) to change any such
election.

  


 

  

d. During the Leasing Period, each Leased Employee shall continue to be
eligible to participate in all employee benefit plans of Sellers (other than
Sellers' or any of its Affiliates' equity-based plans), as amended from time
to time (the "Benefit Plans"), that such Leased Employee was eligible to
participate in as of the date of this Agreement. Sellers shall be responsible
for operating and administering all of the Benefit Plans and all claims
incurred by Leased Employees pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
applicable Benefit Plans, including any requirements generally applicable to
the submission of claims under such plans.

  


 

  

e. Sellers shall be solely responsible for compliance with all operation,
administration and legal obligations in respect of the Leased Employees
relating to payroll and Benefit Plan matters covered under this Agreement.
Sellers shall bear sole responsibility to respond to any questions and
inquiries from federal, state, local and foreign agencies and other persons
regarding payroll and employment data and history relating to the Leased
Employees and concerning the Leasing Period or any prior period. In the event
Buyer becomes aware of any compliance-related issues or any questions or
inquiries from any person, Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers of such matters
and Sellers shall have the sole right and responsibility to respond thereto.
Sellers shall be solely responsible for all liabilities and obligations
arising under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended, (COBRA) during the Leasing Period and upon the termination of this
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

f. In consideration for providing the Leased Employees, Buyer shall pay to
Sellers the amount set forth on Exhibit A under the column "Charges" for each
such Leased Employee.

  

 

  

g. Sellers hereby agree that it shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and
its Affiliates, as the case may be, from and against any and all damages,
losses, claims, suits or other expenses (including any attorneys' fees)
(collectively, the "Losses") arising out of or resulting from the service
arrangement contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, any Losses
arising out of or resulting from any action taken or not taken by any Leased
Employee in connection with the provision of the Employee Services or
otherwise or any Losses as a result of a workers\' compensation claim or
injury to a Leased Employee and any claim that Leased Employees are employees
or Joint Employees of Buyer and its Affiliates; provided, however, that Seller
shall not be required to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates from and against
any Losses arising out of or resulting from: (a) any breach of this Agreement
by Buyer or its Affiliates (excluding, for the purposes of this proviso,
actions taken or not taken by the Leased Employees); or (b) the negligence or
willful misconduct of Buyers. This Section 2(g) shall survive termination of
this Agreement for any reason whatsoever.

  

  

h. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary included in this Agreement, Buyer
shall have the right to hire any of the Leased Employees (as defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement) from the Closing Date to the Expiration Date
applicable to such Leased Employee, and in the event that Buyer hires a
Service Employee, such Leased Employee shall no longer be considered a Leased
Employee under this Agreement.

  


 

  

i. To the extent that any of the RandD Leased Employees (as defined on Exhibit
A) create any intellectual property while providing Transition Services under
this Agreement that becomes the property of Sellers under any agreement with
such RandD Leased Employee, Sellers shall take any and all actions necessary to
assign any such intellectual property to Buyer.

  


 

  

(a) Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide
existing documentation related to the Divestiture and Transition Services as
may be requested by Buyer, including the documents requested in that
technology transfer spreadsheet previously delivered to Buyer and documents
related to installation of the Transferred Equipment (as defined in the Asset
Purchase Agreement) held as of the Closing Date at Foxlink facilities or by
Foxlink companies pursuant to Section 5(d) of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  

  


 

  

3. Term and Termination.

  

  

a. This Agreement terminates with respect to each Transition Service at 11:59
p.m. ET on the last day of the period of duration set forth for each
Transition Service on Exhibit A. The entire Agreement terminates automatically
at 11:59 p.m. ET on the last day of the longest period of duration set forth
on Exhibit A. To the extent that any Leased Employee does not become an
Acquired Employee on or prior to the termination or expiration of this
Agreement, Buyer shall not be responsible for any further obligations with
respect to the Leased Employees other than any obligations that arose prior to
the termination or expiration hereof.

  

  

b. A party may terminate this Agreement with respect to a particular
Transition Service upon giving the other party 15 days prior written notice if
the other party materially breaches any

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

  

  

term of this Agreement concerning that Transition Service and such breach is
not cured within the 15-day notice period. Subject to the immediately
preceding sentence, a party's termination of a particular Transition Service
shall not alleviate that party or the other party from their respective
obligations concerning all other Transition Services.

 

  

  

c. A party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety if the other party
becomes insolvent, is unable to pay its bills as they become due in the
ordinary course, or commits an act of bankruptcy under the United States
Bankruptcy Act or any other applicable bankruptcy or similar law, or files or
has filed against it, voluntarily or involuntarily, a petition in bankruptcy
or for reorganization or for the adoption of an arrangement or plan under the
United States Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy or similar law, or
procures or suffers the appointment of a receiver for any substantial portion
of its properties, or initiates or has initiated against it, voluntarily or
involuntarily, any act, process or proceeding under any insolvency law or
other statute or law providing for the modification or adjustment of the
rights of creditors.

  

  

d. Buyer, in its sole discretion, may terminate any single Transition Service
or group of

  

  

Transition Services upon 30 days written notice to Sellers.

  

  

e. The parties may terminate this entire Agreement, any single Transition
Service or a group of Transition Services by mutual written consent.

  

  

f. Each party reserves all other rights and remedies hereunder and as
otherwise permitted by law that have accrued at the date of termination of
this Agreement and does not waive any obligation of any party by reason of
termination of this Agreement.

  

  

4. Payment. Sellers shall invoice Buyer on a monthly basis in arrears for the Transition Services provided by it hereunder. Unless otherwise stated in this Agreement or in the exhibits that detail the Transition Services, all amounts payable under this Agreement by a party to the other are due and payable within 30 days of receipt of an invoice for the Transition Services rendered.

  

  

5. Cooperation. During the term of this Agreement, each party shall maintain an effective liaison and cooperative working relationship with the other party and its staff to ensure an orderly performance of the Transition Services. Each party shall timely respond to requests or inquiries of the other party.

  

  

6. Limited Warranty. SELLERS WARRANT THAT THEY HAVE THE FULL POWER AND AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO BUYER AND ITS AFFILIATES AND TO GRANT BUYER AND ITS AFFILIATES THE RIGHTS GRANTED HEREIN. SELLERS AFFIRM THAT THEY SHALL NOT DISCRIMINATE BECAUSE OF RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, SEX, AGE, NATIONAL ORIGIN, DISABILITY OR OTHER PROTECTED STATUS AS DEFINED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN THE RECRUITMENT, SELECTION, TRAINING, UTILIZATION, PROMOTION, TERMINATION OR OTHER EMPLOYMENT RELATED ACTIVITIES OF THE LEASED EMPLOYEES. BUYERS AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING SELLERS' COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE LAWS. SELLERS OTHERWISE PROVIDE THE EMPLOYEE SERVICES AND THE TRANSITION SERVICES WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, WARRANTY OF FITNESS

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND WARRANTY ARISING BY USAGE OF TRADE, COURSE OF
DEALING, OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE.

  

  

7. Liability. SELLERS SHALL ONLY BE LIABLE FOR LOSSES CAUSED TO BUYER ARISING FROM THE FAILURE TO OBSERVE THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR AS A RESULT OF WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR ACTS OF NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART OF SELLERS. THIS AGREEMENT IS ENTERED INTO ON THE EXPRESS CONDITION THAT EXCEPT FOR ITS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, SELLERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR, OR SUFFER LOSS BY REASON OF, INJURY OR DEATH TO PERSON OR PROPERTY, FROM WHATEVER CAUSE, WHICH IN ANY WAY MAY BE CONNECTED WITH THE USE, CONDITION OR OCCUPANCY OF ANY PREMISES OWNED, LEASED OR OCCUPIED BY SELLERS OR THEIR AFFILIATES OR ANY PERSONAL PROPERTY LOCATED ON THE PREMISES OWNED, LEASED OR OCCUPIED BY SELLERS OR THEIR AFFILIATES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LIABILITY FOR INJURY TO ANY LEASED EMPLOYEE OR THE PERSON OR PROPERTY OF PURCHASER AND ITS RESPECTIVE AGENTS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, INVITEES, OR ANY OTHER PERSON. SELLERS SHALL NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE TRANSITION SERVICES OR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.

9. Notices. All notices permitted or required hereunder shall be given in the manner specified in the Master Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

10. Independent Contractor. The parties intend to create an independent contractor relationship, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to make either party or other respective employees a partner, joint venturer, principal, agent or employee of the other. Neither party shall have any right, power or authority, express or implied, to bind the other. Without limiting any other provision contained herein, Sellers shall employ, pay, supervise, control and discharge all of the Leased Employees and observe and perform all obligations applicable to it under applicable laws as the employer of the Leased Employees.

 

  

  

11. Delays. Any delay or inability of either party in complying with the terms hereof arising from unforeseeable causes beyond the reasonable control and without the fault or negligence of that party, including, but not restricted to, acts of God, acts of public enemy, acts of the government in either sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, or strikes, shall excuse any delay in the performance of that party other than any payment obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that the party failing to perform uses all reasonable diligence to remedy such failure as promptly as practicable and gives immediate written notice to the other of any delay, whether excusable as set forth above or otherwise, and shall fully inform the other party of the nature of the delay and the expected duration and consequences thereof. In the event of any delay resulting from or arising in connection with any of the above events, the periods of service provided in this Agreement shall be extended for the duration of such delay.

  

  

12. Confidentiality.

  

  

a. In the course of providing or receiving Transition Services under this
Agreement, each party (the "Receiving Party"), its Affiliates and their
respective employees, officers, agents and representatives may receive or have
access to Confidential Information of the other party (the "Disclosing
Party"). The Receiving Party, its Affiliates and their respective employees,
officers, agents and representatives shall use such Confidential Information
only in connection with the performance or receipt of Transition Services and
shall safeguard such Confidential Information against disclosure to all
others, both during the term of this Agreement and for a period of five years
after the final provision of Transition Services. The provisions of this
Section 12 are inoperative as to such portions of the Confidential Information
of a Disclosing Party which: (i) is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party, its
Affiliates or their respective employees, officers, agents or representatives;
or (ii) after the date of this Agreement, becomes available to the Receiving
Party on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than the Disclosing
Party or its Affiliates or their respective officers, agents and
representatives) which is entitled to disclose it. For the avoidance of doubt
and notwithstanding the terms of this Section 12, Buyer shall have the right,
after the Closing, to disclose Confidential Information regarding the Products
and the formulation thereof to toll blenders.

  

  

b. In the event that a Receiving Party or anyone to whom a Receiving Party
transmits the Confidential Information is requested or becomes legally
compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or
documents, subpoena, criminal or civil investigative demand or similar
process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information of a Disclosing
Party, or if a Receiving Party determines in its good faith judgment that
disclosure of a Disclosing Party's Confidential Information is required by law
or the rules of any applicable national stock exchange, the Receiving Party,
unless prohibited by applicable law, shall provide the Disclosing Party with
prompt written notice so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order
or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of
this Section 12, and the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

  

  

Receiving Party shall cooperate with the Disclosing Party in any effort the
Disclosing Party undertakes to obtain a protective order or other remedy. If
such a protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if the Disclosing
Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Section 12, the Receiving
Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party which is legally required and shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded the Confidential Information.

 

  

  

c. Each Receiving Party agrees that a Disclosing Party shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including temporary restraining orders, injunctions and
specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this
Section 12. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for
a breach of this Section 12 by a Receiving Party, its Affiliates or their
respective employees, officers, agents or representatives, but shall be in
addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.

  


 

  

13. Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder are not assignable or otherwise transferable by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, which it may grant or deny in its sole discretion. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

14. Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and do not limit or otherwise affect any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

15. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO DELAWARE'S CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.

  

  

16. Arbitration. All disputes or controversies arising out of or in connection with this Agreement that are not solved by means of good faith negotiations between the Parties during a thirty (30)-day period starting on the date one of the Parties notifies in writing the other Parties of any Dispute shall be resolved by an arbitration panel and settled under the Rules of Arbitration (the "Rules") of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") for the time being in force. The arbitration proceedings shall take place in New York, NY, where the arbitral award shall be rendered, and shall be conducted on a confidential basis in the English language. The arbitration panel shall be composed of three (3) arbitrators to be appointed in accordance with the Rules, one (1) of them appointed by Sellers and Buyer and the third (3rd) appointed by the other two (2) arbitrators. In the event the other two (2) arbitrators fail to appoint such third (3rd) arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days following their appointment, such third (3rd) arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICC. The arbitrators shall speak and write English fluently.

  

  

17. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be fully severable, and this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision never comprised a part of this Agreement and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Furthermore, in lieu of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there will be added automatically as part of this Agreement a provision as similar in its terms to the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

18. Entire Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, between the parties concerning this subject matter and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with regard to this subject matter. The parties have not relied upon any promises, representations, warranties, agreements, covenants or undertakings, other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement, except for the Transaction Documents.

 

  

  

19. Waiver. Waiver of the benefit of any provision of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought to be effective. The waiver by any party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement will be deemed to constitute a waiver by that party of compliance by the other party with any of the covenants or other obligations contained in this Agreement. A failure by a party to insist upon strict compliance with any term of this Agreement, enforce any right or seek any remedy upon any breach of any other party will not affect, or constitute a waiver of, that party\'s right to insist upon strict compliance, enforce that right or seek that remedy with respect to that default or any prior, contemporaneous or subsequent default.

  

  

20. Binding on Successors. This Agreement applies to and binds the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.

  

  

21. Amendments. No amendment of this Agreement is valid unless in writing and the party against whom enforcement is sought signs it.

  

  

22. Presumption. This Agreement or any section of this Agreement will not be construed against any party due to the fact that the party drafted this Agreement or any section of this Agreement.

  

  

23. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Execution of this Agreement via facsimile will be effective and signatures received via facsimile will be binding upon the parties and effective as originals. The parties expressly acknowledge that, notwithstanding any statutory or decisional law to the contrary, the printed product of a facsimile transmittal will be deemed to be "written" and a "writing" for all purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

24. Third Party Beneficiaries. The terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party to this Agreement and their respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties to confer third party beneficiary rights, and this Agreement does not confer any such rights, upon any other person or entity.

  

  

25. No Modification of Purchase Agreement. This Agreement does not and shall not be interpreted to modify any terms of the Transaction Documents or any party's obligations under the Transaction Documents.
