forth in Section 7.01, or, if on such day any condition set forth in Section
7.02 or 7.03 has not been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Applicable

Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall (i) specify in reasonable
detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted and (ii) only include
disagreements based on mathematical errors or based on the Adjustment Amount

Seller and Purchaser on the earlier of (A) the date Seller and Purchaser
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to the matters
specified by Purchaser in the Notice of Disagreement and (B) the date any
disputed matters are finally resolved by the Accounting Firm (as defined
below). During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified by
Purchaser in the Notice of Disagreement. At the end of such 30-day period,
Seller and Purchaser shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution any and all matters that were included by
Purchaser in the Notice of Disagreement and that remain in dispute. The
Accounting Firm shall be KPMG LLP or,

 



7  if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon in writing by

(c) In resolving matters submitted to it pursuant to Section 2.04(b), the
Accounting Firm (i) shall make its final determination on all matters within
90 days of its appointment; (ii) shall not hold any hearings; (iii) shall not
be entitled to take or order the taking of depositions or other testimony
under oath; and (iv) with respect to each matter submitted to it, shall

representation or warranty in this Agreement or (D) any determination as to
compliance by any party hereto with any of its covenants in this Agreement,
other than Section 2.04(h). Any determination by the Accounting Firm, and any
work or analyses performed by the Accounting Firm, may not be offered as
evidence in any suit, action or proceeding as evidence of a breach of Section
4.03, a breach of any other representation or warranty in this Agreement or a
breach of any covenant in this Agreement (other than a breach of this Section
2.04).

(e) The final determination by the Accounting Firm of the matters submitted to
it pursuant to Section 2.04(b) shall: (i) be in writing; (ii) include the
Accounting Firms calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price; (iii) include
the Accounting Firms determination of each matter submitted to it pursuant to
Section 2.04(b) and (iv) include the Accounting Firms calculation of
interest (in accordance with Section 2.04(g)) from and including the Closing
Date to but excluding the date of determination.

 

(f) The dispute resolution by the Accounting Firm under this Section 2.04
shall constitute an arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act, and the
Accounting Firm shall be an arbitrator. The arbitration shall have its seat in
New York, shall take place in New York City, shall be in the English language
and shall be governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association
to the extent not inconsistent with this Section 2.04. The determinations of
the Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and conclusive. Judgment may be
entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in 

 



8  New York State Supreme Court or any other court having jurisdiction over the
party against which such determination is to be enforced. The cost of any
dispute resolution (including the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
and reasonable attorney fees and expenses of the parties) pursuant to this
Section 2.04 shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in inverse proportion as
they may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm at
the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of
the matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of Sellers accounting
advisors incurred in connection with their review of the Statement and review
of any Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Seller, and the fees and
disbursements of Purchasers accounting advisors incurred in connection with
their review of the Statement and review of any Notice of Disagreement shall
be borne by Purchaser.

(g) The Purchase Price shall be increased or decreased by the amount of the
Adjustment Amount (the Purchase Price as so increased or decreased shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ "). If the
Closing Date Amount is less than the Adjusted Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall, and if the Closing Date Amount is more than the Adjusted
Purchase Price, Seller shall, within 10 business days after the Statement
becomes final and binding on the parties, make payment by wire transfer in
immediately available funds of the amount of such difference, together with
interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time
announced publicly by JPMorgan Chase, as its prime rate, calculated on the
basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365, from and including
the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04, no adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be made unless such adjustment (before
taking into account interest) would exceed $100,000; in such case the full
amount of the adjustment (plus interest) shall be made.

 

(h) In connection with the determination of the Adjustment Amount pursuant to
this Section 2.04:

 

(i) Seller shall cause the books and records of the Company as of the JV
Transfer Time to accurately reflect all information necessary for Purchaser
to verify the accuracy of the calculation of the Adjustment Amount, and shall
cause all such books and records to be in the possession of the Company at the
Closing.

 

(ii) During the 60 days following the Closing Date, the Company shall assist,
and shall cause the other JV Entities to assist, Seller in the preparation of
the Statement and shall provide Seller reasonable access to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the JV Entities for the purpose of preparing
the Statement.

any action with respect to the accounting books and records of the Company on
which the Statement is to be based that are not consistent with the Companys
past practices.

 



9 (iv) From the Closing Date through the resolution of any adjustment to
the Purchase Price contemplated by this Section 2.04, the Company shall
afford, and shall cause the other JV Entities to afford, to Seller and its

corresponding election under state, local, and foreign tax law) with respect
to the purchase and sale of the Company stock hereunder and the deemed
purchase and sale of stock of each of LeClair and Matoa (collectively, the "
_Section 338(h)(10) Election_ "). The AGA Consolidated Group and Seller, as

forms that are required to be submitted to any Taxing Authority in connection
with making the Section 338(h)(10) Election.

 

(b) The parties acknowledge that, for Federal income Tax purposes, Purchasers
acquisition of the Company Shares from Seller is to be treated as the
purchase by Purchaser from Seller of a 100% interest in the JV Assets (the "
_Purchased Assets_ ") and an assumption of 100% of the JV Liabilities (the "
_Assumed Liabilities_ "), determined as of the end of the day of Closing. The

(c) No later than 90 days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver

following receipt of the Allocation Schedule, Seller may give written notice
of any disagreement with the Allocation Schedule to Purchaser (the "
_Allocation Schedule Notice of Disagreement_ "), which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted. If an
Allocation Schedule Notice of Disagreement is received by Purchaser in a
timely manner, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve

valuation firm to render a third party opinion, the parties are still unable
to reach a mutually acceptable allocation, each party may use the allocation
that it determines to be appropriate.

 



11 (d) If the parties agree upon the Allocation Schedule (as revised in
accordance with Section 2.05(c), if applicable), each party shall file
Internal Revenue Service Form 8883, and all Federal, state, local and foreign
Tax Returns, in accordance with the Allocation Schedule (as revised in
accordance with Section 2.05(c), if applicable). Each party shall promptly

If the parties agree upon the Allocation Schedule (as revised in accordance
with Section 2.05(c), if applicable), the parties shall report the Tax
consequences of the Transactions in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Schedule, and shall not take any action or position inconsistent therewith on
any Tax Return or in any Tax Proceeding except to the extent required
by Applicable Law relating to Taxes, including a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

SECTION 2.06. _Section 336(e) Election_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, if, before the Tax Returns for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period are filed, Seller notifies Purchaser that, because
Purchasers acquisition of the Company Shares is not a "qualified stock
purchase" within the meaning of Section 338 of the Code or for any other
reason, then the parties agree to make an election under Section 336(e) of the
Code with respect to the acquisition of the Company Shares and the deemed
purchase and sale of stock of each of LeClair and Matoa (collectively, a "

(c) Purchaser shall promptly advise Seller in writing of (i) any notice or
communication from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
any notice or communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) any material Proceeding commenced
or threatened against it, which could reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect and (iv) any failure by it to comply with or
satisfy in all material respects any covenant, condition 

 



33  or agreement to be complied with or satisfied under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any such notice shall not cure
any breach of, or non-compliance with, any provision of this Agreement or
limit the remedies available to Seller under this Agreement.

(d) Except for matters expressly permitted or required by the terms of this
Agreement, from the date of this Agreement to the Closing, Seller and AGA-USA

and to the personnel properties, books, contracts, commitments, Tax Returns
and records of or pertaining to the JV Entities, the JV Assets and the Assumed
JV Liabilities, and, during such period shall furnish promptly to Purchaser
any information concerning a JV Entity, JV Asset or Assumed JV Liability as
Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access
does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the JV Entities and
applicable AGA Subsidiaries.

SECTION 6.03. _Confidentiality_. (a) Purchaser acknowledges that the
information being provided to it in connection with the Transactions is
subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and

the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information
relating solely to the JV Entities.

 

(b) AGA shall, within 30 days after the Closing Date, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each recipient (other than its representatives
and advisors) of evaluation materials distributed in connection with the
proposed sale or other disposition of, or joint venture involving, the Company
which is party to a confidentiality agreement with AGA with respect to
such evaluation materials, to destroy or return such evaluation materials to

shall not be required to take any judicial or arbitral action in connection
with this Section 6.03(b).

shall, and shall cause its respective affiliates to, exercise its reasonable
best efforts to promptly obtain all Consents and Governmental Approvals
required in connection with the consummation of the Transactions under the
Permits set forth on Schedule 4.09, including, in the case of any such Permit
held by any AGA Subsidiary, consent to the transfer of such Permit to
Purchaser, the Company or such other affiliate of Purchaser as may
be designated by Purchaser.

(c) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than ten business days following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the
notification and report form, if any, required for the Transactions and any
supplemental information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR
Act. Any such notification and report form and supplemental information shall
be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Purchaser
shall be solely responsible for any filing fees payable under the HSR Act.
Each of Seller and Purchaser shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the
HSR Act. Seller and Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of the status of
any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the FTC and the DOJ and shall comply promptly
with any such inquiry or request. Each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the
consummation of the Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser
and its affiliates shall not be required to (i) divest or otherwise dispose
of, or hold separate, all or any portion of any mine, production facility or
other asset or the operations of any such mine, production facility or other
asset or (ii) agree or become subject to any limitations on their rights to
control, operate or exercise the full rights of ownership of such assets or
operations, including, in each case, the assets and operations of the JV
Entities from and after the Closing.

(d) AGA shall as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than
ten business days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
file an application with the South African Reserve Bank in order to obtain its
approval, in accordance with the Exchange Control Regulations of the Republic
of South Africa, for the Acquisition. Seller shall keep Purchaser apprised of
any communications following submission of the aforementioned application with
the South African Reserve Bank. AGA shall use its reasonable best efforts to

Acquisition.

SECTION 6.05. _Expenses_. Whether or not the Closing takes place, and except
as set forth in Sections 2.04, 6.08, 8.02 and 10.03 and Article IX, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and the Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, including all costs and expenses incurred pursuant to
Section 6.04.

 



35 SECTION 6.06. _Brokers or Finders_. Each of Purchaser and Seller represents,
as to itself and its affiliates, that no agent, broker, investment banker or
other firm or person is or will be entitled to any brokers or finders fee or
any other commission or similar fee in connection with any of the
Transactions, except, as to Seller, BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., whose fees and
expenses will be paid by Seller and, as to Purchaser and its affiliates,
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., whose fees and expenses will be paid by
Purchaser.

 

SECTION 6.07. _Employee and Benefit Matters_. (a) _Continuation of
Compensation and Benefits._ Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
establish, or shall allow the Company Employees to participate in, employee
compensation and benefit plans (such plans, the " _Purchaser Benefit Plans_ ")
for the benefit of the Company Employees that provide compensation and
benefits in accordance with this Section 6.07. The parties acknowledge and
agree that the Company Employees shall continue to participate in the Seller
Benefit Plans through immediately prior to the Closing Date, and shall cease
all active participation in the Seller Benefit Plans as of the Closing Date.
For the period commencing on the Closing and ending on December 31, 2015 (the
" _Continuation Period_ ") or until the date of a Company Employees
termination of employment, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its affiliates to,
provide each Company Employee with a Comparable Position and Specified
Compensation and Benefits. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Comparable Position_ " means a position that is substantially comparable to
the type of position held by such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date (it being understood that changes to everyday work assignments,
shifts, and other position-related changes made in the ordinary course of
business shall not affect the substantially comparable nature of the type of
position), at a geographic location that is within the greater of (1) 35
straight-line miles of the Company Employees home and (2) the distance from
the Company Employees home and place of work immediately prior to the Closing
Date. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Specified Compensation and Benefits_
" shall mean: (a) salary, commission and cash bonus opportunities that, in
each case, are no less favorable to such Company Employee than those in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (b) employee benefit plans and
arrangements under the Purchaser Benefit Plans (other than salary,
commission, cash bonus opportunities, non-executive change in control plans,
and equity and equity based compensation plans and arrangements) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Purchaser (which shall include immediate participation
by the Company Employees in the applicable Purchasers medical plan, severance
plans, 401(k) plan and defined benefit pension plan for similarly situated
employees of Purchaser effective as of the Closing Date, and as further
described in this Section 6.07) . Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or
restrict Purchaser from modifying or amending the terms and conditions of
employment of any Company Employee (including the terms and conditions of any
benefit plan or arrangement covering any Company Employee after the Closing
Date), subject to this Section 6.07(a) and Section 6.07(c).

(b) _Credited Service._ With respect to each Purchaser Benefit Plan (including
any vacation, paid time-off and severance plan), for all purposes, including
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, and
benefit accruals, each

 



36  Company Employees service with Seller, the Company, the JV Entities or any
of their subsidiaries prior to the Closing (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of such employers, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer is recognized by Seller or such subsidiary or under the
comparable Seller Benefit Plan), shall be treated as service with Purchaser,
the Company and its affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service
need not be recognized for purposes of benefit accrual under qualified or
nonqualified defined benefit pension plans or to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. Seller shall provide
Purchaser all data necessary for Purchaser to carry out its obligations under
this paragraph, and shall use reasonable best efforts to do so in a format
reasonably requested by Purchaser.

 

(c) _Severance._ Salaried Company Employees shall be eligible to participate
in the severance benefit plans and arrangements of Purchaser to the same
extent and at the same benefit levels (after taking into account any service
crediting under Section 6.07(b)) as similarly situated employees of Purchaser,
and Purchaser hereby agrees not to terminate or adversely modify
such severance benefit plans and arrangements with respect to Company
Employees for a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, salaried Company Employees set forth on
Schedule 6.07(c)(1) shall be entitled to severance benefits upon termination
without cause or termination for "good reason" within twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date pursuant to the formula set forth on Schedule
6.07(c)(1) (after taking into account any service crediting under Section
6.07(b)). For purposes of the preceding sentence, "good reason" shall mean any
of the following: (i) the Company Employee is asked to relocate to a principal
place of employment outside of a 35 mile radius of the Company Employees
prior position, or (ii) the Company Employee is not provided the same or
higher annual base salary and cash bonus opportunity, or (iii) the Company
Employee suffers a material diminution of job duties, authority, or
responsibility resulting in a reduction in job grading level of at least 1
grade level in Purchasers job grading system. Hourly Company Employees whose
employment is involuntarily terminated by Purchaser or any of its affiliates
(including the Company) without cause within twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date shall be entitled to severance benefits from Purchaser or its
applicable affiliate in accordance with Schedule 6.07(c)(2) (after taking
into account any service crediting under Section 6.07(b)). For purposes of
clarity, Seller and Purchaser intend that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement should not constitute a separation, termination or severance of
employment of any Company Employee prior to or upon the occurrence of the
Closing, including for purposes of any severance benefit plan, program,
policy, agreement or arrangement of Seller in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and Seller and Purchaser intend that the Company Employees will
have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately before and
immediately after the Closing.

 

(d) _Tax-Qualified Savings/401(k) Plan._ Without limiting any other provision
of this Section 6.07, with respect to the Purchaser Benefit Plan that is a
defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (" _Purchaser s
401(k) Plan_"), Purchasers 401(k) Plan shall be effective as of the Closing.
Each Company Employee participating in the Seller Benefit Plan which includes
a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the

 



37  meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code providing benefits to the Company
Employees prior to the Closing (" _Seller s 401(k) Plan_") shall become a
participant in Purchasers 401(k) Plan as of the Closing. As soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, Seller and its affiliates shall cause
to be transferred from the Sellers 401(k) Plan to Purchasers 401(k) Plan the
assets and Liabilities relating to the account balances of the Company
Employees (whether vested or unvested as of the Closing Date), including any
promissory notes evidencing any outstanding loans in respect of the Company
Employees under the Sellers 401(k) Plan, in accordance with Applicable Law,
including the Code (the " _Seller 401(k) Transfer_ "). From and after the
Seller 401(k) Transfer, Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to
administer the accounts of the Company Employees in the Purchasers 401(k)
Plan in accordance with Applicable Law, including the Code. Purchaser shall
direct the trustee of the Purchasers 401(k) Plan to accept the Seller 401(k)
Transfer from the Sellers 401(k) Plan. Following the Seller 401(k) Transfer,
Purchaser and Purchasers 401(k) Plan shall assume Liability to the Company
Employees and their beneficiaries for payment of the account balances
transferred in connection with the Seller 401(k) Transfer, and Seller and
its affiliates and the Sellers 401(k) Plan shall have no Liability for any
costs, expenses or damages that may result from any claim in respect of such
account balances transferred in connection with the Seller 401(k) Transfer.

 

(e) _Certain Welfare Benefits Matters._ Without limiting any other provision
of this Section 6.07, with respect to any Purchaser Benefit Plan that
provides life insurance, health care, dental care, accidental death and
dismemberment insurance, disability and other group welfare benefits for the
Company Employees (the " _Purchaser Welfare Plans_ "), Purchaser shall cause
the Purchaser Welfare Plans to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees and their
dependents and beneficiaries under the Purchaser Welfare Plans to the extent
satisfied or waived under the applicable corresponding Seller Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) waive for a period of six months, or
until the end of the calendar year in which Closing occurs, whichever occurs
first, any employee contribution to any medical insurance premium otherwise
paid by Purchaser or Purchasers employees; and (iii) provide each Company
Employee and his or her dependents with credit for any out-of-pocket expenses
and deductibles paid prior to the Closing in the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any Purchaser Welfare Plans in which such Company
Employee participates after the Closing. Without limiting the scope of Section
6.07(g), Purchaser shall assume all Liabilities and obligations of Seller and
its affiliates to the Company Employees and their dependents in respect of
health insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ ") and similar state and local law.

 

(f) _Accrued Vacation._ For purposes of determining the number of vacation
days to which each Company Employee shall be entitled during the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall assume and honor all
vacation days accrued or earned but not yet taken by such Company Employee as
of the Closing. To the extent that a Company Employee is or becomes entitled
to be paid for any such

 



38  vacation days accrued or earned but not yet taken by such Company Employee
from and after the Closing, the Company shall discharge the liability for such
vacation days. Nothing in the preceding paragraph shall modify or amend
Purchasers vacation or paid time off policies or prohibit Purchaser from
providing for a rollover of accrued but unused vacation days in accordance
with such policies.

 

(g) _Transfer and Assumption of Employee and Benefit Plan Liabilities_.
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, assume any and all
employment (including under any applicable Law relating to employment
practices or the employment of labor), compensation, employee benefit and
employee benefit plan Liabilities (including salary, wage, bonus, incentive,
management retention, deferred compensation, retirement and welfare benefit
plan Liabilities) with respect to each Company Employee (or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof) or any consultant or independent contractor of the
Company or any JV Entity, regardless of whether accrued, incurred or
otherwise related to periods prior to, on or following the Closing Date, other
than (i) any Liabilities with respect to the Company Employees pursuant to the
AngloGold Ashanti Limited Bonus Share Plan 2005, as amended, and the
AngloGold Ashanti Limited Long Term Incentive Plan 2005, as amended, (ii)
Liabilities under the Seller Benefit Plans to the extent payable under
contracts of insurance or other funding vehicles used to fund or
provide benefits under such Seller Benefit Plans, (iii) Liabilities under the
Seller Benefit Plans resulting from a material breach of Applicable Law, a
material breach of any plan document, insurance contract, or plan
administrative contract, or a material failure to pay insurance premiums when
due, (iv) Liabilities for self-funded medical, dental, vision and flexible
spending account claims incurred prior to the Closing Date, and (v)
Liabilities for which Purchaser would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Article IX hereof (such assumed Liabilities, the "
_Assumed Employee Liabilities_ "). Except as provided in Section 6.07(d),
Seller and its affiliates shall not transfer, or cause to be transferred, to
Purchaser any employee benefit plan assets, insurance policies or other
funding vehicles that are attributable to the Assumed Employee Liabilities or
otherwise. Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its affiliates and each of their
respective directors, officers, and employees from, (i) all Assumed Employee
Liabilities that may result in respect of any claims made by any Company
Employees for any Assumed Employee Liabilities, and (ii) any claims or
Liabilities arising out of, relating to or in connection with any failure by
Purchaser or any of its affiliates to comply with any of its obligations set
forth in this Section 6.07 from and after the Closing. Seller shall retain
all liabilities with respect to the Company Employees pursuant to the
AngloGold Ashanti Limited Bonus Share Plan 2005, as amended, and the AngloGold
Ashanti Limited Long Term Incentive Plan 2005, as amended (which for
avoidance of doubt shall require Seller to pay to the applicable Company
Employees all amounts accrued for periods prior to the Closing Date (including
for the period between January 1, 2015 and the Closing Date), in accordance
with the rules of such plan, regardless of whether such amounts are earned
and vested under such plans as of the Closing Date).

(h)  _Communications._ Any communications proposed to be delivered by
Purchaser to any Company Employee before the Closing regarding the matters
contained in or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise
respecting 

 



39  any changes or potential changes in employee benefit plans, practices or
procedures that may or will occur in connection with the Transactions shall be
subject to the prior approval of Seller. 

(i) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ Notwithstanding any other provision herein
to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement shall (a) be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement, (b) limit the ability of Purchaser
or any of its affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit
or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement at
any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them or (c)
create any third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any Company Employee) other than the
parties hereto or any right to employment or continued employment or to a
particular term or condition of employment with Purchaser or any of its
affiliates.

 

SECTION 6.08. _Tax Matters_. (a) _Straddle Period_. With respect to each JV
Entity, in the case of any Straddle Period, (i) the amount of any Income Tax
and other Taxes not described in subsection (ii) for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date and (ii) in the case of other Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis with respect to such JV Entity or its assets, or
otherwise not feasibly allocated to specific transactions or events, shall be
determined based on the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire Straddle Period.

 

(b) _Tax Periods Ending on or before the Closing Date_. After the Closing
Date, Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the JV Entities for all periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, the due date of which (taking into account valid
extensions of time to file) is after the Closing Date (such Tax Returns, the "
_JV Entity Returns_ ") but only if not filed prior to the Closing Date. All
JV Entity Returns shall be prepared consistent with the past practice of the
JV Entities, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law. Purchaser shall
have the right to review and comment on such JV Entity Returns and Seller
shall, upon Purchasers request, reflect such comments from Purchaser on such
JV Entity Returns to the extent such comments are reasonable and consistent
with the standard set forth in the previous sentence; _provided_ , _however_
, that for any unitary Tax Returns, including the AGA Consolidated Groups
consolidated Tax Return, only that portion related to the JV Entities shall be
provided to the Purchaser. Seller shall cause the applicable JV Entity to
timely file all the JV Entity Returns.

(c) _Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any Tax refunds that are received by a JV
Entity or by Purchaser with respect to a JV Entity, and any amounts credited
against Tax in lieu of a Tax refund to which any JV Entity or Purchaser
becomes entitled, that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods but only if
attributable to Taxes paid by Seller or the JV Entities prior to the Closing
or Taxes indemnified by Seller hereunder, shall be for the account of Seller.
The JV Entities and Purchaser shall pay over to Seller any such refund

 



40  or the amount of any such credit, minus any costs and expenses from the
receipt or payment of such amount, within 15 days after receipt of such Tax
refund or reduction in any Tax payments attributable to such Tax credit.

(d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(i) The Company, Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation, or other proceeding
(including the provision of powers of attorney) and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Purchaser and Seller agree
(and Purchaser and Seller agree to cause the JV Entities) (A) to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to each JV Entity
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Purchaser, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and allow Seller to take
possession of such books and records.

 

(ii) The Company, Purchaser and Seller further agree, upon request and at the
requesting partys sole cost and expense, to use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that would be imposed (including with respect to
the Transactions).

(e) _Tax-Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving any JV Entity shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, no JV Entity shall be bound thereby
or have any liability thereunder.

 

(f) _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) applicable to the transfer of the Transferred JV Assets shall be
paid fifty percent (50%) by the Company and fifty percent (50%) by Seller,
when due. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) otherwise incurred
in connection with this Agreement shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Purchaser and fifty percent (50%) by Seller. Seller shall pay Purchaser its
share of such Taxes no later than 10 days prior to the due date for such
Taxes. Purchaser shall pay all such Taxes when due. Purchaser shall, at its
own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by Applicable Law, Seller shall
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other

 



41  documentation. Each party shall use reasonable best efforts to avail itself
of any available exemptions from any such Taxes or fees, and to cooperate with
the other parties in providing any information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain such exemptions.

(g) _Amended Tax Returns_. Except as required by Tax law or a determination
of a Governmental Entity that is final, the Company shall not (and shall cause
each JV Entity to not) (i) amend any Tax Return filed with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (excluding any Straddle Period) or (ii) make any
retroactive election, with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, a Straddle Period), in respect of Taxes, in each
case, without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

SECTION 6.09. _Publicity_. No public release or announcement concerning
the Transactions shall be issued by any party without the prior consent of
the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be
required by law or the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance;  _provided_ , _however_
, that each of Seller and Purchaser may make internal announcements to their
respective employees that are consistent with the parties prior public
disclosures regarding the Transactions after reasonable prior notice to and
consultation with the other.

SECTION 6.10. _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested
by any party, each party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to
be taken, all such further or other actions (subject to Section 6.04), as such
other party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the
Transactions, including, in the case of Seller, executing and delivering to
Purchaser such assignments, deeds, bills of sale, consents and other
instruments as Purchaser or its counsel may reasonably request as necessary
or desirable for such purpose.

SECTION 6.11. _Records_. Following the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to the Company all agreements, documents, books, records and
files (collectively, " _Records_ "), if any, in the possession of Seller or
any AGA Subsidiary relating to the business and operations of the JV Entities
or the Mine to the extent not then in the possession of the JV Entities,
subject to the following exceptions:

(i) Purchaser recognizes that certain Records may contain incidental
information relating to the JV Entities or may relate primarily to
subsidiaries, divisions or businesses of Seller other than the JV Entities,
and that Seller may retain such Records; 

 



42 (ii) Seller may retain all Records prepared in connection with the sale of
the Company Shares, including bids received from other parties and analyses
relating to the JV Entities; and

(iii) Seller may retain any Tax Returns, and Purchaser shall be provided with
copies of such Tax Returns if they relate to the JV Entities separate Tax
Returns or separate Tax liability.

 

SECTION 6.12. _Insurance_. (a) Purchaser acknowledges that no insurance
policies other than the JV Insurance Policies are part of the assets of any
JV Entity. Subject to Section 6.12(b), Purchaser also acknowledges that none
of the JV Entities shall have any rights under the AGA Insurance Policies from
and after the Closing Date.

 

(b) In the event that the business or operations of any JV Entity or the Mine
or any JV Asset suffers or has suffered any damage, destruction or other
casualty loss, or otherwise suffers any Liability, that is insured under the
AGA Insurance Policies and arises or has arisen after the date hereof and
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause AGA or the appropriate
AGA Subsidiary to, surrender to the Company after the Closing Date any
insurance proceeds received by Seller, AGA or any AGA Subsidiary under any AGA
Insurance Policy with respect to such damage, destruction or casualty loss,
less (i) any amount of such insurance proceeds applied by Seller, AGA or any
AGA Subsidiary to the physical restoration of such asset, (ii) the amount of
all applicable deductibles and co-payment provisions and all payment,
reinsurance, self-insurance, "captive" insurance or reimbursement obligations
of Seller, AGA or any AGA Subsidiary in respect thereof and (iii) the amount
of Sellers, AGAs and each AGA Subsidiarys reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the foregoing. Seller, AGA
and the AGA Subsidiaries may, at any time, without liability or obligation to
the JV Entities, amend, commute, terminate, buy out, extinguish liability
under or otherwise modify any AGA Insurance Policy. None of Seller, AGA or
any AGA Subsidiary shall bear any Liability for the failure (i) to give prompt
notice of any insurable event under any AGA Insurance Policy or (ii) of an
insurer to pay any claim under any AGA Insurance Policy.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _AGA Insurance Policy_ " means any
insurance policy with a third party insurer under which a JV Entity is a
beneficiary, other than the JV Insurance Policies.

SECTION 6.13. _Substitution of AGA Guarantees_. From and after the date
hereof, Purchaser and Seller shall each use their reasonable best efforts to
arrange for and substitute, on or prior to the Closing, each AGA Guaranty with
a letter of credit, indemnity agreement, surety bond or other similar
agreement made or delivered by Purchaser or a sufficiently creditworthy
affiliate thereof on substantially the same terms as such AGA Guaranty or in
such other form or amount as is reasonably acceptable to the Governmental
Entity or other person that holds or is benefited by such AGA Guaranty. If
Purchaser and Seller are unable or are not permitted under Applicable Law to
effectuate such substitution on or prior to Closing, Purchaser and Seller
shall continue to use their 

 



43  reasonable best efforts to effectuate such substitution as soon as
practicable following the Closing. If after a period of one year from the date

Entities).

(i) under clause (i) or (iii) of Section 9.02(a), unless the aggregate of all
Losses for which Seller, AGA-USA and AGA would, but for this clause (i) or
Section 9.02(b)(ii), be liable under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section
9.02(a) exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $10,000,000 (the "
_General Deductible Amount_ "), following which Seller, AGA-USA and AGA shall
only be liable for any such Losses exceeding the General Deductible Amount;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (i) shall not apply to any claim for
indemnification with respect to the representations and warranties in Section
3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, 4.01, 4.02 or 4.11 (each such representation and

49  under such clause (ii) exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to
$5,000,000 (the " _Environmental Deductible Amount_ "), following which
Seller, AGA-USA and AGA shall only be liable for any such Losses exceeding
the Environmental Deductible Amount;

(iii) under clause (i) or (ii) of Section 9.02(a), in excess of $80,000,000;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (iii) shall not apply to any claim

(c) In determining whether any representation or warranty of Seller, AGA-USA
or AGA in this Agreement is inaccurate, and the amount of Losses resulting
from such inaccuracy, all qualifications of materiality, Seller Material
Adverse Effect and Company Material Adverse Effect in such representation and
warranty shall be disregarded. This Section 9.02(c) shall not apply to any
breach of Section 3.03, 4.03(a), 4.05(a), 4.06(a), 4.07(a), 4.09(a), 4.13(a),
4.14(a) or 4.16(g).

(d) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Purchaser
acknowledges that, in the absence of fraud, its sole and exclusive monetary
remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement if the
Closing occurs, the Acquisition and the other Transactions, any JV Entity and
its assets and liabilities shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of
Purchaser and the Company hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have as of the Closing
against Seller, AGA-USA or AGA arising under or based upon this Agreement, any
other Transaction Documents, any document or certificate delivered in
connection herewith, any Applicable Law (including any relating to
environmental matters) or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article IX and for rights, claims and causes of
action arising out of fraud of Seller, AGA-USA or AGA). This Section 9.02(d)
does not apply to claims after the Closing for any breach after the Closing of

claim that is to be determined by the Accounting Firm under Section 2.04.

SECTION 9.03. _Other Indemnification by Purchaser_. (a) From and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify each Seller Indemnitee against and hold it

 



50  harmless from any Loss suffered or incurred by such Seller Indemnitee (other
than any Loss relating to Taxes, for which the exclusive indemnification
provisions are set forth in Section 9.01) to the extent arising from:

(i) any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement not being true and correct when made or at the Closing;

(ii) any breach of any covenant of Purchaser contained in this Agreement,
other than Section 6.01(c) or 6.04;

(iii) any JV Liabilities;

 

(iv) obligations arising following the Closing under any AGA Guaranty other
than as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken by AGA or any AGA
Subsidiary; and

(v) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Purchaser to
any brokers, financial advisors or comparable other persons retained or
employed by it in connection with the Transactions.

(b) In determining whether any representation or warranty of Purchaser in
this Agreement is inaccurate, and the amount of Losses resulting from such
inaccuracy, all qualifications of materiality and Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect in such representation and warranty shall be disregarded.

(c) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Seller, AGA-
USA and AGA each acknowledges that, in the absence of fraud, its sole and
exclusive monetary remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to this
Agreement if the Closing occurs, the Acquisition and the other Transactions,
any JV Entity and its assets and liabilities shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of Seller, AGA-USA and AGA hereby waives, from and after the
Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have as of
the Closing against Purchaser arising under or based upon this Agreement, any
other Transaction Documents, any document or certificate delivered in
connection herewith, any Applicable Law (including any relating
to environmental matters) or otherwise (except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX and for rights, claims
and causes of action arising out of fraud of Purchaser). This Section 9.03(c)
does not apply to claims after the Closing for any breach after the Closing
of the Transition Services Agreement or the Net Smelter Returns Royalty or to
any claim that is to be determined by the Accounting Firm under Section 2.04.

 

SECTION 9.04. _Calculation of Losses_. (a) The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall be net of any amounts
recovered by the indemnified party under insurance policies with respect to
such Loss. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless a
final determination (which shall include the execution of a Form 870-AD or
successor form) with respect to the indemnified party or any of its affiliates
causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for Federal income Tax purposes.

 



51 (b) The amount of the Loss to Purchaser or the Company arising out of any item
included as a liability in calculating the Adjustment Amount shall be
calculated net of the amount so included.

(c) Under no circumstances shall any party be liable to indemnify any person
under Section 9.02(a)(i), 9.02(a)(ii), 9.02(a)(iii), 9.02(a)(iv), 9.02(a)(v),
9.03(a)(i), 9.03(a)(ii) or 9.10 for any punitive damages or remote damages
unless paid or payable to a third party unaffiliated with any party hereto.
For the avoidance of doubt, Losses for which Purchaser Indemnitees are
entitled to indemnification under Section 9.02(a) and 9.10 or Seller
Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification under Section 9.03(a) may include
consequential damages.

SECTION 9.05. _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless any party (i) pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i),
9.02(a)(ii) or 9.03(a)(i) shall terminate when the applicable representation
or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 9.07, and no claim may be brought
with respect to any representation and warranty following such termination,
(ii) pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(iii) or 9.02(a)(iv) shall terminate on
December 31, 2016, and no claim may be brought with respect to any such
covenant following such termination, and (iii) pursuant to Section 9.01 or
the other clauses of Sections 9.02 and 9.03 shall not terminate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not
terminate with respect to any item as to which the person to be indemnified
shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a
claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the
basis of such claim) pursuant to Section 9.06 to the party to be providing
the indemnification.

SECTION 9.06. _Procedures_. (a) _Third Party Claims_. In order for a person
(the " _indemnified party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided
for under Section 9.02 or 9.03 in respect of, arising out of or involving a
claim made by any person against the indemnified party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), such indemnified party must notify the indemnifying party in
writing (and in reasonable detail) of the Third Party Claim promptly after
receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to
the indemnifying party, promptly following the indemnified partys receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) _Assumption._ If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party
and the indemnifying party affirms in writing that the indemnifying party is
required to indemnify the indemnified party under Section 9.02 or 9.03 in
respect of such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected

 



52  by the indemnifying party; _provided_ , _however_ , that such counsel is not
reasonably objected to by the indemnified party; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim if (i) the indemnified party shall have one or more legal or
equitable defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to
those available to the indemnifying party, and, in the reasonable opinion of
the indemnified party, counsel for the indemnifying party could not adequately
represent the interests of the indemnified party because such interests could
be in conflict with those of the indemnifying party, (ii) such Third-Party
Claim is reasonably likely to have a material and adverse effect on any other
matter beyond the scope or limits of the indemnification obligation of the
indemnifying party, (iii) such Third-Party Claim involves injunctive or other
non-monetary relief (provided that if such Third-Party Claim includes a
request for injunctive or other non-monetary relief, the indemnifying party
may assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim so long as the indemnified
party has joint control of the defense of the portion of such Third-Party
Claim relating to the request for injunctive or other non-monetary relief) or
(iv) the indemnifying party shall not have assumed the defense of such Third-
Party Claim in a timely fashion (but in any event within 30 days of written
notice of such Third-Party Claim). Should the indemnifying party so elect to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not
be liable to the indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. If
the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel (not
reasonably objected to by the indemnifying party), at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being
understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying
party has not assumed the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party chooses
to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall keep
the indemnified party reasonably apprised of the status of the Third-Party
Claim and shall furnish the indemnified party with copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the indemnifying party
relating to the Third Party Claim, and all the indemnified parties shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the indemnifying partys request) the
provision to the indemnifying party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified
party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise
or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the indemnifying party shall not admit any liability with respect to,
or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
indemnified partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge
of a Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party may

 



53  recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the
full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, which
releases the indemnified party completely and unconditionally from all
liability in connection with such Third Party Claim and that would not
otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party.

 

(c) _Other Claims._ In the event any indemnified party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under Section 9.02 or 9.03 that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such indemnified party, the indemnified party may make such claim
directly against any indemnifying party by delivering notice of such claim to
the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party does not notify the
indemnified party within 10 business days following its receipt of such notice
that the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party
under Section 9.02 or 9.03, such claim specified by the indemnified party in
such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the indemnifying party
under Section 9.02 or 9.03 and the indemnifying party shall pay the amount of
such liability to the indemnified party on demand or, in the case of any
notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated,
on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion thereof)
becomes finally determined.

 

(d) _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims_.

 

(i) In the event that Seller would be liable for the payment of any Taxes
under Section 9.01, Seller, in its reasonable discretion, will have the right
to control the portion of any audit involving any such Taxes and/or to contest
any assertion that any such Taxes are payable in any proceedings available to
any JV Entity, Seller or Purchaser (a " _Tax Proceeding_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , Seller shall (A) keep Purchaser reasonably informed and consult in

(c) _Designated Matters Sharing_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding Section 9.10(a), the parties have agreed that Seller
(including AGA and the AGA Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company
(including the other JV Entities and Purchaser), on the other hand, shall
share equally the first $7,500,000 of the Net Designated Matters Amount,
whether negative or positive.

applicable, shall promptly pay to the other an amount in cash necessary to
implement the sharing contemplated by Section 9.10(c)(i). 

(d) _Procedures_.

 

(i) In order for a Purchaser Indemnitee to be entitled to any indemnification
for any claim with respect to Designated Matters Losses (each a " _Designated
Matters Claim_ "), Purchaser must notify Seller in writing (and in reasonable
detail) of the Designated Matters Claim promptly after receipt by such
Purchaser Indemnitee of written notice of the Designated Matters Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Seller
Indemnitors shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of
such failure. Thereafter, Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller Indemnitors,
promptly following the Purchaser Indemnitees receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Purchaser
Indemnitee relating to the Designated Matters Claim.

(ii) If a Designated Matters Claim is made against a Purchaser Indemnitee
and the Purchaser Indemnitee affirms in writing that the Seller Indemnitors
are required to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitee under this Section 9.10 in
respect of such Designated Matters Claim, the Seller Indemnitors shall be
entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, after consultation with
the other Parties to determine the most appropriate Party to defend such
Designated Matters Claim, taking into consideration the reasonable business
concerns of the Parties, upon the request of Purchaser shall assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Seller (not reasonably objected
to by Purchaser). Should the Seller Indemnitors assume the defense of a
Designated Matters Claim, the Seller Indemnitors shall not be liable to the
Purchaser Indemnitees for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Purchaser Indemnitees in connection with the defense thereof. If the Seller
Indemnitors assumes such defense, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel (not
reasonably objected to by the Seller), at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Seller Indemnitors, it being understood that the
Seller Indemnitors shall control such defense, and the costs of any such
counsel shall not be included in Designated Matters Losses. If the Seller
Indemnitors choose to, or are requested by Purchaser to, defend or prosecute a
Designated Matters Claim, the Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably apprised
of the status of the Designated Matters Claim and shall furnish Purchaser with
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Seller Indemnitors relating to the Designated Matters Claim, and
all Purchaser Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof.

 



57 (e) _Joint Defense Agreement_. AGA and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith
to determine whether it is in their mutual best interests to enter into joint
defense agreements with respect to any of the Designated Matters.

(f)  _No Settlement_.

(i) None of the Purchaser Indemnitees shall admit any liability with respect
to, or settle, compromise or discharge (i) any Designated Matters Claim or
any other claim arising out of a Designated Matters Contract without the
Sellers prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed) or (ii) any other claim involving a party
to a Designated Matters Claim that might adversely prejudice a Designated
Matters Claim in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser (whether or not in
connection with a Designated Matters Claim) without the Sellers prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

(ii) Prior to the Closing Date, none of the Seller Indemnitors or the JV
Entities shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge any Designated Matters Claim without Purchasers prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(g) _Access to Books, Records, Properties and Personnel of
Purchaser Indemnitees_. Each of the Purchaser Indemnitees shall (i) provide
the Seller Indemnitors with reasonable access to its books, records and
properties in connection with any Designated Matter, (ii) retain and (upon the
Seller Indemnitors request) provide to the Seller Indemnitors the books and
records that are reasonably relevant to such Designated Matter, and (iii) make
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(h) _Cooperation_.

 

(i) The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts and act in good faith
to fully cooperate and coordinate in the prosecution and defense of, and to
reach effective resolutions of, all Designated Matters and, to the extent the
parties mutually agree that a steering committee is necessary or desirable to
facilitate the foregoing in the case of any Designated Matter, shall jointly
appoint a steering committee for purposes of advising Seller and Purchaser on
such Designated Matter. The Purchaser Indemnitees shall provide commercially
reasonable assistance in the prosecution and defense of all
Designated Matters and any counterclaims in respect thereof. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the JV Entities shall, if requested in good
faith by Seller, assert Designated Matters against third parties, including by
formal proceedings if so requested using counsel selected by Seller (not
reasonably objected to by Purchaser);

 



58   _provided_ that the JV Entities shall not be required to so assert any
Designated Matter if Purchaser determines in its reasonable discretion after
due consideration that making such assertions would be adverse to its
business interests.

(ii) The Seller Indemnitors shall provide, at the Seller Indemnitors cost
(which shall not require any payments to any Purchaser Indemnitee or any third
party), all reasonable assistance to the Purchaser Indemnitees in the
Purchaser Indemnitees defense of any Proceeding with respect to causes of
action arising out of the construction of heap leach facilities on the Company
Properties, to the extent arising out of actions and occurrences prior to June

Entities to the JV Entities immediately

to provide the Services only to the JV Entities or, at the request of a JV

services as, or services that involve the same resources as those used to

may modify the Services in connection with changes to its internal
organization in the ordinary course of business so long as such modification
is generally applicable to all affiliates of Seller for whom Seller provides
services comparable to the Services.

(d) The Company further acknowledges that, in connection with providing the
Services, no Seller Entity will be required to use its own funds for any third
party provided service or payment obligation of the JV Entities, their
respective affiliates or the Business. In addition, no Seller Entity shall be
obligated to pay any amounts to the JV Entities, the Business or any of their
respective employees in respect of payroll, benefits or similar obligations,
unless such Seller Entity has received such amounts in advance from such JV
Entity.

SECTION 2.02. _Warranty Disclaimer_. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 2.01,
SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING
THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY
APPLICABLE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES.

SECTION 2.03. _Access; Books and Records_. The Company shall make available,
and shall cause each other JV Entity to make available, on a timely basis to
the applicable Seller Entity all information and materials reasonably
requested by such Seller Entity to enable it to provide the Services
hereunder. The Company shall give, and shall cause each other JV Entity to
give, each Seller Entity and its representatives reasonable access during
regular business hours and at such other times as are reasonably required, to
the Companys and such JV Entitys premises or the premises of the Business
for the purpose of providing the Services hereunder.

 



3 SECTION 2.04. _Documentation_. For so long as Services are provided hereunder
and for one year thereafter, Seller shall keep reasonable supporting

During such period, Seller shall make such documentation available to the
Company, and such other documentation as may be reasonably requested and
available, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours.

the Company identifies additional services that the JV Entities require in
order to conduct the Business or effectuate the Integration, the Company may
request that Seller provide, or cause other Seller Entities to provide, such
additional services hereunder. Seller shall consider any such request in good
faith and, so long as such services may be provided to the JV Entities without
violation of Applicable Law or the policies and procedures of the Seller
Entities in place on the date of the Purchase Agreement, Seller shall
negotiate in good faith with the Company regarding the scope and description
of the additional services to be provided, the costs to be charged by Seller
to the Company for providing such additional services, the duration of the
provision of such services and any other applicable terms. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Services" shall include any such additional services
agreed upon in writing by Seller and the Company in accordance with this
Section 2.05.

SECTION 2.06. _Company Intellectual Property Rights; Ownership of Derivative
Works and Data; Provision of Software Related Services_. (a) Seller
acknowledges that the JV Entities are the sole and exclusive owner of the
Company Intellectual Property Rights. Seller shall not, during the Term
or thereafter, make any use of any Company Intellectual Property Rights for
any reason other than to provide the Services hereunder.

(b) Seller, for itself and each of the other Seller Entities, acknowledges
and agrees that to the extent any Seller Entity (i) creates any derivative
works of the Company Intellectual Property Rights in connection with the
provision of Services hereunder, ownership of the new original elements of
any such derivative work shall reside with the JV Entities and is hereby
assigned by the Seller Entities to the JV Entities; or (ii) obtains, collects,
creates, generates, or processes any Company Intellectual Property Rights in
connection with the provision of Services hereunder, ownership of such Company
Intellectual Property Rights shall reside with the JV Entities and is hereby
assigned by the Seller Entities to the JV Entities. 

(c) To the extent that, in connection with providing Services hereunder,
Seller or any other Seller Entity completes any modifications, bug fixes,
updates, upgrades or other changes to software that constitutes Company
Intellectual Property Rights, Seller shall not, and shall cause the other
Seller Entities not to, incorporate or use any (i) third party owned
components in such software or (ii) "open source" or similar software code
such that the JV Entities would be obligated to license or provide their own
source code to any person in such software, in each case, without the prior
written consent of the Company.

 



4 SECTION 2.07. _Confidentiality_. Seller shall, and shall cause the other
Seller Entities and its and their officers, directors, managers and
employees, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
representatives, agents and contractors to, keep confidential, and not use for
its benefit or the benefit of any other person or to the detriment of the JV
Entities or their affiliates, any and all confidential or proprietary
information in the possession of the Seller Entities that directly relates to
the JV Entities, any of their affiliates or their respective businesses
or operations; provided that Seller may disclose such information to its
directors and officers, and to its employees, affiliates, agents, attorneys,
accountants and financial advisors who need to know such information for the
operation of the Seller and its affiliates and their respective businesses.
The Seller will inform such recipients of the confidential nature of such
information, and each such person shall agree to treat such information as
confidential in accordance with this Agreement. The provisions of this
Section 2.07 shall not apply to the disclosure by the Seller Entities of any
information, documents or materials (i) that are, or become, publicly
available, other than by reason of a breach of this Section 2.07, (ii)
received from a third party not bound by any confidentiality agreement with
the JV Entities, (iii) required to be disclosed by Applicable Law or the
applicable rules of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the New York Stock
Exchange, the Ghana Stock Exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange or any
other recognized securities exchange (collectively, the " _Exchange Rules_ "),
(iv) independently developed by the Seller or any of its affiliates or (v)
are part of the general business information held by the Seller Entities prior
to Closing and that is related to affiliates other than the JV Entities;
provided that in the case of clause (iii) Seller will promptly notify
the Company prior to any disclosure of such confidential or proprietary
information and, to the extent practicable, provide the Company a reasonable
opportunity to prevent public disclosure of such information. The proviso in
the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to the disclosure of
information required by Applicable Law or any Exchange Rule to be disclosed in
AGAs periodic or current reports filed pursuant to Applicable Law or any
Exchange Rule. In the event a protective order or other remedy to prevent
public disclosure is not obtained, Seller may disclose only that portion of
the confidential information that is required by Applicable Law or any
Exchange Rule to be disclosed. Upon demand by the Company at any time, Seller
agrees promptly to return or destroy, at the Companys option, all
confidential or proprietary information, other than any such confidential or
proprietary information that is required to be included or is reasonably
likely to be required to be included in any of AGAs periodic or current
reports filed pursuant to Applicable Law or any Exchange Rule. If such
confidential or proprietary information is destroyed, an authorized officer of
Seller shall certify to such destruction in writing.

SECTION 2.08. _Systems Security_. If a party shall receive access to any of
the other partys computer facilities, system(s), voice or data networks or
software (" _Systems_ ") in connection with performance or receipt of the
Services, such receiving party shall, and shall cause its affiliates and its
and their officers, directors, managers, employees, representatives, agents
and contractors to, comply with all reasonable system security policies,
procedures and requirements that may be provided by the providing party to
receiving party in writing from time to time (the " _Security Regulations_ ")
and shall not tamper with, compromise or circumvent any security or audit
measures

 



5  employed by the providing party. Any employees of the receiving party or any
of its affiliates that are expected to be given access to the providing
partys Systems may be required to execute a separate system access
agreement. The receiving party shall ensure that only such users who are
specifically authorized to gain access to the providing partys Systems will
gain such access and shall prevent unauthorized destruction, alteration or
loss of information contained therein. If at any time the providing party
determines that any personnel of the receiving party or any of its affiliates
has sought to circumvent or has circumvented the providing partys
Security Regulations or that an unauthorized person has accessed or may
access the providing partys Systems or a person has engaged in activities
that may lead to the unauthorized access, destruction or alteration or loss of
data, information or software, the providing party shall immediately
terminate any such persons access to the Systems and immediately notify the
receiving party.

 

SECTION 2.09. _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto shall from time to time
execute, or procure the execution of, such documents and instruments as the
other party may reasonably require and take such other action as the other
party may reasonably request to more fully and effectively effectuate the
purposes of this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _Payment; Billing; Taxes_

 

SECTION 4.01. _Fees_. For the Services rendered under this Agreement, the
Company shall pay to Seller (a) an amount equal to 110% of the fully-burdened
costs associated with the performance of the Services set forth in Schedule I,
which costs shall be calculated in a manner consistent with the current
practice of the Company in allocating costs to its business units as
agreed among the parties prior to the date hereof (i.e., fully-burdened labor
costs, which include employee benefit expenses and an allocation of overhead,
_plus_ direct expenses) (the " _Fees_ ") and (b) any reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by Seller or any of its affiliates in connection
with the provision of the Services hereunder, without duplication or expansion
of the expenses otherwise included in the Fees (the " _Additional Out-of-
Pocket Expenses_ "). Seller shall notify the Company in advance of any
Additional Out-of-Pocket Expenses reasonably expected to exceed $50,000.

 

SECTION 4.02. _Billing_. (a) No later than the 15th day of each month, Seller
shall deliver to the Company an invoice in a form agreed between the Company
and Seller (each, an " _Invoice_ ") setting forth all amounts payable by the
Company in connection with the Services provided during the immediately
preceding month. Any amounts set forth on an Invoice as owed by the Company
to Seller shall be paid within 15 days after the Companys receipt of such
Invoice (the date such a payment is due, as may be adjusted pursuant to
Section 4.02(b), a " _Payment Date_ ").

 

(b) If the Company disagrees with any amounts set forth on an Invoice, the
Company shall send Seller written notice of such disagreement (an "
_Objection_ ") within 30 days after the Companys receipt of such Invoice.
Notwithstanding the delivery of an Objection, the applicable JV Entity shall
pay the applicable Seller Entity, or the applicable Seller Entity shall
pay the applicable JV Entity, within 15 days after the

 



7  Companys receipt of such Invoice, that portion of the amount set forth on
the Invoice as to which the Company does not disagree. The Company and Seller
shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute set forth in an Objection
within 30 days after receipt of such Objection by Seller from the Company. If
the Company and Seller are unable to resolve all such disputes within such
30-day period, the matters remaining in dispute shall be submitted to KPMG
LLP (the " _Independent Expert_ "). The parties shall instruct the Independent
Expert to render its written decision as promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than 60 days after submission of the matters remaining in
dispute. The dispute resolution by the Independent Expert under this Section
4.02(b) shall constitute an "expert determination" subject to NY CPLR Article
76. The resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall be final
and binding. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne
equally by the Company and Seller. Within 10 days after the Independent Expert
renders its decision, any amounts the Independent Expert determines are owed
shall be paid by the applicable party to the other.

SECTION 4.03. _Payment_. (a) All payments required to be made hereunder by
the Company shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
one or more accounts designated in writing by Seller. Any payments not made
within five days of a Payment Date shall be subject to late charges for each
day such payments are overdue, calculated at the Interest Rate per annum,
calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365,
from the Payment Date to the date of payment.

 

(b) Any payment to be made by the Company under this Agreement shall be made
in full, without any set-off, restriction or condition (whether for or on
account of any counterclaim or otherwise) and without, and free and clear of,
any deduction or withholding whatsoever unless such deduction or withholding
is then required by Applicable Law.

 

SECTION 4.04. _Taxes_. The Company shall, and shall cause each other
applicable JV Entity to, timely pay any Taxes assessed on the provision of
the Services hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the immediately
preceding sentence, unless otherwise expressly provided, the Fees as set out
in Section 4.01 do not include any amount in respect of sales Tax or
similar duty applicable from time to time to the sale or supply of such
Services, and if any such sales Tax or similar duty is applicable to a sale or
supply of such Services, an amount equal to such sales Tax or similar duty
shall be added to any such Fee in question (or any increase to such Fee) and
the applicable JV Entity shall pay to Seller, in addition to such Fee (and any
increase to such Fee) and in the manner described in Section 4.03, the amount
equal to such sales Tax or similar duty.

defect or re-perform such

 



8  Service, or cause the other Seller Entities to so correct or re-perform, in
a timely manner at the expense of Seller. To be effective, any such request by
the Company must (i) specify in reasonable detail the particular error or
defect and (ii) be made no more than 30 days from the date such Service was

SECTION 5.02. _Limitation on Liability_. (a) If Seller refuses or is unable

Seller Entities with respect to this Agreement or any act or failure to act in
connection herewith (including the performance or breach hereof), or from the
sale, delivery, provision, use of, or the failure to sell, deliver,
provide or use, any Services, whether in contract, in tort (including
negligence and strict liability) or otherwise, shall be limited to the
Companys actual, direct damages (as further limited by Section 5.02(b)).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
including with respect to any Losses of the Company described in Section
5.03(b), the liability of Seller and its affiliates that in any way arises out
of, relates to or is a consequence of this Agreement or anything done in
connection herewith, including the performance or breach hereof or the
sale, delivery, provision or use of, or the failure to sell, deliver, provide
or use, any of the Services hereunder, whether in contract, in tort (including

expenses, including reasonable third-party legal fees and expenses
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), to the extent arising or resulting from any
Seller Entitys performance of the Services hereunder, except to the
extent such Losses are due to any Seller Entitys gross negligence or willful
misconduct in performing the Services hereunder.

(b) Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company from and
against any and all Losses that arise or result from any Seller Entitys gross
negligence or willful misconduct in performing the Services hereunder.

SECTION 6.01. _Force Majeure_. (a) Subject to Section 6.01(c), if any party is
unable, in whole or in part, by reason of Force Majeure, to carry out any
obligations under this Agreement, the obligation shall be suspended so far as
or for as long as it is affected by such Force Majeure.

 



9 (b) The party affected by the Force Majeure event must: (i) give prompt notice
to the other party of the event of Force Majeure, including the nature and
details of such event, and to the extent the party giving such notice is
aware, the probable extent to which it will be unable to perform or be delayed
in performing such obligation and (ii) use all possible diligence to remove
such event of Force Majeure or the effect of it as quickly as possible.

(c) Any obligation to pay money for Services rendered shall not be suspended
or excused by an event of Force Majeure.

(d) The requirement that any event of Force Majeure or its effect be removed
with all possible diligence does not require the settlement of strikes,
lockouts or other labor disputes on terms, or the meeting of any claims or
demands of any Governmental Entity, in a manner contrary to the wishes of the
party affected.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Force Majeure_ " shall mean an act of

the kind specifically set out in this definition or otherwise which is not
reasonably within the control of the party.

NET SMELTER RETURNS

 

ROYALTY AGREEMENT

This Royalty Agreement (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to
time, this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into effective as of
, 2015 (the " _Effective Date_ "), by and between AngloGold Ashanti
(Colorado) Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Grantor_ "), and AngloGold
Ashanti North America Inc., a Colorado corporation (" _Grantee_ "). Grantor
and Grantee sometimes are referred to in this Agreement together as the "
_Parties_ " and each individually as a " _Party_."

 

In consideration of Ten Dollars (US$10.00) and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Parties hereby agree as follows.

1\. _Royalty_.

 

1.1. _Grant of Royalty_. Grantor shall pay to Grantee a perpetual production
royalty (the " _Royalty_ ") equal to two and one-half percent (2.50%) (the "
_Royalty Percentage_ ") of Net Smelter Returns from the sale or other
disposition of all Royalty Gold from the properties described on attached
_Schedule A_ (the " _Properties_ "), determined in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. " _Royalty Gold_ " shall mean (i) all gold mined
via underground mining methods from the Properties, regardless of ore gold
grade, and (ii) all gold that is mined via open pit mining methods from the
Properties situated below the Projected Final Pit Shells and is contained in
ore with an in-situ gold grade of at least 0.1166 troy ounces per ton of ore,
as determined in accordance with sound mining and metallurgical accounting
practices consistent with those required in Section 1.6 for commingling.

1.2. _Net Smelter Returns_. 

(a) " _Net Smelter Returns_ " shall be determined for purposes of the Royalty
payable in any calendar quarter by multiplying (i) the gross number of troy
ounces of Royalty Gold recovered from production from the Properties in dore
or concentrates of the Royalty Gold produced by Grantors High Grade Mill,
Valley Leach Facilities or any other final processing plants (such dore or
concentrates of the Royalty Gold, the " _Beneficiated Royalty Gold_ ") that is
delivered to the smelter, refiner, processor, purchaser or other recipient of
such production (collectively, the " _Payor_ ") during the preceding calendar
quarter, by (ii) the average of the London Bullion Market Association, PM Fix,
daily spot gold prices, expressed in United States Dollars, reported for such
preceding calendar quarter (the " _Applicable Spot Gold Price_ "), and
subtracting from the product of Subsections 1.2(a)(i) and (ii) the following:
(A) charges imposed by the Payor for refining Beneficiated Royalty Gold;
_provided_ , _however_ , that charges imposed by the Payor for smelting or
refining of raw or crushed ore containing Royalty Gold or similarly processed
Royalty Gold shall not be subtracted in determining Net Smelter Returns; (B)
penalty substance, assaying, usual and customary Metal Retention Deductions,
and sampling charges imposed by the Payor for refining Beneficiated Royalty
Gold contained in such production; and (C) charges and costs, if any, for
transportation and insurance of Beneficiated Royalty Gold from Grantors
final mill or other final processing plant to places where such Beneficiated
Royalty Gold is smelted, refined and/or sold or otherwise disposed of. If the
London Bullion Market Association discontinues the Applicable Spot Gold Price
or if some other price reference replaces the Applicable Spot Gold Price as
the gold industry standard gold price, the Grantee and the Grantor shall apply
such new gold industry standard or, acting reasonably, agree to a new
price reference. The Grantee and the Grantor shall, acting reasonably,
mutually determine whether any other price reference has replaced the
Applicable Spot Gold Price as the gold industry standard gold price. (b) If the refining of bullion from the Beneficiated Royalty Gold is carried
out in custom toll facilities owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by
Grantor, which facilities were not constructed solely for the purpose of
refining Beneficiated Royalty Gold produced from the Properties, then charges,
costs and penalties for such refining shall mean the amount Grantor would
have incurred if such refining were carried out at facilities not owned or
controlled by Grantor then offering comparable services for comparable
products on prevailing terms, but in no event greater than actual charges,
costs and penalties incurred by Grantor with respect to such refining. In the
event Grantor receives insurance proceeds for loss of production and/or sales
of Royalty Gold, Grantor shall pay to Grantee the Royalty Percentage of any
such insurance proceeds (with such payments, to the extent they relate to
Beneficiated Royalty Gold that is subsequently produced, to be offset against
the Royalty that subsequently would become payable on such Royalty Gold
pursuant to this Agreement). 

1.3. _Payments of Royalty In Cash or In Kind_. Royalty payments shall be made
to Grantee as follows:

 

(a) _Royalty Payable In Kind_. Grantee may elect to receive its Royalty on
Royalty Gold from the Properties "in cash _"_ or "in kind" as refined bullion
from Beneficiated Royalty Gold (" _Refined Bullion_ "). Grantee may make such
election only once per year, on a calendar year basis. Grantee shall give
written Notice of election to receive the Royalty payable in any calendar
year in cash or in kind to Grantor on or before November 1 of the immediately
preceding calendar year. If Grantee fails timely to make such election for any
calendar year, the Royalty payable in such calendar year shall be payable in
the same manner as it was payable in the immediately preceding calendar year.
As of the Effective Date, Grantee elects to receive the Royalty in cash.

 

(i) If Grantee elects to receive the Royalty for any period in kind, Grantee
shall open a bullion storage account at each refinery or mint designated by
Grantor as a possible recipient of Refined Bullion in which Grantee owns an
interest. Grantee shall be solely responsible for all costs and liabilities
associated with maintenance of such account or accounts, and Grantor shall not
be required to bear any additional expense with respect to such in-kind
payments.

(ii) The Royalty payable in kind shall be paid by the deposit of Refined
Bullion into Grantees account. On or before the twenty-fifth (25th) day
following the end of a calendar quarter during which sale or other disposition
of Beneficiated Royalty Gold occurs (the " _In-Kind Quarterly Payment Date_
"), Grantor shall deliver written instructions to the Payor, with a copy to
Grantee, directing the Payor to deliver Refined Bullion due to Grantee in
respect of the Royalty, by crediting to Grantees account the number of troy
ounces equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Refined Bullion due to
Grantee in respect of the Royalty (the " _In-Kind Quarterly Payment_ "),
subject to Section 1.4;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the words "other
disposition" as used in this sentence shall not include processing, milling,
beneficiation or refining losses of Royalty Gold.

 

(iii) Title to Refined Bullion delivered to Grantee under this Agreement shall
pass to Grantee at the time such bullion is credited to Grantee at the mint
or refinery.

(iv) Grantee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Grantor from any losses
incurred as a result of Grantees trading and hedging activities. Grantee
assumes all responsibility for any shortages that occur as a result of
Grantees anticipation of credits to its account in advance of an actual
deposit or credit to its account by a refiner or mint. (v) Grantee acknowledges that when the Royalty is paid in kind, it will not
reflect the costs deductible in calculating Net Smelter Returns from
Beneficiated Royalty Gold under clause 1.2 (a) of this Agreement. Within
thirty (30) days of the receipt of a statement showing charges incurred by
Grantor for transportation, smelting or other deductible costs, Grantee shall
remit to Grantor full payment for such charges. If Grantee does not pay such
charges when due, Grantor shall have the right, at its election, provided
Grantee does not dispute such charges, to deduct the gold equivalent of such
charges from the ounces of Refined Bullion to be credited to Grantee in the
following quarter.

(b) _Royalty Payable In Cash_. In the case of the Royalty payable with
respect to Royalty Gold from the Properties that Grantee has elected, in any
period, to receive in cash, for each calendar quarter, a payment shall be due
on or before the date (the " _Cash Quarterly Payment Date_ ") that is the
later of (i) five (5) Business Days after the date on which Grantor receives
payment from Payor for such Royalty Gold and (ii) the twenty-fifth (25th) day
following the end of a calendar quarter in which such Royalty Gold was shipped
to the Payor by Grantor, equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Royalty
payable for such calendar quarter (the " _Cash Quarterly Payment_ "), subject
to Section 1.4. Grantor shall make each payment with respect to the Royalty to
be paid in cash by delivery of a check payable to Grantee and delivering such
check to Grantee at the address listed in this Agreement, or to such other
address as Grantee may direct or by direct bank deposit to Grantees account
as Grantee shall designate. Should default be made in any cash payment when
due and such default exists ten (10) Business days following Notice of non-
payment given by Grantee to Grantor, all unpaid amounts then due shall bear
interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum commencing from and after
such payment due date until paid.

 

(c) _Detailed Statement_. All Royalty payments or credits shall be supported
by a detailed statement to be provided at the time of payment (the "
_Detailed Statement_ "). The Detailed Statement for the Royalty payment with
respect to any calendar quarter (including any In-Kind Quarterly Payment, Cash
Quarterly Payment or payment by the Grantor pursuant to Section 1.4) shall
set out all details related to the calculation of the Royalty for such
calendar quarter, including the determination of Royalty Gold, the
Beneficiated Royalty Gold, details of all charges, penalties and costs
together with any available settlement sheets from the Payor, the Applicable
Spot Gold Price, and all Data (as defined in Section 7.1 below) related to the
determination of any of these factors relevant to the calculation of the
Royalty.

 

1.4. _Final Payments and Reconciliation_.

 

(a) The Parties recognize that periods of time exists between the production
of ore, the production of dore or concentrates from ore, the production of
refined or finished product from dore or concentrates, the delivery of dore or
concentrates to the Payor, and the receipt of refined or finished product, and
acknowledge that the payment of the Royalty for any calendar quarter will not
coincide exactly with the actual amount of refined or finished product
delivered by the Payor. Grantor shall provide to Grantee a final
reconciliation of the Royalty payable with respect to all Royalty Gold
delivered to the Payor in any calendar quarter (a " _Quarterly
Reconciliation_ ") promptly after settlement is reached with the Payor for all
lots sold or otherwise disposed of in such calendar quarter and in any event
no later than the later of (i) five (5) Business Days after the date on which
Grantor receives  payment from the Payor for the Royalty Gold produced in the relevant
calendar quarter and (ii) twenty-five (25) Business Days after the end of the
relevant calendar quarter. If on the basis of such Quarterly Reconciliation
Grantee has been underpaid by the In-Kind Quarterly Payment or the Cash
Quarterly Payment made in the relevant calendar quarter, Grantor shall pay to
Grantee the difference between (A) the In-Kind Quarterly Payment or the Cash
Quarterly Payment, as applicable, and (B) the Royalty payable for such
calendar quarter, in cash (and not in kind) concurrently with its delivery to
Grantee of such Quarterly Reconciliation. Conversely, if on the basis of any
such Quarterly Reconciliation Grantee has been overpaid by the In-Kind
Quarterly Payment or the Cash Quarterly Payment for the relevant calendar
quarter, Grantee shall pay the difference to Grantor in cash, within ten (10)
Business Days following its receipt of such Quarterly Reconciliation.
Reconciliation payments shall be made in the same manner as are payments in
cash made pursuant to Subsection 1.3(b) of this Agreement.

 

1.5. _Hedging Transactions_. All profits and losses resulting from Grantors
sales of Royalty Gold, or Grantors engaging in any commodity futures
trading, option trading, or metals trading, or any combination thereof, and
any other hedging transactions including trading transactions designed to
avoid losses and obtain possible gains due to metal price
fluctuations (collectively, " _Hedging Transactions_ "), are specifically
excluded from the calculation of the Royalty. All Hedging Transactions by
Grantor and all profits or losses associated therewith, if any, shall be
solely for Grantors account. The amount of Royalty to be paid on all Royalty
Gold subject to Hedging Transactions by Grantor shall be determined in the
manner as provided in Subsection 1.2.

 

1.6. _Commingling_. Grantor shall have the right, at any stage of production
or processing, to commingle Royalty Gold from the Properties with other
minerals mined from the Properties or minerals mined from other properties.
Before any Royalty Gold from the Properties is commingled with minerals from
the Properties or other properties, such Royalty Gold shall be measured and
sampled in accordance with sound mining and metallurgical practices for
mineral composition, moisture, metal, commercial minerals, contaminants,
penalty substances and other appropriate content (by grade or otherwise) as
necessary for Royalty Gold mined from the Properties or any other properties,
applied on a consistent basis. Representative samples of the Royalty Gold and
other metals mined from the Properties or any other properties shall be
retained by Grantor and assays (including moisture (in the case of
concentrate) and penalty substances) and other appropriate analyses of these
samples shall be made before commingling to determine gross metal content of
Royalty Gold and the basis of determining the allocation of Royalty Gold from
the Properties in the event of the sale by Grantor of mixed or commingled
gold from the Properties and/or other properties. Grantor shall retain (i)
such analyses for not less than twenty-four (24) months after such analyses
are produced, (ii) such samples taken from the Properties that contain
Royalty Gold for not less than twenty-four (24) months after such samples
taken from the Properties are taken and (iii) such samples taken from the
Properties that do not contain Royalty Gold or from other properties as
commingled for as long as reasonably practicable up to twenty-four (24) months
after such samples are taken but in any case for such period of time as is
consistent with the usual practice of CCandV as of June 1, 2015.

2\. _Stockpilings and Tailings_. All tailings, residues, waste rock, spoiled
leach materials, and other materials (collectively " _Materials_ ") resulting
from Grantors operations and activities on the Properties shall be the sole
property of Grantor, but shall remain subject to the Royalty should the
Materials be processed or reprocessed, as the case may be, in the future and
result in the production and sale or other disposition of Royalty Gold.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Grantor shall have the right to dispose of
Materials from the Properties on or off of the Properties and to commingle
the same (as provided herein) with materials from other properties. In the
event Materials from the Properties are  processed or reprocessed, as the case may be, and regardless of where such
processing or reprocessing occurs, the Royalty payable thereon shall be
determined on a pro rata basis as determined by using the best engineering
and technical practices then available.

3\. _Term_. The Royalty shall be perpetual, it being the intent of the
Parties hereto that, to the extent allowed by law, the Royalty shall
constitute a vested interest in and a covenant running with the land affecting
the Properties and all successions thereof whether created privately or
through governmental action, and shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Parties and their respective legal representatives, successors and
assigns so long as Grantor or any successor or assign of Grantor holds any
rights or interests in the Properties.

 

4\. _Real Property Interest and Relinquishment of Properties_. The Royalty
shall attach to any amendments, relocations or conversions of any mining
claim, license, or lease, concession, permit, patent or other tenure
comprising the Properties, or to any renewals or extensions thereof. If
Grantor or any Affiliate or successor or assign of Grantor surrenders, allows
to lapse or otherwise relinquishes or terminates its interest in any of the
Properties, and reacquires a direct or indirect interest in the land covered
by the former Properties, then from and after the date of such reacquisition
such reacquired properties shall be included in the Properties and the
Royalty shall apply to such interest so acquired. Grantor shall give written
Notice to Grantee within ten (10) days of any acquisition or reacquisition of
the Properties. No assignment of any Property shall invalidate Grantees
rights under this Agreement against any assignee of such Property.

5\. _No Obligation to Mine_. Grantor shall have sole discretion to determine
the extent of its mining of the Properties and the time or the times for
beginning, continuing or resuming mining operations with respect thereto.
Grantor (and its respective successors and assigns) shall have no obligation
to Grantee or otherwise to mine any of the Properties.

6\. _Recording of Agreement_. Grantee may register or record this Agreement
against title to the Properties. 

7\. _Reporting, Records and Audits, Site Inspections, New Mineral Resources or
Ore Reserves, Confidentiality and Press Releases_.

 

7.1. _Information and Access to Records, Site Inspections and Audits_. Grantee
shall have the right, during normal business hours and upon reasonable Notice
to Grantor and at Grantees sole risk and expense (other than as provided in
Section 7.2), to have access, and of Grantees auditors to have access, to
CCandV to inspect and audit (subject to Section 7.2) all books, records,
technical data, information and materials (the " _Data_ ") pertaining to
Grantors calculation of any Royalty payments and the preparation of any
Detailed Statement referred to in Subsection 1.3 (c), provided that such
inspections shall not unreasonably interfere with Grantors activities with
respect to the Properties. Grantor makes no representations or warranties to
Grantee concerning any of the Data, and Grantee agrees that, if it elects to
rely on any such Data, it does so at its sole risk. Grantor must make
available to Grantee and Grantees auditors such of its personnel as are
reasonably required by Grantee or Grantees auditors for the purposes of
conducting such an inspection or audit.

7.2. _Independent Auditor._ If Grantee disagrees with the amount of any
Royalty payment, then Grantee shall send Grantor written notice of such
disagreement (an " _Objection_ ") within 30 days after the receipt of such
Royalty payment. The Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the  disagreement set forth in an Objection within 30 Business Days after receipt
of such Objection by the Grantor. If the Parties are unable to resolve the
disagreement within such 30 Business Day period, the disagreement shall be
submitted to KPMG LLP (the " _Independent Auditor_ "). The Parties shall
instruct the Independent Auditor to render its written decision as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than 60 days after submission of the
disagreement. The Parties must cooperate with, and provide information,
including all Data, to the Independent Auditor. The written decision by the
Independent Auditor shall be final and binding. Each Party will make
the appropriate payment required in adjustment in accordance with the audit
certificate within ten (10) Business Days of receiving the audit certificate.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne by Grantee,
subject to the last sentence of this Section 7.2. If any audit or inspection
establishes (including by a written decision by the Independent Auditor) that
the subject Royalty payment is underpaid by more than five percent (5%),
Grantor shall reimburse Grantee for its costs incurred in such audit
(including its share of the fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor).

7.3. _New Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves_. If Grantor establishes a
mineral resource or ore reserve with respect to any Royalty Gold within any of
the Properties, Grantor shall provide to Grantee the amount of such mineral
resource or ore reserve, as soon as practicable after Grantor makes a public
declaration with respect to the establishment thereof, together with the
assumptions used in the determination of such mineral resources and ore
reserves including grade tonnage curves, cut-off grades, extraction ratios
and dilution factors and processing recoveries.

7.4. _Confidentiality_. Except for recording this Agreement, Grantee shall
not, without the prior written consent of Grantor, disclose to any third party
data or information obtained pursuant to this Agreement that is not generally
available to the public; _provided_ , _however_ , Grantee may disclose data
or information so obtained without the consent of Grantor: (i) to its
directors and officers, and to its employees, affiliates, agents and attorneys
who need to know such information for the operation of Grantee and
its affiliates and their respective businesses; (ii) independently developed
by Grantee; (iii) received from a third party not bound by any confidentiality
agreement with Grantor; (iv) if required for compliance with laws,
rules, regulations or orders of a governmental agency or stock exchange; (v)
to any third party that has a legitimate business need to know the disclosed
information,; or (vi) to a third party to or with which Grantee or its direct
or indirect parent company contemplates a transfer, merger, amalgamation or
other corporate reorganization (a " _Grantee Parent Transaction_ "),
_provided_ that any third party to whom disclosure is made shall first agree
in writing (under which Grantor is a third party beneficiary with the right
to enforce the obligations of such third party directly) to protect the
confidential nature of such information to the same extent Grantee is
obligated under this Section 7.4.

 

7.5. _Press Releases_. Subject to its rights and obligations regarding
confidentiality under Section 7.3, Grantee shall not issue any press release
relating to this Agreement without giving Grantor at least ten (10) Business
Days advance written Notice of the contents of such press release, and
Grantee shall make any reasonable changes to such proposed press release as
such changes may be timely requested by Grantor; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Grantee may (i) include in any press release without Notice any information
previously reported by Grantor and (ii) publish or include any information
related to the Royalty if required for compliance with laws, rules,
regulations or orders of any governmental agency or securities exchange .
Neither Party shall, without the consent of the other Party, issue any press
release that implies or suggests that the non-issuing Party endorses or joins
the issuing Party in statements or representations contained in such press
release. 8\. Assignment.

 

8.1. _Assignment By Grantor_.

 

(a) Any assignment or purported assignment by Grantor of its rights under this
Agreement shall be of no effect and is void ab initio unless: 

(i) Grantee has given its prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed;

 

(ii) such assignment is part of a transaction involving the sale or transfer
of an interest in the Properties; and

 

(iii) the assignee enters into a written agreement by which it assumes, in
favor of Grantee, the obligations of Grantor under this Agreement to the
extent of the interest assigned, in form reasonably acceptable to Grantee.

(b) Subject to an assignment conforming to the requirements of Section
8.1(a), Grantor shall be released from any further obligation under this
Agreement to the extent of the assumption of those obligations by the assignee
and arising after the date of the assignment. Until the release of Grantor
becomes effective, Grantor shall continue to pay the Royalty as if the
assignment had not occurred. Such release shall be without prejudice to any of
the rights of Grantee against Grantor for a breach of this Agreement arising
before the date of the assignment or from any rights intended to survive this
Agreement.

8.2. _Assignment By Grantee_. Grantee may at any time assign or transfer its
rights, title and interest under this Agreement to any person, without
obtaining the consent of Grantor, if such assignment or transfer is evidenced
by written agreement delivered to Grantor, such agreement includes
the details of the assignees address for Notices and;

(a) such assignment or transfer is to any Affiliate of Grantee;

 

(b) such assignment or transfer is part of a Grantee Parent Transaction; or

 

(c) such assignment or transfer is made in accordance with Section 8.3.

 

8.3. _Grantor s Right of First Offer_.

 

(a) If at any time Grantee proposes to effect any sale, transfer, assignment
or other disposition (a " _Disposition_ ") of Grantees Interest to any third
party that is not an Affiliate of Grantee (a " _Potential Acquiring Third
Party_ "), Grantee shall deliver to Grantor a written notice (the " _First
Offer Notice_ ") specifying the material terms of the proposed transaction,
including the name and address of any Potential Acquiring Third Parties and a
proposed cash price for the proposed Disposition. The First Offer Notice shall
constitute an offer by Grantee to sell the Grantees Interests under this
Agreement to Grantor upon the terms set forth in such notice.

(b) In order to accept such offer, Grantor must deliver to Grantee written
notice to such effect (the " _Acceptance Notice_ ") within twenty (20)
Business Days of its receipt of the First Offer Notice. (c) If Grantor shall fail to timely deliver an Acceptance Notice in accordance
with Section 8.3(b), Grantee may proceed with the proposed transaction with
any Potential Acquiring Third Party at any time within six (6) months of the
period of expiration of the time for the giving of the Acceptance Notice (the
" _Sale Period_ "); provided that the terms of such sale, as a whole, are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate to Grantee than those set forth in
the First Offer Notice; provided, further, that if Grantee fails to sell or
otherwise transfer the Grantees Interests during the Sale Period, following
the expiry of such period Grantee shall deliver to Grantor a new First Offer
Notice should it continue to wish, or subsequently decide, to sell or
otherwise transfer the Grantees Interests. Grantee may effect a Disposition
of Grantees Interest for non-cash consideration (" _Non-Cash Consideration_
") if the value thereof exceeds the stated cash price in the First Offer
Notice.

 

(d) In the event that Grantor delivers an Acceptance Notice, then, on such
business day as Grantor shall set forth in the Acceptance Notice (which shall
be not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days after the
delivery thereof) Grantor shall purchase Grantees interests upon the terms
stated in the First Offer Notice.

 

(e) Prior to the Disposition of Grantees Interest to a Potential Acquiring
Third Party for Non-Cash Consideration, Grantee shall submit to Grantor a
calculation of the value of any Non-Cash Consideration proposed to be paid to
Grantee in connection with such Disposition. Within five (5) Business Days of
receiving such calculation, Grantor may give written notice (a "Valuation
Notice") to Grantee that Grantor does not agree that the value of the Non-Cash
consideration exceeds the stated cash price in the First Offer Notice, in
which case the Parties shall endeavor to agree upon such value. If
the Parties cannot reach agreement within five (5) Business Days of the
receipt of the Valuation Notice by the Grantee, the dispute over the value of
the Non-Cash Consideration shall be submitted to an Appraiser within ten (10)
Business Days of the receipt of the Valuation Notice by the Grantee. The
Appraiser shall determine whether the value of the Non-Cash Consideration
exceeds the stated cash price in the First Offer Notice within ten (10)
Business Days of receiving such submission, considering all information that
the Appraiser deems appropriate. The determination of the Appraiser shall be
in writing and shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. All fees and
expenses of the Appraiser shall be borne equally by the Parties.

9\. _Grantor s Purchase Option_.

 

(a) At any time subsequent to the public declaration by Grantor of an ore
reserve with respect to any Royalty Gold (the " _Public Declaration_ ") but
prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the Public Declaration (the "
_Purchase Option Period_ "), Grantor may at its option (the "
_Purchase Option_ ") purchase all of Grantees Interest, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, for an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market
Value (defined below) of Grantees Interest at the time of Grantors exercise
of the Purchase Option _less_ the aggregate amount of Royalty payments made
pursuant to this Agreement after the date of such exercise but prior to the
date of Closing (defined below) (the " _Purchase Price_ "). The Purchase
Option shall be exercisable by Grantors delivery to Grantee, during the
Purchase Option Period, of a written statement of Grantors exercise of the
Purchase Option, including Grantors good faith determination of the Fair
Market Value of Grantees Interest which will include a life of mine plan
which supports such Fair Market Value (the " _FMV Statement_ "). In addition
to a calculation which supports the determination of the Fair Market Value,
the FMV Statement will include a forecast related to the mining of Royalty
Gold and the recovery of Beneficiated Royalty Gold over the anticipated life
of  mine on an annual basis (including as a minimum ore tonnages, gold grades,
dilution factors, extraction ratios and processing recoveries) and will
incorporate the most recently published Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource for
CCandV as well as relevant historical drilling information. Grantee acknowledges
that all such information constitutes projections based on assumptions that
may prove to be inaccurate, that the actual mining of Royalty Gold (if it
occurs) may not occur in accordance with such information, and that the such
information accordingly is provided without warranty of any kind and Grantor
shall have no liability whatsoever to Grantee arising out of or with respect
to such information. If Grantee disputes Grantors determination of the Fair
Market Value of Grantees Interest as stated in the FMV Statement, it shall
within thirty (30) Business days following its receipt of the FMV Statement,
provide to Grantor a written certification of Grantees determination of the
Purchase Price (an " _FMV Dispute Notice_ "). If Grantee fails to timely
deliver an FMV Dispute Notice, the Fair Market Value of Grantees Interest
shall be the amount stated in the FMV Statement. If Grantee timely delivers a
Dispute Notice, Grantor and the Grantee shall endeavor in good faith
expeditiously to agree upon the Fair Market Value of Grantees Interest. If
Grantor and the Grantee do not agree upon the Purchase Price within thirty
(30) days following the date of the FMV Dispute Notice, Grantor and the
Grantee shall cause the Fair Market Value of Grantees Interest to be
determined by an Appraiser. Grantor and the Grantee each shall submit to the
Appraiser their respective final determinations of the Fair Market Value of
Grantees Interest (each a " _Final Valuation_ "). The Appraiser shall resolve
the disagreement as to Fair Market Value, considering all information that
the Appraiser deems appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that in rendering
its determination the Appraiser shall be limited to electing between the Final
Valuation of Fair Market Value tendered to the Appraiser by Grantor and that
tendered to the Appraiser by the Grantee. The determination of the Appraiser
shall be in writing and shall be conclusive and binding on Grantor and the
Grantee. All fees and expenses of the Appraiser shall be borne equally by
Grantor and the Grantee.

(b) Closing of the purchase of the Grantees Interest (" _Closing_ ")
shall occur at a time and location mutually determined by Recipient and the
Company, within forty-five (45) days following the date on which the Fair
Market Value of Grantees Interest is determined in accordance with Section
9(a) or agreed upon by Grantor and Grantee. At Closing, Grantor shall pay the
Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and Grantee
shall execute and deliver to Grantor a written instrument of transfer for
Grantees Interest in form reasonably acceptable to Grantor, warranting title
thereto and the absence of liens and encumbrances with respect thereto.

(c) " _Fair Market Value_ " of Grantees Interest means the price that a
willing buyer would pay and a willing seller would accept for Grantees
Interest as of the date of Grantors exercise of the Purchase Option,
neither party being under any obligation or constraint to consummate such a
transaction within a given period of time.

10\. _General Provisions_.

 

10.1. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented
only by a written agreement signed by each Party.

 

10.2. _Waiver of Rights_. Any waiver of, or consent to depart from, the
requirements of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective only if it
is in writing and signed by the Party giving it, and only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which it has been given. No failure
on the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right. No single
or partial exercise of any such right shall preclude any other or further
exercise of such right or the exercise of any other right. 10.3. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and governed by the
laws of the state of Colorado, without reference to the choice of law or
conflicts of law principles thereof.

10.4. _Dispute Resolution_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
all disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement, or the
construction or enforcement thereof shall be resolved in by arbitration
accordance with this Section. In the event of any such dispute, a Party may
provide a Notice to the other Party summarizing the grounds for the Dispute ("
_Dispute Notice_ "). The Parties shall endeavor to resolve any dispute
amicably by negotiation between a member of senior management of each Party
who has authority to settle the dispute, each of whom is at a higher level of
management than the persons with direct responsibility for administration or
performance of this Agreement. Any dispute that is not resolved by such
negotiation shall be finally determined by arbitration administered by the
international division of the American Arbitration Association, the
International Centre for Dispute Resolution (" _ICDR_ ") in accordance with
its International Arbitration Rules (the " _Rules_ "). Any Party may initiate
such arbitration following thirty (30) days after the delivery of a Dispute
Notice. The place of arbitration shall be Denver, Colorado USA. The
arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. Either Party reserves
the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional
and/or interim relief including pre-arbitral attachments or injunctions and
any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to
arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate; _provided, however_ , that
after the arbitral tribunal is constituted the tribunal shall have sole
jurisdiction to consider applications for provisional and/or interim relief
and any such measures ordered by the arbitration tribunal may be specifically
enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. For disputes involving
amounts of US$5,000,000 or less, the Parties shall attempt, by mutual
agreement, to agree upon a sole arbitrator within thirty (30) days from the
date of the initiating Partys commencement of the arbitration. If the Parties
cannot agree upon a sole arbitrator within such thirty (30) day period, the
ICDR shall make the appointment in accordance with the Rules. In the case of
disputes involving amounts of more than US$5,000,000, the arbitration shall be
conducted by a panel of three arbitrators with one arbitrator being selected
by the initiating Party at the time it commences the arbitration, one
arbitrator being selected by the responding Party within thirty (30) days of
the commencement of the arbitration and the third arbitrator, who shall act as
the presiding arbitrator, being selected by mutual agreement of
the arbitrator selected by the initiating party and the arbitrator selected
by the responding party. If such two arbitrators cannot agree within thirty
(30) days of commencement of the arbitration upon the appointment of the third
arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICDR in accordance
with the Rules. Moreover, if a Party shall fail to appoint an arbitrator
within the specified time period, such arbitrator and the third arbitrator
shall be appointed by the ICDR in accordance with the Rules. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall be
lawyers with at least ten years experience with international commercial
transactions. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any award of the arbitral tribunal
shall be final and binding on the Parties. The Parties undertake to comply
fully and promptly with any award without delay and shall be deemed to have
waived their right to any form of recourse insofar as such waiver can validly
be made.

10.5. _[Intentionally Omitted]_.

 

10.6. _Currency_. Unless specified otherwise, all statements of or references
to dollar amounts in this Agreement are to lawful money of the United States

Agreement shall not be construed to create, expressly or by implication, a
joint venture, mining partnership, commercial partnership, or other
partnership relationship between or among Grantor and Grantee.

 

10.8. _Time_. Time is of the essence of each provision of this Agreement.
