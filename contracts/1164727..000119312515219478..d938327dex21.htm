Party who has authority to settle the dispute, each of whom is at a higher level of management than the persons with direct responsibility for administration or performance of this Agreement. Any dispute that is not resolved by such negotiation

Rules (the &#147;<U>Rules</U>&#148;). Any Party may initiate such arbitration following thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the delivery of a Dispute Notice. The place of arbitration shall be Denver, Colorado USA. The arbitration shall be conducted in the

arbitrator within thirty (30)&nbsp;days from the date of the initiating Party&#146;s commencement of the arbitration. If the Parties cannot agree upon a sole arbitrator within such thirty (30)&nbsp;day period, the ICDR shall make the appointment in

the arbitration, one arbitrator being selected by the responding Party within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the commencement of the arbitration and the third arbitrator, who shall act as the presiding arbitrator, being selected by mutual agreement of the
arbitrator selected by the initiating party and the arbitrator selected by the responding party. If such two arbitrators cannot agree within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of commencement of the arbitration upon the appointment of the third arbitrator, the

accordance with the Rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall be lawyers with at least ten years&#146; experience with international commercial transactions. Judgment upon the award rendered by
the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding on the Parties. The Parties undertake to comply fully and promptly with any award without delay and shall be deemed to
