benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors

hereunder shall be assignable by either Party without the prior written
consent of the other Party; provided, however, Payee may assign its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Payee
without the prior written consent of Payor; provided, further, no such
assignment by Payee shall relieve Payee of any of its obligations hereunder.

5.Amendments and Waivers. All amendments to this Agreement must be in writing
and signed by the Parties. A Party may, only by an instrument in writing,
waive compliance by the other Party with any term or provision of this
Agreement. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any term or provision of
this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no failure to exercise, delay
in exercising, or single or partial exercise of any right, power, or remedy by
a Party, and no course of dealing between the Parties, shall constitute a
waiver of any such right, power, or remedy. 6.Notices. Unless otherwise provided herein, all notices, requests, consents,
