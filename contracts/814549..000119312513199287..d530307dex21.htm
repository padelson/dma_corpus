ARTICLE 2

 

THE MERGER

Section 2.01 _. The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time, MergerSub shall be
merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware
Law, whereupon the separate existence of MergerSub shall cease, and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 (i) at 9.00
a.m. on the third Business Day after the date on which all of the conditions
set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied
or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit of such conditions; _provided_ that, if the Marketing Period has not
ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing), the Closing shall take place on, and, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement that may be deemed to the contrary, Parent and MergerSub
shall not have any obligation whatsoever to consummate the Closing until, the
earlier to occur of (x) a date before or during the Marketing Period specified
by Parent on no fewer than three Business Days written notice to the Company
or (y) the third Business Day immediately following the final day of the
Marketing Period (subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permissible, waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article 9 as of the
date determined pursuant to this proviso) or (ii) at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree
in writing. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to
herein as the "Closing Date."

 



11 (c) At the Closing, the Company and MergerSub shall file a certificate of
merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such
later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and MergerSub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time:

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or
Section 2.04, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $20.00 in
cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be
paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Merger Consideration payable to the Raina Investors pursuant to
this Section 2.02(a) in respect of the shares of Company Stock owned by such
Raina Investors immediately prior to the Effective Time shall only be paid to
the extent, and otherwise on the terms and subject to the conditions, set
forth in the Investment Letter Agreement.

 

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent or MergerSub immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares held for the account of clients, customers or other Persons), and the
Rollover Shares, shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

 

(c) Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number
of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary
owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned
in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Each share of common stock of MergerSub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges
as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (except for any such shares
resulting from the conversion of shares of Company Stock pursuant to Section
2.02(c)).

 



12 Section 2.03 _. Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
(i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares").
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit in cash with the
Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of all of the
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares representing shares of Company
Stock entitled to payment pursuant to Section 2.02(a) (collectively, the
"Aggregate Merger Consideration"). For the avoidance of doubt, such amounts
on deposit with the Exchange Agent shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments due pursuant to Section 2.02(a). The Aggregate Merger
Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent shall, pending its
disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by
Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors respectively, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
the investment. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced
by, such amounts on deposit with the Exchange Agent will be payable to Parent
or as Parent otherwise directs. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent)
for use in such exchange.

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each share of
Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until
so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper

  



13  form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred
and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent
any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock one
year after the Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation,
and any such holder who has not exchanged such shares of Company Stock for
the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any
holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for Dissenting Shares for which
appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand.

 

Section 2.04 _. Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares of Company Stock in
accordance with Delaware Law (such shares, "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal.
If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of
Company Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to

 



14  such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any
such demands.

 

Section 2.05 _. Stock Awards._ (a) At or immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each then outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Stock under
any Company Stock Plan (a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable
or vested, shall be canceled, and the Company shall pay each such holder at or
promptly after the Effective Time for each such option an amount in cash
determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the applicable exercise price of such option by (ii) the number of shares
of Company Stock such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of
all options) had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ that any amounts payable to Mr. Robin Raina
pursuant to this Section 2.05(a) in respect of Company Stock Options owned by
Mr. Raina at or immediately prior to the Effective Time shall only be paid to
the extent, and otherwise on the terms and subject to the conditions, set
forth in the Investment Letter Agreement.

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Stock that
was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that was subject to
vesting or other restrictions pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (a "Company
Restricted Stock Award") shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable, and
such share shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance pursuant to Section 2.02(a); _provided_ that any
amounts payable to Mr. Robin Raina pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) in respect
of such shares of Company Stock owned by Mr. Raina immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall only be paid to the extent, and otherwise on the terms
and subject to the conditions, set forth in the Investment Letter Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors (acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) and its compensation
committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolution and take all such actions
as are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section 2.05, including: (i) obtaining any necessary consents from holders of
Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards for the cancellation
of the Company Stock Options and the conversion of the Company Restricted
Stock Awards and (ii) make any amendments to the terms of such Company Stock
Options or Company Restricted Stock Awards as contemplated by this Section
2.05 that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Section 2.05. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.05,
payment may be withheld in respect of any Company Stock Option or Company
Restricted Stock Award until such necessary consents are obtained. All amounts
payable pursuant to Section 2.05 shall be subject to any applicable
withholding.

 

Section 2.06 _. Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the

 



15  Company shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class or number of classes of shares, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise of
Company Stock Options, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.07 _. Withholding Rights. _ Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange
Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.08 _. Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2.

ARTICLE 3

From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or

ARTICLE 4

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

Subject to Section 11.05, except as disclosed in any Company SEC Document
filed after December 31, 2011, but before the date of this Agreement or as
set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and
warrants, on the date hereof and on the Closing Date, to Parent as follows:

 

Section 4.01 _. Corporate Existence and Power._ The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all governmental
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on
its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations,
permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company has previously made available to
Parent true and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company as currently in effect.

Section 4.02 _. Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which the Company is a party and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for the approval of the Companys stockholders in
connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock
is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger (the "Company
Stockholder Approval"). Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the other parties hereto, this Agreement and each of the
other Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (subject, in the case of enforceability, to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights generally and to general
principles of equity).

 



17 (b) At a meeting duly called and held, a special committee (the
"Special Committee") of the Companys Board of Directors (the "Board of
Directors") and the Board of Directors (acting on the recommendation of the
Special Committee) has (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the
Companys stockholders, (ii) unanimously approved, adopted and declared
advisable this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the
Company is a party and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and
(iii) unanimously resolved, subject to Section 6.03, to recommend approval and
adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation, the
"Company Recommendation").

Section 4.03 _. Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which the Company is a party and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the
filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
other states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (ii)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act, (iii) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, and any other
applicable state or federal securities laws, (iv) compliance with any
applicable requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ") and (v) any
actions or filings the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

Section 4.04 _. Non-Contravention._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which the Company is a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will not (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene,
conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any
Applicable Law, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 4.03, require any consent or other action by any Person under,
constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the
termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its

operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and its

prohibits the counterparty thereto from confidentially requesting the Company
or such Subsidiary to amend or waive the standstill provision in such
agreement ( _i.e._ , a "dont ask, dont waive" provision) to the extent
necessary (and only to such extent) to enable such counterparty to convey

set forth in this Section 6.03(b).

 

(c) _Exceptions to No-Shop Prohibitions_.

(i) _Exception for Diligence and Discussions._ Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, if at any time after the No-Shop Period Start
Date and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or
any of its Representatives has received a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition
Proposal, then (x) the Company (directly or through its Representatives) may
make inquiries solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition
Proposal, and only to the extent necessary for such purpose) and (y) if the
Board of Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
reasonably believes such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company,
directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A) engage in
negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives and
(B) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that all such information (to the extent
that such information has not been previously provided or made available to
Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to
or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available
to such Third Party).

 



49 (ii) _Exception for Superior Proposal._ Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, if the Company has received a Superior Proposal then the Board of
Directors, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, may,
subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), make an Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 10.01(d)(iii) in order to enter into a definitive
Alternative Acquisition Agreement in respect of such Superior Proposal.

(iii) _Exception for Other Events. _ Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, if the Board of Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law, the Board of Directors may (A)
approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested
stockholder" under, Section 203 of Delaware Law on a conditional basis in
order to evaluate whether a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal
received by the Company or any of its Representatives would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal under Section 6.03(c)(i)(y) or (B)
in response to an Intervening Event, and subject to compliance with Section
6.03(d), make an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(iv) _Compliance with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)._ In addition, nothing
contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) from complying with Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal so
long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with
this Section 6.03; _provided_ that any such action taken or statement made
that relates to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a customary "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Board of Directors pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
of the 1934 Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless
the Board of Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such statement or in
connection with such action.

(d) _"_ _Last Look"_. Further, the Board of Directors shall not make an
Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 6.03(c)(ii) or (c)(iii)
(and, in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following
receipt of a Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 6.03(c)(ii), shall not
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.01(d)(iii) in order to enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition
Agreement in respect thereof), unless: (i) the Company promptly notifies
Parent, in writing at least four Business Days before taking that action
(such four Business Day period, the "Negotiation

 



50  Period"), of its intention to do so, (ii) (A) in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a Superior Proposal
pursuant to Section 6.03(c)(ii), such notice specifies in reasonable detail
the basis for the Adverse Recommendation Change and attaches the most current
version of the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is
proposed to be consummated and the identity of the third party making the
Acquisition Proposal, or (B) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change
to be made in response to an Intervening Event pursuant to Section
6.03(c)(iii), such notice includes a reasonably detailed description of the
reasons for making such Adverse Recommendation Change, (iii) during the
Negotiation Period, the Company negotiates, and causes its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent with respect to any proposed changes by
Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and, if applicable, the
other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(or with respect to other proposals made by Parent), _and_ (iv) Parent does
not make, within the Negotiation Period, an offer that (A) in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a Superior
Proposal pursuant to Section 6.03(c)(ii), is at least as favorable to
the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written
notification from the Company and a new three Business Day period (which
shall also be deemed to be a "Negotiation Period") under this Section
6.03(d)), or (B) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made in
response to an Intervening Event pursuant to Section 6.03(c)(iii), obviates
the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change.

(e) _Certain Other Required Notices_.

(i) None of the Board of Directors, the Special Committee, any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, shall take
any of the actions referred to in Section 6.03(c) unless the Company shall
have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action, and, after taking any action referred to in
Section 6.03(c), the Company shall continue to advise Parent on a reasonably
current basis of the status and terms of any discussions and negotiations with
the Third Party.

 

(ii) In addition, at any time on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date until
the Effective Time, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event

Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a Third
Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request
for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that could reasonably be expected
to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide the
notice provided for in the

 



51  immediately preceding sentence orally and in writing and shall identify the
Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. On and after the No-Shop Period Start Date,
the Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of the
status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request,
and shall promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt)
provide to Parent copies of all material correspondence and written materials
sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that describes any
terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries
of any material oral communications addressing such matters).

(iii) Without limiting its obligations pursuant to the preceding Section
6.03(e), (A) on the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent
of the number of Excluded Parties and provide Parent with a written summary of
the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal received from
any Excluded Party (which material terms and conditions shall include the
identity of the Third Party or group of Third Parties making the Acquisition
Proposal and shall include, if applicable, copies of all drafts of

55 ARTICLE 7

COVENANTS OF PARENT

Parent agrees that:

Section 7.01 _. Obligations of MergerSub._ Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause MergerSub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 7.02 _. Voting of Shares._ Parent shall vote all shares of Company
Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption
of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

Section 7.03 _. Director and Officer Liability._ Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of
the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted
by Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ that such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period of time at or prior to the Effective Time with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are not materially less favorable in
the aggregate than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that
(x) the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the

 



56  selection of such tail policy and the Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto, (y)
in no event shall the Company or the Surviving Corporation be required or
permitted to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 250% of the amount per annum the Company paid in
its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth in Section 7.03(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (z) if the aggregate premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount and the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall obtain a policy in accordance with
this sentence, such policy shall provide the greatest coverage available,
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are not materially less favorable in the
aggregate than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as
of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase DandO Insurance
for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies
pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 250% of the
amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount
is set forth in Section 7.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and
_provided, further,_ that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.03.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 



57 Section 7.04. _Employee Matters_. (a) For the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Company Employees, to the
extent that and for such time as such Company Employees remain employed with
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, compensation and
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to that provided
to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, excluding any
equity, change of control or other transaction-based compensation, long term
incentive awards, supplemental pension benefits and deferred compensation
programs.

 

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (other than for
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under the
compensation and benefit plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of the
Surviving Corporation providing benefits to any Company Employee after the
Effective Time, and in which such Company Employee did not participate prior
to the Effective Time (each a "New Plan"), each Company Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Affiliates
(and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing,
to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing,
to credit for such service under any similar employee benefit plan maintained
or sponsored by the Company or its Subsidiaries, except where such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits. For purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, prescription, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee except to the extent
such pre-existing conditions and actively-at-work requirements would apply
under any analogous Company Employee Plan, and Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents under a Company Employee Plan
during the portion of the plan year prior to the Closing to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-
insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Company Employee for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) nothing
herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any Company
Employee, or to restrict the right of the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Company Service Provider, (ii)
the provisions of this Section 7.04 are solely for the benefit of the parties
to this Agreement, and no current or former Company Employee or other Company
Service Provider or other individual associated therewith or any employee
benefit plan or trustee thereof shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as
an amendment to any employee benefit plan for any purpose. In addition,
nothing in 

 



58  this Agreement shall be construed to limit the right of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to amend or terminate any
employee benefit plan in accordance with the terms thereof.

rights under the Equity Commitment Letter to the extent set forth in Section

deemed to include such private placement); _provided, however_ , that (1)
Parent 

 



61  and MergerSub shall not release or waive the Debt Commitment Letters or the
obligations of the arrangers and lenders thereunder and (2) Parent and
MergerSub shall proceed with, and consummate, the financing contemplated in
the Debt Financing Letters in the event that such alternative private
placement financing is not available. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the

agreements related to the Debt Financing, or default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing or (4) material dispute between or
among any parties to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of any of the Debt
Commitment Letters, in each case, with respect to the obligation to fund the
Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at Closing and
(z) of the receipt of any notice or other communication (written or verbal) on
the basis of which Parent expects that a party to the Debt Financing will
fail to fund the Debt Financing or is reducing the amount of the Debt
Financing; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or MergerSub be under any
obligation to disclose any information pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) that
would waive the protection of attorney-client or similar privilege if such
party shall have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in
a way that would not waive such privilege. As soon as reasonably practicable,
but in any event within five Business Days of the date the Company delivers
to Parent or MergerSub a written request, Parent and MergerSub shall provide
any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clauses (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately

(including the flex provisions), (A) Parent shall promptly notify the Company
and (B) Parent and MergerSub shall use their reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain any such portion from alternative sources, on terms, taken
as whole, that are no more adverse to Parent and the Company (including after
giving effect to the market flex provisions), as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event but in no event later than the last
day of the Marketing Period. In furtherance of the provisions of this Section
8.03, one or more Debt Commitment Letters may be amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified or superseded at the option of Parent

62  Effective Time by instruments (the "New or Amended Debt Commitment Letters")
that either amend, amend and restate, or replace the existing Debt Commitment
Letters or contemplate co-investment by or financing from one or more other
or additional parties; _provided_ that the terms of the New or Amended Debt
Commitment Letters shall not (1) expand upon the conditions precedent to the
Debt Financing as set forth in the existing Debt Commitment Letters, (2)
reasonably be expected to materially delay or hinder the Closing or (3) reduce
the aggregate amount of available Debt Financing. Parent shall (x) to the
extent reasonably practicable, notify the Company of its intention to make
any such amendment or obtain such alternative financing and keep the Company
reasonably informed of the terms thereof and (y) provide to the Company final
drafts of all New or Amended Debt Commitment Letters prior to their execution
by Parent so as to permit the Company a reasonable period of time in which to
confirm that such proposed New or Amended Debt Commitment Letters comply with
the this Section 8.03(a). Parent shall deliver to the Company true and
correct copies of all New or Amended Debt Commitment Letters (including
redacted fee and engagement letters in respect of any New or Amended Debt
Commitment Letters). In such event, the term "Debt Commitment Letters"
as used herein shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters that
are not so superseded at the time in question and the New or Amended Debt
Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect and the term "Debt Financing"
as used herein shall be deemed to include the debt financing contemplated by
any such New or Amended Debt Commitment Letters. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Marketing Period" shall mean a period of 15 consecutive Business
Days following receipt by Parent of the Required Information which is
Compliant, during which (A) no event has occurred and no conditions exist that

satisfied before the Closing (assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for
any time during such 15 Business Day period) and (B) the conditions set forth
in Section 9.01 have been satisfied (other than conditions that by their
nature can only be satisfied at the Closing); _provided_ , _however_ , that
(x) such period shall exclude the days from July 3, 2013 to and including July
7, 2013, (y) the entirety of such period shall occur prior to August 17, 2013
or after September 2, 2013 and (z) the "Marketing Period" shall not be deemed
to have commenced if, prior to the completion of such 15 consecutive Business
Day period, Parent has received a notice from the Debt Financing sources
in accordance with paragraph 13 of Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter
that (a) the Required Information has not been delivered and (b) specifying
any additional Required Information to be provided. "Compliant" shall mean,
with respect to any Required Information, that such Required Information (i)
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact regarding the Company necessary in order to made such
Required Information not misleading, (ii) is, and remains throughout the

Section 11.02 _. Survival of Representations and Warranties._
The representations and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or
other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

Section 11.03 _. Amendments and Waivers._ (a) Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ that, after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be no amendment or waiver
that would require the further approval of the stockholders of the Company
under Delaware Law without such approval having first been obtained.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, no DFS Provision
may be amended or waived without the consent of the Debt Financing sources.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or

herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 



76 Section 11.04 _. Expenses._ (a) _General_. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense.

(b) _Company Termination Fee; Reimbursement of Reimbursable Expenses_.

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to any clause of
Section 10.01(c)(i), then the Company shall pay to Parent (or one or more
designees of Parent) the Company Termination Fee. 

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i) or Section 10.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section
10.01(c)(ii), (B) after the date of this Agreement and prior to such
termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
otherwise been communicated to the Companys stockholders at or prior to the
Company Stockholder Meeting and not publicly withdrawn on an unconditional
basis and (C) within 12 months following the date of such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive written agreement for, or consummates, any
Acquisition Proposal (except that, for purposes of this clause (C), each
reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed
to be a reference to "50%"), then the Company shall pay to Parent (or one or
more designees of Parent) the Company Termination Fee.

(iii) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
10.01(d)(iii), then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to
Parent or one or more of Parents designees in the manner and at the time
required by Section 11.04(d)(i).

"Company Termination Fee" shall mean, (i) $15,539,000 if the
Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(iii) due to a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(iii) by the Company
prior to the Cut-Off Date in order to enter into a definitive Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with an Excluded Party, and (ii) $27,193,000 in all
other circumstances. The parties agree and acknowledge that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

 



77 (c) _Parent Termination Fee_. If this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to (i) Section 10.01(d)(ii) and there is no state of facts or
circumstances (other than a state of facts or circumstances caused by a breach
of Parents or MergerSubs representations and warranties or covenants and
other agreements hereunder) that would reasonably be expected to cause the
conditions in Section 9.01 and Section 9.02 not to be satisfied on or prior to
the End Date or (ii) Section 10.01(d)(ii), then Parent shall pay or cause to
be paid to the Company $45,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee").

(d) _Manner of Fee Payments_. Any payment of the Company Termination Fee, the
Parent Termination Fee or any other amount due under this Section 11.04 upon a
termination of the Agreement, other than Reimbursable Expenses, which shall be
paid in accordance with Section 11.04(e), shall be paid (i) simultaneously
with, and as a condition precedent to, such termination in the case of a
payment due pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(iii), (ii) in the case of payments
due pursuant to Section 11.04(b)(ii), promptly, and in any event within two
Business Days of, the occurrence of the applicable event described in clause
(C) thereof and (iii) in all other cases, promptly, and in any event within
two Business Days of, such termination, in each case by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by the
recipient party.

(e) _Reimbursement of Reimbursable Expenses_. If this Agreement is terminated
by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii) or by Parent
pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(ii), then the Company shall reimburse Parent for
all of its Reimbursable Expenses up to a maximum aggregate amount of
$4,500,000. Any reimbursement of Reimbursable Expenses by the Company shall
occur promptly after, but in any event within two Business Days of, delivery
of invoices and other reasonable documentation by Parent to the Company with
respect to such Reimbursable Expenses, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent and shall be
credited against any Company Termination Fee which subsequently becomes
payable.

(f) _Other Costs and Expenses_. The Company and Parent each acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 11.04 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if
either the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay any
amount due to the other party pursuant to this Section 11.04, it shall also
pay any costs and expenses incurred by such other party in connection with
a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against
it for such amount, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee,
cost or expense, from the date such fee, cost or expense was required to be
paid to (but excluding) the payment date, at the prime rate as published in
the _Wall Street Journal_ on the date that such payment was required to be
made.

 



78 Section 11.05 _. Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References._ (a)The
parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in
the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations
and warranties of the Company that are contained in this Agreement, but only
if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent
to a reasonable person who has read that reference and such representations
and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader
regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.

(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of
any Company SEC Document shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) the Companys representations and warranties if
the relevance of that information as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent
to a person who has read that information concurrently with such
representations and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part
of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed; _provided_ that in no
event shall any information contained in any part of any Company SEC Document
entitled "Risk Factors" or containing any "Forward Looking Statements," or any
other statements that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in
nature, be deemed to be an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) any
representations or warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement.

 

Section 11.06 _. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._ (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 7.03,
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.03, no provision of
this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Debt Financing source shall be an express third party
beneficiary with respect to Section 10.02(b), Section 11.03, this Section
11.06, Section 11.08(b), Section 11.09 and Section 11.13(iii) (the "DFS
Provisions").

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or MergerSub may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
(i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the Effective
Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment shall not
relieve Parent or MergerSub of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or
change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or
MergerSub. 

 



79 Section 11.07 _. Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 

Section 11.08 _. Jurisdiction._ (a) The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement, any other
Transaction Document (other than the Debt Commitment Letters) or any
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (whether brought by any party
or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall
be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other
Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that that it will
not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing
sources in any way relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof, in any forum
other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or,
if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom). The parties hereto
agree that process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process
on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service
of process on such party.

 

Section 11.09 _. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING).

Section 11.10 _. Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and 

 



80  unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

Section 11.11 _. Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents together constitute the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 11.12 _. Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.13 _. Specific Performance. _ Subject to the remainder of this
Section 11.13, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity; _provided_
that it is acknowledged and agreed by each party that:

(i) the Company shall only be entitled to specific performance of the Parents
obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the
Merger, and then only in the event that each of the following conditions has
been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Article 9 have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that, by their terms, are to
be satisfied at the Closing or the failure of which is caused by a material
breach by Parent or MergerSub of this Agreement, (ii) the third Business Day
after the final day of the Marketing Period shall have occurred, (iii) the
Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, (iv) Parent and MergerSub fail to complete
the Closing in accordance with Section 2.01, and (v) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that if specific performance
is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Closing will occur; _provided_ that, for the

 



81  avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically Parents obligations to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has
not been funded or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing
is funded at the Closing;

(ii) under no circumstance shall the Company be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance pursuant to this Section 11.13
and payment of the Parent Termination Fee or other amounts payable pursuant
to Section 11.04; and

(iii) in no event shall the Company be entitled to, or permitted to seek,
specific performance in respect of any Debt Financing source or any other
Financing source, and nor shall there be any right of the Company or any
obligation of Parent or any of its Affiliates to enforce specifically any of
its or their respective rights under any Financing Commitment Letters or any
other agreements relating to the Financing, except in each case in the limited
circumstances expressly set forth in this Section 11.13 with respect to the
Equity Financing sources; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 11.13 shall
prevent the Company from seeking and obtaining specific performance against
the Limited Guarantor under the Limited Guaranty to the extent expressly
permitted under, and in accordance with, the terms and conditions set forth
therein and herein.
