REORGANIZATION    This AMENDED AND RESTATED MERGER AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
REORGANIZATION is made and entered into as of December 6, 2000 (the
"Amendment Date"), by and among BROADCOM CORPORATION, a California
corporation ("Broadcom"), and SIBYTE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), and, with respect to Article 7 and Article 9 only, Leo A. Joseph,
as Stockholder Agent, and U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation, as Depositary
Agent. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the
meanings set forth in Article 10.   RECITALS   A. Broadcom and the Company
and, with respect to Article 7 and Article 9 thereof only, Leo A. Joseph, as
Stockholder Agent, and U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation, as Depositary Agent,
have previously entered into that certain Merger Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Original Agreement") dated as of November 3, 2000 which
provides, among other things, for Broadcom to acquire the Company pursuant to
the merger of the Company with and into Broadcom.   B. Broadcom and the
Company and, with respect to Article 7 and Article 9 thereof only, Leo A.
Joseph, as Stockholder Agent, and U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation, as
Depositary Agent, desire to amend and restated the Original Agreement.   C.
The Boards of Directors of each of Broadcom and the Company believe it is in
the best interests of Broadcom and the Company (as applicable) and
their respective shareholders that Broadcom acquire the Company through the
merger of the Company with and into Broadcom (the "Merger") and, in
furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   D. Prior to the Effective Time, all
outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock will be converted into
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.   E. Pursuant to the Merger,
among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (i) all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock which
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Class A common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Broadcom ("Broadcom Common Stock") and
(ii) all Company Options, Company Warrants and Company Stock Purchase Rights
then outstanding (whether vested or unvested) will become exercisable for
Broadcom Common Stock, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein.   F. As a condition and an inducement to the willingness of Broadcom
to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have
entered into (i) Support Agreements with Broadcom in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A ("Support    -1-  9  Agreements") pursuant
to which, among other things, such stockholders have agreed to vote the
shares of Company Capital Stock owned by them in favor of the Merger and to
convert, prior to the Effective Time, the shares of Company Preferred Stock
owned by them, if any, into shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) Company
Affiliate Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B
("Company Affiliate Agreements").   G. As a condition and a further
inducement to Broadcom to enter into this Agreement, certain employees of the
Company have entered into Non-Competition Agreements substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the "Non-Competition Agreements"), each of
which shall become effective at the Effective Time.   H. Broadcom and the
Company intend that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and in furtherance
thereof intend that this Agreement shall be a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Sections 354(a) and 361(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.  
I. The Company and Broadcom desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger.   J. A portion of the shares of Broadcom Common Stock otherwise
issuable by Broadcom in connection with the Merger shall be placed in escrow
by Broadcom, the release of which amount shall be contingent upon certain
events and conditions, all as set forth in Article 7 herein.   K. An
additional portion of the shares of Broadcom Common Stock otherwise issuable
by Broadcom in connection with the Merger or which are issued upon
the exercise of Company Options after the Effective Time shall be placed in
escrow by Broadcom, the release of which amount shall be contingent upon
certain events and conditions, all as set forth in Article 1 herein.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises, representations and
warranties set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration
(the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by the
parties), intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree
as follows:   ARTICLE 1  THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. At the Effective
Time and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of the California Code and Delaware Law, the
Company shall be merged with and into Broadcom, the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall cease, and Broadcom shall continue as the
surviving corporation. Broadcom is sometimes referred to herein as the
"Surviving Corporation."   1.2 Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is
earlier terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") is expected to take place on or about December 10, 2000 and will
take place no later than five Business Days following    -2- 
10  satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7, at the
offices of Irell and Manella LLP, 1800 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 900, Los
Angeles, California, unless another place or time is agreed to by Broadcom
and the Company. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs is herein
referred to as the "Closing Date." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing an Agreement of Merger (or
like instrument), in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D-1
(the "California Agreement of Merger"), with the Secretary of State of the
State of California, and the filing of a Certificate of Merger (or like
instrument), in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D-2 (the
"Delaware Certificate of Merger"), with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, in each case in accordance with the relevant provisions of
applicable law (the time of acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware of such filing or such later time as may be agreed to by the
parties and set forth in the Delaware Certificate of Merger being referred to
herein as the "Effective Time").   1.3 Effect of the Merger on Constituent
Corporations. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Broadcom and the
Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of Broadcom and the
Company shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4 Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Surviving Corporation.   (a) At the Effective
Time, the articles of incorporation of Broadcom, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) At
the Effective Time, the bylaws of Broadcom, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by such bylaws, the articles of incorporation
and applicable law.   1.5 Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation.
The directors of Broadcom immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
The officers of Broadcom immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   1.6 Maximum Number of Shares of
Broadcom Common Stock to be Issued; Effect on Outstanding Securities of the
Company. The maximum number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be issued
(including Broadcom Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of
any of the Company Options, Company Warrants (if any) or Company Stock
Purchase Rights to be assumed by Broadcom as provided herein) in exchange for
the acquisition by Broadcom of all shares of Company Capital Stock which are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and all vested
and unvested    -3-  11  Company Options, Company Warrants (if any) and
Company Stock Purchase Rights which are then outstanding (other than Company
Warrants which by their terms expire without payment, conversion, adjustment
or other consideration at the Effective Time) shall not exceed the Aggregate
Share Number. No adjustment shall be made in the number of shares of Broadcom
Common Stock issued in the Merger as a result of any consideration (in any
form whatsoever) received by the Company from the date hereof to the
Effective Time as a result of any exercise, conversion or exchange of Company
Options, Company Warrants or Company Stock Purchase Rights. On the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Broadcom, the Company or
the holder of any shares of the Company Capital Stock or Company Options,
Company Warrants or Company Stock Purchase Rights, the following shall
occur:   (a) Conversion of Company Capital Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock (assuming conversion of all outstanding shares of
Company Preferred Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as provided in Section
1.10)) will be cancelled and extinguished and each share of Company Common
Stock which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive, following the
expiration or early termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act which
is applicable to the holder of such share, at the Effective Time, that number
of shares of Broadcom Common Stock equal to the sum of (i) the Exchange Ratio
and (ii) the Earn-Out Exchange Ratio (subject to Section 1.9 and Section
1.14).   (b) Cancellation of Broadcom-Owned and Company-Owned Stock.
Each share of Company Common Stock owned by Broadcom or the Company or any
Subsidiary of Broadcom or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof and without any further action on the part of Broadcom or the
Company.   (c) Capital Stock of Broadcom. Each share of Broadcom Common
Stock and share of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
Broadcom which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain outstanding as one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of the same class of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation, with identical rights and privileges. From and after the
Effective Time, each share certificate of Broadcom theretofore evidencing
ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (d) Company
Options, Company Warrants and Company Stock Plans. All unexpired and
unexercised Company Options, Company Warrants and Company Stock Purchase
Rights, then outstanding, whether vested or unvested, together with
the Company Stock Plans, shall be assumed by Broadcom in accordance with
the provisions set forth below.   (i) Each unexpired and unexercised
Company Option, Company Warrant and Company Stock Purchase Right then
outstanding, whether vested or    -4-  12  unvested, shall be, in
connection with the Merger, assumed by Broadcom, together with the Company
Stock Plans. Each Company Option, Company Warrant and Company Stock Purchase
Right so assumed by Broadcom under this Agreement shall, except as provided
in Section 1.6(d)(iii), continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms
and conditions as were applicable to such Company Option, Company Warrant or
Company Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), provided that
(x), with respect to a Company Option or Company Stock Purchase Right, (A)
such Company Option or Company Stock Purchase Right, as the case may be,
shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Broadcom Common Stock
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Capital Stock that
were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option or Company Stock Purchase
Right immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming such Company Option
or Company Stock Purchase Right were exercisable in full) multiplied by the
sum of the Exchange Ratio and the Earn-Out Exchange Ratio (rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock) and (B) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Broadcom Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such assumed Company Option or Company Stock Purchase Right, as
the case may be, shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Capital Stock at which such Company
Option or Company Stock Purchase Right was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the sum of the Exchange Ratio and the Earn-Out Exchange
Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) and (y) with respect to a
Company Warrant, (A) such Company Warrant shall be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of Broadcom Common Stock equal to the product of
the number of shares of Company Capital Stock that were issuable upon
exercise of such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time
(assuming such Company Warrant were exercisable in full) multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Broadcom Common Stock) and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Broadcom Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Warrant
shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Capital Stock at which such Company Warrant was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent). It is the intention of the parties that the Company
Options assumed by Broadcom shall qualify following the Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code to the same extent the Company Options qualified as incentive stock
options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the provisions of this
Section 1.6(d) shall be applied consistent with this intent. In the event of
a final determination that one or more Earn-Out Milestones shall not be
satisfied pursuant to Section 1.14 and thus that the Earn-Out Exchange Ratio
shall not be fully earned, then the number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock
for which a Company Option is exercisable and the exercise price therefore
shall be adjusted proportionately.   (ii) Broadcom shall assume the
Company\'s obligations, and shall be assigned the Company\'s repurchase
rights and purchase options, under any Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements
entered into pursuant to the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1998 Company
Stock Plan"), the 2000 Key Employee Stock Plan (the "2000 Company Stock Plan"
and together with the 1998 Company Stock Plan, the "Company Stock Plans") and
the other restricted stock purchase agreements listed on Schedule 1.6(d)(ii)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Founders Stock Agreements"), true
and    -5-  13  correct copies of which have been made available by the
Company to Broadcom. Except as provided in Section 1.6(d)(iii), any and all
restrictions on the Company Restricted Stock issued pursuant to the Company
Stock Plans or such other agreements which do not lapse in accordance with
their terms (as in effect on September 5, 2000) shall continue in full force
and effect until such restrictions lapse pursuant to the terms of such
agreements, and any repurchase rights or repurchase options which the Company
has with respect to the Company Restricted Stock shall also continue in full
force and effect; provided, however, that the per share repurchase price for
the shares of Broadcom Common Stock that were issued in exchange for Company
Restricted Stock shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
per share repurchase price of such Company Restricted Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the sum of the Exchange Ratio and the Earn-Out
Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole cent) and subject to an
appropriate adjustment if any of the Earn-Out Milestones are not
satisfied).   (iii) The Company agrees to take all actions necessary
or advisable to cause all Company Options, Company Warrants, Company Stock
Purchase Rights and Company Restricted Stock to remain unchanged except (A)
for the conversion into options, warrants or rights to purchase shares of
Broadcom Common Stock as provided for in this Section 1.6(d), (B) that any
acceleration of vesting, continuation of vesting after termination of
employment or other special vesting (whether with the passage of time, upon
the occurrence of certain events or otherwise) that might occur, result from
or be related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements shall be prevented from occurring through the
modification, through an amendment in substantially the forms of Exhibits E-1
and E-2, as applicable, of the applicable Company Option, Company Warrant,
Company Stock Purchase Right or Company Restricted Stock (and any employment
agreement or other agreement providing for such acceleration) prior to the
date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions in
clause (B) of this Section 1.6(d)(iii) shall not apply to Company Options,
Company Warrants, Company Stock Purchase Rights or Company Restricted Stock
or such portions of such Company Options, Company Warrants, Company Stock
Purchase Rights or Company Restricted Stock, to the extent set forth in
Section 1.6(d)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (C) each such
Company Option, Company Warrant, Company Stock Purchase Right or Company
Restricted Stock (other than a Permitted Grant) or such portions of such
Company Options, Company Stock Purchase Rights or Company Restricted
Stock that is required to be modified pursuant to the provisions of clause
(B) of this Section 1.6(d)(iii) shall be further modified, through an
amendment in substantially the form of Exhibits E-1 and E-2, as applicable,
prior to the Effective Time to provide for vesting acceleration in the event
that the employment of the holder of such Company Option, Company Stock
Purchase Right or Company Restricted Stock is terminated (x) in the case of
employees other than the Founders, without Cause within the twenty-four (24)
months immediately following the Effective Time and (y) in the case of the
Founders is terminated without cause or is constructively terminated in
accordance with Exhibit E-1; provided in each case that such acceleration of
vesting shall only be for the portion that would have accelerated or
continued under the applicable Company Option, Company Stock Purchase Right
or Company Restricted Stock prior to such modification pursuant to clause (B)
of this Section 1.6(d)(iii).    -6-  14   (iv) The shares of Broadcom
Common Stock received upon exercise of a Company Option after the Effective
Time that relate to the Earn-Out Exchange Ratio and for which an Earn-Out
Milestone has not been satisfied (plus a proportionate share of any
additional shares of Broadcom Common Stock as may be issued upon any stock
splits, stock dividends or recapitalizations effected by Broadcom following
the exercise of such Company Option) shall be held in escrow (each, an
"Option Escrow") by Broadcom (or its nominee) pending satisfaction of such
Earn-Out Milestone and shall be released from such Option Escrow only upon
satisfaction of such Earn-Out Milestone by the applicable Earn-Out Date.
Promptly following the final determination of the amount (if any) of an Earn-
Out, the Person who exercised the Company Option after the Effective Time
shall be entitled to receive from such Option Escrow the number of whole
shares of Broadcom Common Stock to which such holder is entitled as a result
of the satisfaction of such Earn-Out Milestone. If it is finally determined
that any portion of an Earn-Out has not been and can not be satisfied and
thus will not be distributed from the Option Escrows or the Earn-Out Escrow
as set forth in Section 1.11 and Section 1.14, then the appropriate portion
of the shares of Broadcom Common Stock held in such Option Escrow shall be
forfeited and shall be released and returned for cancellation to Broadcom
from such Option Escrow. In addition, the shares of Broadcom Common Stock
received upon exercise of a Company Option after the Effective Time
that relate to the Earn-Out Exchange Ratio (A) shall be subject to the
same forfeiture provisions and the same rights of repurchase in favor of the
Company (as assigned pursuant to this Agreement to, and assumed by, Broadcom)
as the other shares acquired upon exercise of such Company Option and (B)
shall vest proportionately with the other shares underlying such Company
Option in accordance with the same vesting schedule applicable to such other
shares. Releases of shares of Broadcom Common Stock from the Option Escrows
shall be performed in a manner consistent with Section 1.14(c).   (v) Any
New Shares in respect of Broadcom Common Stock in the Option Escrows which
have not been released from the Option Escrows shall be added to the Option
Escrows. New Shares issued in respect of shares of Broadcom Common Stock
which have been released from the Option Escrows shall not be added to the
Option Escrows but shall be distributed to the record holders thereof. Cash
dividends on Broadcom Common Stock shall not be added to the Option
Escrows but shall be distributed to the record holders of the Broadcom Common
Stock on the record date set for any such dividend. Each stockholder shall
have voting rights with respect to the shares of Broadcom Common Stock
contributed to the Option Escrows by such stockholder (and on any voting
securities added to the Option Escrows in respect of such shares of Broadcom
Common Stock).   (vi) Any dispute with respect to the Option Escrows
shall be resolved in a manner consistent with the dispute resolution
procedures set forth in Section 1.14.   (vii) The provisions of Sections
7.2(h), (i) and (k) shall apply to any acts taken by the Stockholder Agent
pursuant to this Section 1.6(d). Any decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Stockholder Agent in connection with this Section 1.6(d) shall constitute
a decision of all the Company stockholders and optionholders and shall be
final,    -7-  15  binding and conclusive upon each of such stockholders
and optionholders and Broadcom (and/or its nominee) in its capacity as holder
of the Option Escrows may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Agent as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of every such holder. Broadcom and any such nominee are hereby
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by it in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Agent. The actions of Broadcom (and/or its nominee) with respect to, and in
its capacity as holder of, the Option Escrows shall be entitled to the
protection set forth (or equivalent to those set forth) in Section
7.2(l).   1.7 Reservation of Shares. Broadcom will reserve sufficient shares
of Broadcom Common Stock for issuance pursuant to Section 1.6.   1.8
Adjustments to Exchange Ratios. The Exchange Ratio and the Earn-Out Exchange
Ratio shall be equitably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock
split, reverse split, stock combination, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Broadcom Common
Stock or Company Capital Stock), reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Broadcom Common Stock
or Company Capital Stock the effective date of which occurs after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   1.9 Fractional Shares. No
fraction of a share of Broadcom Common Stock will be issued in the Merger,
but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Broadcom Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be
received by such holder) shall be entitled to receive from Broadcom an amount
of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (a) such
fraction, multiplied by (b) the Closing Price.   1.10 Dissenting Shares.  
(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has demanded and
perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with Delaware Law or
the California Code, as applicable, and who, as of the Effective Time,
has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters\'
rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right
to receive Broadcom Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, but the holder
thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the Delaware
Law or the California Code, as applicable.   (b) Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 1.10(a) above, if any holder of shares of Company
Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such shares under Delaware Law or the
California Code shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the later of (i)
the Effective Time or (ii) the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s
shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to
receive Broadcom Common Stock as provided in Section 1.6, without interest
thereon, upon surrender to the Company of the certificate representing such
shares in accordance with Section 1.11.    -8-  16   (c) The Company
shall give Broadcom (i) prompt notice of its receipt of any written demands
for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments relating to the Merger served pursuant to
Delaware Law or the California Code and received by the Company and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law or the California Code. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Broadcom or as
may be required under applicable law, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Capital Stock or offer to
settle or settle any such demands.   1.11 Exchange Procedures.   (a)
Broadcom Common Stock. On the Closing Date, Broadcom shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Article 1, the aggregate
number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock then issuable in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, together with cash in an amount
sufficient to permit the payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 1.9; provided, however, that, on behalf of the
holders of Company Capital Stock, Broadcom shall deposit into an escrow
account a number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock equal to the Escrow
Amount; and provided further that, on behalf of the holders of Company
Capital Stock, Broadcom shall deposit into an escrow account a number of
shares of Broadcom Common Stock equal to the Early Earn-Out Amount. The
portion of the Escrow Amount and the Early Earn-Out Amount contributed on
behalf of each holder of Company Capital Stock shall be in proportion to the
aggregate number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6 by virtue of
ownership of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock.   (b) Exchange
Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and
in any event within ten (10) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of
a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the
"Certificates") and which shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Broadcom Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Broadcom may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Broadcom Common Stock and
cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Broadcom, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Broadcom
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 (both
with respect to the Exchange Ratio and the Earn-Out Exchange Ratio), less the
number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be deposited in the Escrow Fund
on such holder\'s behalf pursuant to Article 7, less the number of shares of
Broadcom Common Stock to be deposited in the Earn-Out Escrow on such
holder\'s behalf    -9-  17  pursuant to Section 1.14, plus the amount
of cash in lieu of fractional shares to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.9, and the Certificate so surrendered shall be
canceled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and subject to and
in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 and Section 1.14, as
applicable, Broadcom shall cause to be distributed to the Depositary Agent
(i) a certificate or certificates (in such denominations as may be requested
by the Depositary Agent) representing a number of shares of Broadcom Common
Stock equal, in the aggregate, to the Escrow Amount, and (ii) a certificate
or certificates (in such denominations as may be requested by the Depositary
Agent) representing a number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock equal, in the
aggregate, to the Early Earn-Out Amount, which certificates shall be
registered in the name of the Depositary Agent. Such shares shall
be beneficially owned by the holders on whose behalf such shares were
deposited into the Escrow Fund or the Earn-Out Escrow, as applicable, and, in
the case of the Escrow Fund, shall be available to compensate Broadcom as
provided in Article 7 and, in the case of the Early Earn-Out Amount, shall be
subject to forfeiture and cancellation if the Earn-Out Milestones are not
satisfied as provided in Section 1.14. Until surrendered, each outstanding
Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company
Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends, to evidence the
ownership of the number of full shares of Broadcom Common Stock into which
such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so converted (subject
only to, if applicable, the expiration or early termination of any waiting
period under the HSR Act which is applicable to the holder of such shares),
both with respect to the Exchange Ratio and the Earn-Out Exchange Ratio, and
cash in lieu of fractional shares.   (c) Distributions With Respect to
Unexchanged Shares of Company Capital Stock. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Broadcom Common Stock declared or made after
the Effective Time and with a record date after the Effective Time will be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Broadcom Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to
applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Broadcom Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable (but for the
provisions of this Section 1.11(c)) with respect to such whole shares of
Broadcom Common Stock.   (d) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for
shares of Broadcom Common Stock is to be issued pursuant to this Agreement in
a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will
have paid to Broadcom or any agent designated by it any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of
Broadcom Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Broadcom
or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.    -10-  18   1.12 No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Capital Stock. All shares of Broadcom Common Stock issued upon the surrender
for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
1.   1.13 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event
any certificates evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue certificates
representing such shares of Broadcom Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof; provided, however, that Broadcom or the Exchange Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to provide an indemnity
or deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Broadcom or the Exchange Agent
with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   1.14 Earn-Out.   (a) Earn-Outs; Earn-Out Milestones. Schedule
1.14 sets forth the four (4) components of the Earn-Out Amount (each an
"Earn-Out" and collectively, the "Earn-Outs"), and the applicable milestone
contingencies (each, an "Earn-Out Milestone" and collectively the "Earn-Out
Milestones") that must be satisfied by the applicable Earn-Out Date in order
for such contingencies to be removed and the shares of Broadcom Common Stock
that relate to such Earn-Out to be (i) released to the stockholders of the
Company from the Earn-Out Escrow or the Option Escrows, as applicable, or
(ii) issued directly to the holder of a Company Option that is exercised
after such Earn-Out Milestone is satisfied. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Early Earn-Out Amount, without any act of any
stockholder, will be deposited with the Depositary Agent (plus a
proportionate share of any additional shares of Broadcom Common Stock as may
be issued upon any stock splits, stock dividends or recapitalizations
effected by Broadcom following the Effective Time), such deposit to
constitute the "Earn-Out Escrow" to be governed by the terms set forth
herein. The portion of the Early Earn-Out Amount contributed into the Earn-
Out Escrow on behalf of each stockholder of the Company shall be
in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock
which such holder would otherwise be entitled under Section 1.6 as a result
of the Earn-Out Exchange Ratio. Except as set forth in Schedule 1.14, no
Earn-Out is subject to increase to make up for any reduction or forfeiture of
any other Earn-Out. If an Earn-Out is satisfied by the applicable Earn-Out
Date, an appropriate portion (based on the portion of the Earn-Out Amount
that such Earn-Out represents) of the shares of Broadcom Common Stock (x)
deposited into the Earn-Out Escrow and the Option Escrows shall be
distributed out of the Earn-Out Escrow and the Option Escrows, as applicable,
in accordance with Section 1.14(g) and Section 1.6(d)(iv) and (y) to be
issued upon the exercise of a Company Option after such Earn-Out
Milestone    -11-  19  is satisfied shall be issued directly to the
holder of such Company Option upon such exercise rather than being deposited
into an Option Escrow.   (i) Any New Shares in respect of Broadcom Common
Stock in the Earn-Out Escrow which have not been released from the Earn-Out
Escrow shall be added to the Earn-Out Escrow. New Shares issued in respect of
shares of Broadcom Common Stock which have been released from the Earn-Out
Escrow shall not be added to the Earn-Out Escrow but shall be distributed to
the record holders thereof. Cash dividends on Broadcom Common Stock shall not
be added to the Earn-Out Escrow but shall be distributed to the record
holders of the Broadcom Common Stock on the record date set for any such
dividend.   (ii) Each stockholder shall have voting rights with respect to
the shares of Broadcom Common Stock contributed to the Earn-Out Escrow
by such stockholder (and on any voting securities added to the Earn-Out
Escrow in respect of such shares of Broadcom Common Stock).   (b)
Illustrative Examples. The provisions of this Agreement relating to the Earn-
Outs shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the
examples set forth in Schedule 1.14.   (c) Procedure.   (i) No later than
ten (10) Business Days following each Earn-Out Date, Broadcom shall provide
to the Stockholder Agent either (i) a statement that the relevant Earn-Out
Milestone set forth in Schedule 1.14 has been satisfied (in whole or in part)
and, if relevant to such determination, appropriate supporting documentation
regarding such Earn-Out Milestone or (ii) a statement that the relevant Earn-
Out Milestone set forth in Schedule 1.14 has not been satisfied and, if
relevant to such determination, appropriate supporting documentation
regarding such Earn-Out Milestone (each, in case of either clause (i) or
(ii), an "Earn-Out Determination"). If the Earn-Out Determination indicates
that the applicable Earn-Out Milestone has been satisfied in full and that
the applicable Earn-Out Share Number pursuant to such Earn-Out Milestone will
be released from the Earn-Out Escrow, or released from an Option Escrow to
Persons who received Broadcom Common Stock upon the exercise after the
Effective Time and prior to the satisfaction of an Earn-Out Milestone of
Company Options that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time or, in the case of Company Options which have not been exercised as of
such time, reserved for issuance, then no action on the part of the
Stockholder Agent shall be necessary and such Earn-Out Determination shall be
deemed final (a "Final Earn-Out Amount"). In any other case, the Stockholder
Agent will notify Broadcom in writing within five (5) Business Days of
receipt of such Earn-Out Determination whether the Stockholder Agent disputes
any such determination, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the
dispute (each an "Earn-Out Dispute Notice"). If the Stockholder Agent does
not deliver an Earn-Out Dispute Notice within five (5) Business Days of
receipt of an Earn-Out Determination or if the Stockholder Agent accepts such
amount in writing, such Earn-Out Determination shall be deemed a Final Earn-
Out Amount. In the event an Earn-Out Dispute Notice is delivered, Broadcom
and the Stockholder Agent shall meet within ten (10) Business Days of the
delivery of such Earn-Out Dispute Notice to attempt to resolve such dispute
in good    -12-  20  faith. If a final resolution of such dispute is
reached, the agreed upon amount shall be deemed to be the Final Earn-Out
Amount. If no final resolution is determined within fifteen (15) Business
Days of the delivery of such Earn-Out Dispute Notice after good faith
negotiation, the final determination of a Final Earn-Out Amount shall be
submitted first, to non-binding mediation in accordance with the Commercial
Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association and utilizing a
mediator acceptable to both parties, and, if no final resolution of such
dispute is reached within thirty (30) days of appointment of the mediator, or
if the parties cannot agree on a mediator within thirty (30) days, then
to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
7.2(g)(ii) and (iii). The determination of the arbitrators shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each Company Stockholder, each holder of Company
Options or Company Stock Purchase Rights, the Stockholder Agent and
Broadcom.   (ii) The Stockholder Agent may notify Broadcom in writing at
any time that he believes an Earn-Out Milestone has been satisfied.
Broadcom will cooperate in good faith with the Stockholder Agent to determine
whether such Earn-Out Milestone has been satisfied at such time.   (d)
Stockholder Agent; Depositary Agent. The provisions of Sections 7.2(h), (i)
and (k) shall apply to any acts taken by the Stockholder Agent pursuant to
this Section 1.14. Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Agent in connection with this Section 1.14 shall constitute
a decision of all the Company stockholders and optionholders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon each of such stockholders and
optionholders and the Depositary Agent and Broadcom may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of every such holder. The Depositary
Agent and Broadcom are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for
any acts done by it in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Agent. The actions of the Depositary Agent
with respect to the Earn-Out Escrow shall be entitled to the protection set
forth (or equivalent to those set forth) in Section 7.2(l).   (e) Company
Warrants. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the
contrary, the holders of Company Warrants shall not have any right to receive
any shares of Broadcom Common Stock on account of the Earn-Out Exchange
Ratio, whether from the Earn-Out Escrow, the Option Escrows, any
shares reserved for issuance in connection with the Earn-Outs or
otherwise.   (f) No Assignment of Earn-Out Rights. No interest in any Earn-
Out or any portion thereof, no right to participate, in whole or in part, in
any Earn-Out pursuant to Section 1.14, and no right to receive any
distribution of cash or securities in connection therewith pursuant to
Section 1.11 or this Section 1.14 (from the Earn-Out Escrow, an Option Escrow
or otherwise) may be assigned or transferred to any Person (whether by
operation of law, or in connection with any sale, assignment or other
transfer of any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Options or any
Broadcom securities issued in exchange therefor pursuant to Section 1.6, or
otherwise), and any attempt to do so will be null and void. The Earn-Outs and
the provisions of Section 1.11 and Section 1.14 relating to such Earn-Outs
are intended solely for the benefit of the Persons who immediately prior to
the Effective Time were holders of Company Common Stock or Company Options.
The    -13-  21  right (if any) to receive distributions in connection
with any Earn-Out shall be personal to the Persons who immediately prior to
the Effective Time were holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options,
and such right shall not (x) attach to or run with such stock or options or
any Broadcom securities issued in exchange therefor or (y) inure to the
benefit of any purchaser, assignee or other transferee either of such stock
or options or such Broadcom securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
interest in an Earn-Out (including in the Earn-Out Escrow or an Option
Escrow) may be assigned or transferred involuntarily pursuant to will or the
laws of intestate succession or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations
order as defined by the Internal Revenue Code.   (g) Release of Earn-Out
Escrow. Promptly following the final determination of the amount (if any) of
an Earn-Out, the Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was the
holder of a Certificate shall be entitled to receive from the Earn-Out Escrow
the number of whole shares of Broadcom Common Stock (if any) to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 1.14. Each stockholder of the
Company who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Broadcom
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Broadcom Common
Stock to be received by such holder) on any Earn-Out Date shall be entitled
to receive from Broadcom an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the product of (a) such fraction, multiplied by (b)
the Closing Price. If it is finally determined that any portion of an Earn-
Out has not been earned and cannot be earned as set forth in Schedule 1.14,
then the appropriate portion of the shares of Broadcom Common Stock in the
Earn-Out Escrow shall be forfeited and shall be released and returned for
cancellation to Broadcom from the Earn-Out Escrow.   1.15 Exemption From
Registration; California Permit. Broadcom and the Company intend that the
shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 in
connection with the Merger will be issued in a transaction exempt from
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder (the "Securities Act"),
by reason of Section 3(a)(10) thereof. Subject to the provisions of Section
5.1(c), Broadcom and the Company intend that the shares of Broadcom Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 in connection with the Merger will
be qualified under the California Code, pursuant to Section 25121 thereof,
after a fairness hearing has been held pursuant to the authority granted by
Section 25142 of such law (the "Fairness Hearing"), and such Fairness Hearing
shall also address the assumption by Broadcom of all Company Options, Company
Warrants and Company Stock Purchase Rights pursuant to Section 1.6 hereof.
Each of Broadcom and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(i) to file promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
an application for issuance of a permit pursuant to Section 25121 of the
California Code to issue such securities and to assume such Company Options,
Company Warrants and Company Stock Purchase Rights required by this Agreement
to be assumed by Broadcom (the "California Permit") and (ii) to obtain the
California Permit as promptly as practicable thereafter.   1.16 Taking of
Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company, or to effect the assignment to the Surviving
Corporation of any and all Company Intellectual Property    -14- 
22  created by a founder, employee or consultant of the Company
(including Intellectual Property created by any of the Company\'s founders
prior to the creation of the Company and which is necessary for the conduct
of the business of the Company as currently conducted or proposed to be
conducted in the Operating Plan), or to complete and prosecute all domestic
and foreign patent filings related to such Company Intellectual Property, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized to
take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.   ARTICLE 2

advisability. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party and the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the

been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action by the board of
directors of the Company, and no other action on the part of the board of
directors of the Company is required to authorize the execution, delivery and

applicable, duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof (and, in the
case of the Ancillary Agreements to which Broadcom is a party, thereof) by
Broadcom, each constitutes or will constitute, as applicable, a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its respective terms, except as the enforceability thereof
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to the enforcement

any statement or indication in this Agreement to the contrary, there are no
Plans (A) as to which Broadcom will be required to make any contributions or
with respect to which Broadcom shall have any obligation or liability
whatsoever, whether on behalf of any of the current employees of the Company
or any Subsidiary or on behalf of any other person, after the Closing, or (B)
which Broadcom, the Surviving Corporation will not be able to terminate
immediately after the Closing in accordance with their terms and ERISA. With
respect to each of such Plans, at the Closing there will be no unrecorded
liabilities with respect to the establishment, implementation, operation,
administration or termination of any such Plan, or the termination of the
participation in any such Plan by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates.
The Company has delivered to Broadcom true and complete copies of: (I) each
of the Plans and any related funding agreements thereto (including insurance
contracts) including all amendments, all of which are legally valid and
binding and in full force and effect and there are no defaults
thereunder, (II) the currently effective Summary Plan Description pertaining
to each of the Plans, (III) all annual reports for each of the Plans
(including all related schedules), (IV) the most recently filed PBGC Form 1
(if applicable), (V) the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination
letter, opinion, notification or advisory letter (as the case may be) for
each Plan which is intended to constitute a qualified plan under Section 401
of the Internal Revenue Code and each amendment to each of the foregoing
documents, and (VI) for each unfunded Plan, financial statements consisting
of (a) the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities of such Plan as
of its most recent valuation date, and (b) the statement of changes in fund
balance and in financial position or the statement of changes in net assets
available for benefits under such Plan for the most recently-ended plan year,
which such financial statements shall fairly present the financial condition
and the results of operations of such Plan in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied, as of such dates.   (b) Present Value of Benefits. The
present value of all accrued benefits under any Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA shall not, as of the Closing Date, exceed the value of the assets of
such Plans allocated to such accrued benefits, based upon the applicable
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA, and each such Plan shall
be capable of being terminated as of the Closing Date in a "standard
termination" under Section 4041(b) of ERISA. With respect to each Plan that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA, (i) no amount is due or owing from the
Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates to the PBGC or to any "multi-employer
Plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA on account of any withdrawal
therefrom and (ii) no such Plan has been terminated other than in accordance
with ERISA or at a time when the Plan was not sufficiently funded. The
transactions    -27-  35  contemplated hereunder, including the
termination of any Plan at or prior to the Closing, shall not result in any
such withdrawal or other liability under any applicable Laws.   (c)
Penalties; Reportable Events. Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates is subject to any material liability, tax or penalty whatsoever to
any person or agency whomsoever as a result of engaging in a prohibited
transaction under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code, and neither the Company
nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any knowledge of any circumstances which
reasonably might result in any material liability, tax or penalty, including
a penalty under Section 502 of ERISA, as a result of a breach of any duty
under ERISA or under other Laws. Each Plan which is required to comply
with the provisions of Sections 4980B and 4980C of the Internal Revenue Code,
or with the requirements referred to in Section 4980D of the Internal Revenue
Code, has complied in all material respects. No event has occurred which
could subject any Plan to tax under Section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code.
None of the Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA has, since September 2, 1974,
been completely or partially terminated nor has there been any "reportable
event", as such term is defined in Section 4043(b) of ERISA, with respect to
any of the Plans since the effective date of ERISA nor has any notice of
intent to terminate been filed or given with respect to any such Plan. There
has been no (i) withdrawal by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates that
is a substantial employer from a single-employer plan which is a Plan and
which has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not
under common control, as referred to in Section 4063(b) of ERISA, or (ii)
cessation by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates of operations at a
facility causing more than twenty percent (20%) of Plan participants to be
separated from employment, as referred to in Section 4062(f) of ERISA.
Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates, nor any other
organization of which any of them are a successor or Broadcom corporation as
defined in Section 4069(b) of ERISA, have engaged in any
transaction described in Section 4069(a) of ERISA.   (d) Deficiencies;
Qualification. None of the Plans nor any trust created thereunder has
incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" as such term is defined in
Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code, whether or not waived, since the
effective date of said Section 412, and no condition has occurred or exists
which by the passage of time could be expected to result in an accumulated
funding deficiency as of the last day of the current plan year of any such
Plan. Furthermore, neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
any unfunded liability under ERISA in respect of any of the Plans. Each
of the Plans which is intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code has received a favorable determination letter,
opinion, notification or advisory letter from the Internal Revenue Service,
and has been operated in accordance with its terms and with the provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code. All of the Plans have been administered and
maintained in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code
and all other applicable Laws. All contributions required to be made to each
of the Plans under the terms of that Plan, ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code
or any other applicable Laws have been timely made. Each Plan intended to
meet the requirements for tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter
1 of the Internal Revenue Code is in compliance with such requirements. There
are no Liens against the property of the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates under Section 412(n) of the Internal Revenue Code    -28- 
36  or Sections 302(f) or 4068 of ERISA. The Interim Financial Statements
properly reflect all amounts required to be accrued as liabilities to date
under each of the Plans.   (e) Acceleration. Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional
or further acts or events) will (i) result in any obligation or liability
(with respect to accrued benefits or otherwise) on the part of the Company,
Broadcom, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to the PBGC, to any Plan, or to any present or former employee, director,
officer, stockholder, contractor or consultant (or any of their dependents)
of the Company, Broadcom, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of their dependents, (ii) be a trigger event
under any Plan that will result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise) becoming due to any such present or former employee, officer,
director, stockholder, contractor, or consultant, or any of their dependents,
or (iii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount,
of any compensation theretofore or thereafter due or granted to any employee,
officer, director, stockholder, contractor, or consultant of the Company or
any of their dependents. With respect to any insurance policy which provides,
or has provided, funding for benefits under any Plan, (A) there is and will
be no liability of the Company, Broadcom, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in the nature of a retroactive or retrospective
rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement, or actual or contingent liability
as of the Closing Date, nor would there be any such liability if such
insurance policy were terminated as of the Closing Date, and (B) no insurance
company issuing any such policy is in receivership, conservatorship,
bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no such proceedings with respect to any insurer are imminent.  
(f) COBRA. With respect to each Plan which provides health care coverage, the
Company and each ERISA Affiliate have complied in all material respects with
(i) the applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"),
and the applicable COBRA regulations and (ii) the applicable requirements of
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the
regulations thereunder, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred any liability under Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code.  
(g) Litigation. Other than routine claims for benefits under the Plans, there
are no pending, or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened, Actions
or Proceedings involving the Plans, or the fiduciaries, administrators, or
trustees of any of the Plans or the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates as the employer or sponsor under any Plan, with
any of the IRS, the Department of Labor, the PBGC, any participant in or
beneficiary of any Plan or any other person whomsoever. The Company knows
of no reasonable basis for any such claim, lawsuit, dispute or Action
or Proceeding.   2.15 Real Property.   (a) Section 2.15(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a true and correct list of (i) each parcel of
real property leased, utilized and/or operated by the    -29- 
37  Company (as lessor or lessee or otherwise) (the "Leased Real Property")
and (ii) all Liens relating to or affecting any parcel of real property
referred to in clause (i) to which the Company is a party. The Company owns
no real property other than Company owned leasehold improvements, if any, on
the Leased Real Property.   (b) Subject to the terms of its respective
leases, the Company has a valid and subsisting leasehold estate in and the
right to quiet enjoyment of each of the Leased Real Properties for the full
term of the leases (including renewal periods) relating thereto. Each lease
referred to in clause (i) of Section 2.15(a) above is a legal, valid and
binding agreement, enforceable in accordance with its terms, of the Company
and of each other Person that is a party thereto, and except as set forth in
Section 2.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no, and the
Company has not received notice of any, default (or any condition or event
which, after notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)
thereunder. The Company does not owe brokerage commissions or finders fees
with respect to any such Leased Real Property, except to the extent that the
Company may renew the term of any such lease, in which case, any such
commissions and fees would be in amounts that are reasonable and customary
for the spaces so leased, given their intended use and terms.   (c) Except
as disclosed in Section 2.15(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all
improvements on the Leased Real Property (A) comply with and are operated in
accordance with applicable laws (including Environmental Laws) and all
applicable Liens, Approvals, Contracts, covenants and restrictions and (B)
are in all material respects in good operating condition and in a state of
good maintenance and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and such
improvements are in all material respects adequate and suitable for the
purposes for which they are presently being used and there are no
condemnation or appropriation proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against any of such real property or the
improvements thereon.   (d) True and correct copies of the documents under
which the Leased Real Property is leased, subleased (to or by the Company or
otherwise), utilized, and/or operated (the "Lease Documents") have been
delivered to Broadcom. The Lease Documents are unmodified and in full force
and effect, and there are no other Contracts between the Company and any
third party(ies), or by and among any third party(ies), claiming an interest
in the interest of the Company in the Leased Real Property or otherwise
relating to the use and occupancy of the Leased Real Property.   2.16

marketable title to, or has valid leasehold interests in or valid rights

its business, including all tangible personal property reflected on
the Company Financials and tangible personal property acquired since the
Audited Financial Statement Date, other than property disposed of since such
date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Except
as disclosed in Section 2.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all such
tangible personal property (including plant, property and equipment) is free
and clear of all Liens and is adequate and suitable in all material respects
for the conduct by the Company of its business as presently conducted, and is
in good working order and condition in all material respects,    -30- 
38  ordinary wear and tear excepted, and its use complies in all material
respects with all applicable Laws.   2.17 Intellectual Property.   (a)
Section 2.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Company
Registered Intellectual Property (including all trademarks and service marks
that the Company has used with the intent of creating or benefiting from any
common law rights relating to such marks) and lists any proceedings
or actions pending as of the date hereof before any court or tribunal
(including the PTO or equivalent authority anywhere in the world) related to
any of the Company Registered Intellectual Property.   (b) The Company has
all requisite right, title and interest in or valid and enforceable rights
under Contracts or Licenses to use all Company Intellectual Property
necessary to the conduct of its business as presently conducted. Each item of
Company Intellectual Property, including all Company Registered Intellectual
Property listed in Section 2.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, is
owned exclusively by the Company (excluding Intellectual Property licensed to
the Company under any License) and is free and clear of any Liens. The
Company (i) owns exclusively all trademarks, service marks and trade names
used by the Company in connection with the operation or conduct of
the business of the Company, including the sale of any products or technology
or the provision of any services by the Company; provided, however, that the
Company may use trademarks, service marks and trade names of third parties
which are licensed to the Company or are in the public domain, and (ii) owns
exclusively, and has good title to, each copyrighted work that is a Company

has a written agreement with such Person with respect thereto and the Company
has either (i) obtained ownership of, and is the exclusive owner of, all
such Intellectual Property by operation of law or by valid assignment of any
such rights or (ii) has obtained a License under or to such Intellectual
Property. None of the Company Intellectual Property is subject to any source
code escrow or similar arrangement.   (d) Except pursuant to agreements
described in Section 2.17(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
has not transferred ownership of or granted any License of or other right to
use or authorized the retention of any rights to use any Intellectual
Property that is or was Company Intellectual Property, to any other
Person.   (e) The Company Intellectual Property constitutes all
the Intellectual Property used in and/or necessary to the conduct of the
Company\'s business as currently conducted or as proposed to be conducted in
the Operating Plan, including the design, development, distribution,
marketing, manufacture, use, import, license, and sale of the products,

misappropriation by the Company or such other Person of the Intellectual
Property of any Person other than the Company.   (h) The operation of the
business of the Company as currently conducted or as proposed to be conducted
in the Operating Plan, including the Company\'s design, development, use,
import, manufacture and sale of the products, technology or services
(including products, technology or services currently under development) of
the Company does not (i) infringe or misappropriate the Intellectual Property
of any Person, (ii) violate any term or provision of any License or Contract
concerning such Intellectual Property (including any provision required by or
imposed pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Sections 200-212 in any License or Contract to
which the Company is a party requiring that products be manufactured
substantially in the United States ("Made-in-America Requirements")), (iii)
violate the rights of any Person (including rights to privacy or publicity),
or (iv) constitute unfair competition or an unfair trade practice under any
Law, and the Company has not received notice from any Person claiming that
such operation or any act, product, technology or service (including
products, technology or services currently under development) of the Company
infringes or misappropriates the Intellectual Property of any Person or
constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under any Law, including
notice of third party patent or other Intellectual Property rights from a
potential licensor of such rights.   (i) Each item of Company Registered
Intellectual Property is valid and subsisting, and all necessary
registration, maintenance, renewal fees, annuity fees and taxes in connection
with such Registered Intellectual Property have been paid and all necessary
documents and certificates in connection with such Company Registered
Intellectual Property have been filed with the relevant patent, copyright,
trademark or other authorities in the United States or foreign jurisdictions,
as the case may be, for the purposes of maintaining such Registered
Intellectual Property. Section 2.17(i)(1) of the Company Disclosure Schedule

from the date hereof, including the payment of any registration, maintenance,
renewal fees, annuity fees and taxes or the filing of any documents,

as set forth in Section 2.17(i)(2) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company has registered the copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office for the
latest version of each product or technology of the Company that constitutes
or includes a copyrightable work. In each case in which the Company has
acquired ownership of any    -32-  40  Intellectual Property rights from
any Person, the Company has obtained a valid and enforceable assignment
sufficient to irrevocably transfer all rights in such Intellectual Property
(including the right to seek past and future damages with respect to such
Intellectual Property) to the Company and, to the maximum extent provided for
by and required to protect the Company\'s ownership rights in and to such
Intellectual Property in accordance with applicable Laws, the Company
has recorded each such assignment of Registered Intellectual Property with
the relevant Governmental or Regulatory Authority, including the PTO, and the
U.S. Copyright Office, as the case may be.   (j) There are no Contracts or
Licenses between the Company and any other Person with respect to Company
Intellectual Property under which there is any dispute (or, to the Company\'s
knowledge, facts that may reasonably lead to a dispute) known to the Company
regarding the scope of such Contract or License, or performance under such
Contract or License, including with respect to any payments to be made or
received by the Company thereunder.   (k) To the knowledge of the Company,
no Person is infringing or misappropriating any Company Intellectual
Property.   (l) The Company has taken all commercially reasonable steps
to protect the Company\'s rights in confidential information and trade
secrets of the Company or provided by any other Person to the Company subject
to a duty of confidentiality. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) the Company has, and enforces, a policy requiring each
employee and each consultant and independent contractor with access to
confidential information to execute proprietary information, confidentiality
and invention and copyright assignment agreements substantially in the form
set forth in Section 2.17(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and all
current and former employees, consultants and independent contractors of the
Company have executed such an agreement and copies of all such agreements
have been provided to Broadcom or made available to Broadcom for review, and
(ii) none of the agreements to which the Company is a party substantially in
the form of the "Confidentiality Agreement" attached as Exhibit 2.17(l)(i) to
the Company Disclosure Schedule supersedes, amends or otherwise modifies any
other agreement that (a) is more comprehensive with respect to the terms
dealing with the Company\'s disclosure of any confidential information and/or
trade secrets to any third party and/or (b) is more restrictive on a third-
party\'s use or disclosure of such information and/or trade secrets.   (m)
No Company Intellectual Property or product, technology or service of the
Company is subject to any Order, Action or Proceeding or "march in" rights
that restricts, or that is reasonably expected to restrict in any manner, the
use, transfer or licensing of any Company Intellectual Property by the
Company or that may affect the validity, use or enforceability of
such Company Intellectual Property.   (n) No (i) product, technology,
service or publication of the Company, (ii) material published or distributed
by the Company or (iii) conduct or statement of Company constitutes obscene
material, a defamatory statement or material, false advertising or otherwise
violates any Law.    -33-  41   (o) The Company has taken all actions
necessary and appropriate to assure that there shall be no material adverse
change to its business or electronic systems or material interruptions in the
delivery of the Company\'s products and services by reason of the advent of
the year 2000, including that all of its products (including products
currently under development) will, without interruption or manual
intervention, continue to consistently, predictably and accurately record,
store, process, calculate and present calendar dates falling on and after
(and if applicable, spans of time including) January 1, 2000, and will
consistently, predictably and accurately calculate any information dependent
on or relating to such dates in the same manner, and with the same
functionality, data integrity and performance, as such products
record, store, process, calculate and present calendar dates on or before
December 31, 1999, or calculate any information dependent on or relating to
such dates. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Company
has taken all actions necessary and appropriate to ensure that the IT systems
and non-IT systems used by the Company in its internal operations will
function properly beyond 1999 (and the Company has no knowledge of any
material issues that have arisen in connection therewith) and (ii) the
Company has made inquiries of the suppliers listed in Section 2.23(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule as to the status of their Year 2000 efforts and
as a result thereof has not uncovered any problems that could materially
disrupt or harm the day-to-day functioning of business and operations of the
Company.   (p) Neither this Agreement nor any transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will result in Broadcom\'s granting any rights or licenses
with respect to the Intellectual Property of Broadcom to any Person pursuant
to any Contract to which the Company is a party or by which any of its Assets
and Properties are bound.   (q) Section 2.17(q) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of (x) all software which the Company has licensed
from any third party which is used by the Company in its products or
otherwise in its business (other than standard off-the-shelf software) and
(y) a list of all "freeware" and "shareware" incorporated into any product
now or heretofore shipped by the Company. The Company has all rights
necessary to the use of such software, "freeware" and "shareware".   (r)
The Company\'s products comply in all material respects with all applicable
standards and with the feature specifications and performance standards set
forth in the Company\'s product data sheets. There are no outstanding claims
(or facts that may reasonably lead to a claim) for breach of warranties by
the Company in connection with the foregoing. All product performance
comparisons heretofore furnished by the Company to customers or Broadcom are
accurate in all material respects as of the dates so furnished (except that,
in the case of product performance comparisons made as of a specified earlier
date, such comparisons shall be accurate as of such specified earlier date,
and, in the case of product performance comparisons superseded by a
subsequent product performance comparison furnished to the customer before
the customer\'s acquisition of a license on the product covered by the
superseded comparison, the superseding comparison shall be accurate in all
material respects and the superseded comparison shall be disregarded).  
(s) The Company has taken all reasonably necessary and appropriate steps to
protect and preserve ownership of Company Intellectual Property. The Company
has secured valid written assignments from all founders, consultants
and employees who    -34-  42  contributed to the creation or
development of the Company Intellectual Property. None of such agreements or
assignments contains exceptions pursuant to which any founder, employee or
consultant claims an interest in any Company Intellectual Property. In the
event that the consultant is concurrently employed by the Company and a third
party, the Company has taken additional steps to ensure that any Company
Intellectual Property developed by such a consultant does not belong to the
third party or conflict with the third party\'s employment agreement,
such steps include ensuring that all research and development work performed
by such a consultant are performed only on the Company\'s facilities and only
using the Company\'s resources, except as set forth in Section 2.17(s) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.   2.18 Contracts.   (a) Section 2.18(a)(1)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of each
of the Contracts (true and complete copies or, if none, reasonably complete
and accurate written descriptions of which, together with all amendments and
supplements thereto and all waivers of any terms thereof, have been provided
to Broadcom prior to the execution of this Agreement), to which the Company
is a party or by which any of its Assets and Properties is bound (other than
employee offer letters). Section 2.18(a)(2) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a true and complete list of each Contract of the Company
(i) not terminable by the Company upon thirty (30) days (or less) notice by
the Company without penalty or obligation to make payments based on such
termination or (ii) which provides for continuing design or other services
(including engineering and research and development services) by
the Surviving Corporation after the Closing Date.   (b) Each Contract
required to be disclosed in Section 2.18(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding agreement, enforceable in accordance with its terms, and to the
knowledge of the Company, each other party thereto; and except as disclosed
in Section 2.18(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of
the Company, no other party to such Contract is, nor has received notice that
it is, in violation or breach of or default under any such Contract in any
material respect (or with notice or lapse of time or both, would be in such
violation or breach of or default under any such Contract).   (c) Except as
disclosed in Section 2.18(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
is not a party to or bound by any Contract that has been or could reasonably
be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate with any other similar
Contracts, materially adverse to the Business or Condition of the Company or
that has been or could reasonably be expected to result, individually or in
the aggregate with any such other Contracts in Losses to the Company or be
materially adverse to the Business or Condition of the Company.   (d)
Except as disclosed in Section 2.18(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company is not a party to or bound by any Contract that (i) automatically
terminates or allows termination by the other party thereto upon consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) contains any
covenant or other provision    -35-  43  which limits the Company\'s
ability to compete with any Person in any line of business or in any area or
territory.   2.19 Insurance.   (a) Section 2.19(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list (including the names
and addresses of the insurers, the expiration dates thereof, the annual
premiums and payment terms thereof, the period of time covered thereby and a
brief description of the interests insured thereby) of all liability,
property, workers\' compensation, directors\' and officers\' liability and
other insurance policies currently in effect that insure any of the business,
operations or employees of the Company or affect or relate to the ownership,
use or operation of any of the Assets and Properties of the Company and that
(a) have been issued to the Company or (b) to the knowledge of the Company,
have been issued to any Person (other than the Company) for the benefit of
the Company. The insurance coverage provided by the policies set forth in
Section 2.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule will not terminate or
lapse by reason of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any of the Ancillary Agreements. Each policy listed in Section 2.19(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule is valid and binding and in full force and
effect, all premiums due thereunder have been paid when due and neither the
Company or the Person to whom such policy has been issued has received any
notice of cancellation or termination in respect of any such policy or is in
default thereunder, and the Company has no knowledge of any reason or state
of facts that could reasonably be expected to lead to the cancellation of
such policies or of any threatened termination of, or material premium
increase with respect to, any of such policies. The insurance policies listed
in Section 2.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) in light of the
business, operations and Assets and Properties of the Company are in amounts
and have coverages that are reasonable and customary for Persons engaged in
similar businesses and operations and having similar Assets and Properties
and (ii) are in amounts and have coverages as required by any Contract to
which the Company is a party or by which any of its Assets and Properties is
bound.   (b) Section 2.19(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains
a list of all claims made under any insurance policies covering the Company
in the last two (2) years. The Company has not received notice that any
insurer under any policy listed (or required to be listed) in Section 2.19(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule is denying, disputing or questioning
liability with respect to a claim thereunder or defending under a reservation
of rights clause. The Company has, in the reasonable judgment of the Company,
in light of its business, location, operations and Assets and Properties,
maintained, at all times, without interruption, appropriate insurance, both
in scope and amount of coverages.   2.20 Affiliate Transactions.   (a)
Except as disclosed in Section 2.9(f) or Section 2.20(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (i) there are no Contracts or Liabilities between the
Company, on the one hand, and (A) any current or former officer, director,
stockholder, or to the Company\'s knowledge, any Affiliate or Associate of
the Company or (B) any Person who, to the Company\'s knowledge, is
an Associate of any such officer, director, stockholder or Affiliate, on the
other hand, (ii) the Company does not provide or cause to be provided

hereunder.   4.2 No Solicitation. Until the earlier of the Effective Time
and the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of
Section 8.1, the Company will not take (and since September 5, 2000 inclusive
has not taken), nor will the Company (and since September 5, 2000 inclusive
has not permitted) permit any of the Company\'s Representatives to (directly
or indirectly), take any of the following actions with any Person other than
Broadcom and its designees: (a) solicit, encourage, initiate, entertain,
review or encourage any proposals or offers from, or participate in or
conduct discussions with or engage in negotiations with, any Person relating
to any offer, indication of interest or proposal, oral, written or otherwise,
formal or informal (a "Competing Proposed Transaction"), with respect to any
possible Business Combination with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(whether such Subsidiaries are in existence on the date hereof or are
hereafter organized), (b) provide information not customarily disclosed
consistent with the    -49-  57  Company\'s past practices with respect
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether such Subsidiaries are in
existence on the date hereof or are hereafter organized) to any Person, other
than Broadcom, relating to (or which the Company believes or should
reasonably know would be used for the purpose of formulating an offer,
indication of interest or proposal with respect to), or otherwise assist,
cooperate with, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any such
Person with regard to, any possible Business Combination with the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company (whether such Subsidiary is in existence on
the date hereof or is hereafter organized), (c) agree to, or enter into a
Contract with any Person, other than Broadcom, providing for, or approve a
Business Combination with the Company or any Subsidiary (whether such
Subsidiary is in existence on the date hereof or is hereafter organized), (d)
make or authorize any statement, recommendation, solicitation or endorsement
in support of any possible Business Combination with the Company or any
Subsidiary (whether such Subsidiary is in existence on the date hereof or is
hereafter organized) other than by Broadcom, or (e) authorize or permit any
of the Company\'s Representatives to take any such action. The Company shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any such contacts or
negotiations with any Person relating to any such transaction or Business
Combination. It shall not be a breach of this Section 4.2 if the Company or
its Representatives receive inquiries regarding any Business Combination;
provided that the Company complies with the notice provisions of this Section
4.2 and the Company and its Representatives comply with the confidentiality
obligations of the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company and any of its
Representatives respond to such inquiries by refusing to discuss the matter
further with such third party or by indicating, consistent with their
obligations under Section 4.2 hereof and the Confidentiality Agreement, that
neither the Representative nor the Company may discuss the matter. In
addition to the foregoing, if the Company receives prior to the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement any offer, indication of interest
or proposal (formal or informal, oral, written or otherwise) relating to, or
any inquiry or contact from any Person with respect to, a Competing Proposed
Transaction, the Company shall immediately notify Broadcom thereof, such
notice to include the identity of the Person or Persons making such offer,
indication of interest or proposal, and will keep Broadcom apprised on a
current basis of the status of any such offer, indication of interest or
proposal and of any modifications to the terms thereof; provided, however,
that this provision shall not in any way be deemed to limit the obligations
of the Company and its Representatives set forth in the second preceding
sentence. Each of the Company and Broadcom acknowledge that this Section 4.2
was a significant inducement for Broadcom to enter into this Agreement and
the absence of such provision would have resulted in either (i) a material
reduction in the consideration to be paid to the stockholders of the Company
in the Merger or (ii) a failure to induce Broadcom to enter into
this Agreement.   ARTICLE 5  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   5.1 Information
Statement; Permit Application.   (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after
the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare, with the full
cooperation of Broadcom, the Information Statement for the stockholders of
the Company to approve this Agreement, the    -50-  58  California
Agreement of Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Broadcom and
the Company shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Information Statement to comply with applicable federal and state
securities laws requirements. Each of Broadcom and the Company agrees to
provide promptly to the other such information concerning its business and
financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the
providing party or its counsel, may be required or appropriate for inclusion
in the Information Statement, or in any amendments or supplements thereto,
and to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the other\'s counsel
and auditors in the preparation of the Information Statement. The Company
will promptly advise Broadcom, and Broadcom will promptly advise the Company,
in writing if at any time prior to the Effective Time either the Company or
Broadcom, as applicable, shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make
it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the Information Statement
in order to make the statements contained or incorporated by reference
therein not misleading or to comply with applicable law. The Information
Statement shall contain the unanimous recommendation of the board of
directors of the Company that the Company\'s stockholders approve the Merger
and this Agreement and the conclusion of the board of directors that the
terms and conditions of the Merger are advisable and fair and reasonable to,
and in the best interests of, the stockholders of the Company. Anything to
the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, the Company shall not include
in the Information Statement any information with respect to Broadcom or its
affiliates or associates, the form and content of which information shall not
have been approved by Broadcom prior to such inclusion.   (b) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Broadcom shall
prepare, with the cooperation of the Company, and file the Permit
Application. Broadcom and the Company shall each use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Permit Application to comply with the requirements of
applicable federal and state laws. Each of Broadcom and the Company agrees to
provide promptly to the other such information concerning its business and
financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the
providing party or its counsel, may be required or appropriate for
inclusion in the Permit Application, or in any amendments or supplements
thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the other\'s
counsel and auditors in the preparation and completion of the Permit
Application. The Company will promptly advise Broadcom, and Broadcom will
promptly advise the Company, in writing if at any time prior to the Effective
Time either the Company or Broadcom, as applicable, shall obtain knowledge of
any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement
the Permit Application in order to make the statements contained or
incorporated by reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable
law. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, Broadcom
shall not include in the Permit Application any information with respect to
the Company or its affiliates or associates, the form and content of which
information shall not have been approved by the Company prior to such
inclusion.   (c) In the event that it is determined by Broadcom,
following consultation with the Company, that the California Permit cannot be
obtained, or cannot reasonably be expected to be obtained, in time to permit
the Closing to occur on or before January 15, 2001 then Broadcom and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the issuance of
the shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section
1.6    -51-  59  in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act on terms and conditions that are reasonably satisfactory to
Broadcom and the Company. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in
such event: (i) as a condition to effecting such issuance as a private
placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, Broadcom shall be
entitled to obtain from each stockholder of the Company a Stockholder
Certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (or such other form as
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Broadcom) (the "Stockholder Certificate")
and that Broadcom will be relying upon the representations made by each
stockholder of the Company in the applicable Stockholder Certificate in
connection with the issuance of Broadcom Common Stock to such stockholder,
(ii) at the Closing, Broadcom shall execute and deliver a backup registration
rights agreement (the "Backup Registration Rights Agreement") granting Form
S-3 registration rights with respect to the shares subject to terms,
condition, limitations, blackout periods and postponement rights (as
reasonably requested by Broadcom to accommodate other potential acquisitions
and significant corporate developments) reasonably acceptable to the parties;
(iii) the shares of Broadcom Common Stock so issued pursuant to Section 1.6
will not be registered under the Securities Act and will
constitute "restricted securities" within the meaning of the Securities Act;
and (iv) the certificates representing the shares of Broadcom Common Stock
shall bear appropriate legends to identify such privately placed shares as
being restricted under the Securities Act, to comply with applicable state
securities laws and, if applicable, to notice the restrictions on transfer of
such shares.   5.2 Stockholder Approval. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall
give written notice of this Agreement and the proposed Merger to all Company
stockholders and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all other
action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws to convene a meeting of the stockholders of the
Company or to secure the written consent of its stockholders ("Company
Stockholder Action") within ten (10) days of the issuance of the California
Permit. The Company shall submit this Agreement and the Agreement of Merger
to its stockholders for adoption whether or not the Company\'s board of
directors determines at any time subsequent to declaring its advisability
that this Agreement is no longer advisable and recommends that its
stockholders reject it. The Company shall consult with Broadcom regarding the
date of the Company Stockholder Action and shall not postpone or adjourn
(other than for the absence of a quorum) any meeting of the stockholders of
the Company without the consent of Broadcom, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Company shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts required to solicit and obtain from stockholders of the
Company proxies or written consents in favor of the Merger and this Agreement
and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or
written consent of stockholders required to effect the Merger. The Company
shall establish a record date for determining the stockholders of the Company
entitled to vote or consent in connection with the Company Stockholder Action
that is as early as possible after the date of this Agreement. The materials
submitted to the stockholders of the Company in respect of the Merger shall
have been subject to prior review and comment by Broadcom and shall include
(a) information regarding the Company, the terms of the Merger and this
Agreement, (b) the unanimous recommendation of the board of directors of the
Company that the Company\'s stockholders approve the Merger and this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and approve and execute
such other documents as may be    -52-  60  required to satisfy the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act in connection with the issuance
and sale of Broadcom Common Stock in the Merger, (c) the conclusion of the
board of directors of the Company that the terms and conditions of the Merger
are advisable, fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, the
Company\'s stockholders and (d) such other documents as may be required to
satisfy the applicable requirements of the Securities Act in connection with
the issuance and sale of Broadcom Common Stock in the Merger.   5.3 Access
to Information. Between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable notice
the Company shall (a) give Broadcom and its officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financing sources and other agents and representatives reasonable
access to all buildings, offices, and other facilities and to all Books and
Records of the Company, whether located on the premises of the Company or at
another location; (b) permit Broadcom to make such inspections as it may
reasonably require; (c) cause its officers to furnish Broadcom such
financial, operating, technical and product data and other information with
respect to the business and Assets and Properties of the Company as Broadcom
from time to time may reasonably request, including financial statements and
schedules; (d) allow Broadcom the opportunity to interview such employees and
other personnel and Affiliates of the Company with the Company\'s prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
and (e) assist and cooperate with Broadcom in the development of integration
plans for implementation by Broadcom and the Surviving Corporation following
the Effective Time; provided, however, that no investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company herein. Materials furnished to Broadcom pursuant
to this Section 5.3 may be used by Broadcom for strategic and integration
planning purposes relating to accomplishing the transactions contemplated
hereby.   5.4 Confidentiality. The parties acknowledge that Broadcom and
the Company have previously executed a non-disclosure agreement
(the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Without
limiting the foregoing, all information furnished to Broadcom and its
officers, employees, accountants and counsel by the Company, and all
information furnished to the Company by Broadcom and its officers, employees,
accountants and counsel, shall be covered by the Confidentiality Agreement,
and Broadcom and the Company shall be fully liable and responsible under the
Confidentiality Agreement for any breach of the terms and conditions thereof
by their respective subsidiaries, officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other Representatives.   5.5 Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger
including all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other
fees and expenses of third parties ("Third Party Expenses") incurred by a
party in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, shall
be the obligation of the respective party incurring such fees and expenses.
Broadcom shall have the right to approve Third Party Expenses to be incurred
by the Company between the date hereof and the Closing, including fees and
expenses of legal counsel, accountants, financial advisors, auditors and tax
advisors, which such approvals will not be unreasonably withheld, and
the    -53-  61  Company shall not pay any such Third Party Expenses
that have not been so approved. The Company may pay at the Closing any Third
Party Expenses that have been approved by Broadcom, provided that the Company
provides Broadcom with detailed back-up documentation for such Third Party
Expenses at least ten days prior to the Closing and provides Broadcom with a
meaningful opportunity to discuss such documentation and expenses with the
Company and the service provider.   5.6 Public Disclosure. Unless otherwise
required by Law (including federal and state securities laws) or, as to
Broadcom, by the rules and regulations of the NASD, prior to the Effective
Time, no public disclosure (whether or not in response to any inquiry) of the
existence of any subject matter of, or the terms and conditions of, this
Agreement shall be made by any party hereto unless approved by Broadcom and
the Company prior to release; provided, however, that such approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Broadcom and the Company agree to
consult with each other as to the contents of the public disclosure prior to
its release. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Broadcom and the Company
shall be permitted to disclose the existence of this Agreement to their
customers, suppliers and sales representatives with whom they have non-
disclosure agreements that apply to such disclosure (or the other party
otherwise agrees to such disclosure) and, except as prohibited by Section
4.2, for which there is a business reason for the disclosure and (b) pursuant
to Section 4.2, the Company may, in general terms only, in response to
inquiries from third parties concerning any Competing Proposed Transaction,
respond that the Company is under a contractual obligation not to discuss
such matters.   5.7 Approvals. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all Approvals from Governmental or Regulatory Authorities
or under any of the Contracts or other agreements as may be required in
connection with the Merger (all of which Approvals are set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule) so as to preserve all rights of and benefits to
the Company thereunder and Broadcom shall provide the Company with such
assistance and information as is reasonably required to obtain such
Approvals.   5.8 FIRPTA Compliance. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Broadcom a properly executed statement in a form
reasonably acceptable to Broadcom for purposes of satisfying Broadcom\'s
obligations under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).   5.9
Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Broadcom, and Broadcom shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the
Company or Broadcom, respectively, contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing Date and (b) any failure of the
Company or Broadcom, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.9 shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available
to the party receiving such notice.   5.10 Company Affiliate Agreements.
Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth those persons who,
in the Company\'s reasonable judgment following consultation with legal
counsel and accounting advisors, are or may be "affiliates" of the   
-54-  62  Company within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act
(the "Company Affiliates"). The Company shall provide Broadcom such
information and documents as Broadcom shall reasonably request for purposes
of reviewing such list. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Broadcom on or prior to the
Closing from each of the Company Affiliates, an executed Company Affiliate
Agreement. The Company agrees that if any Person would have been a Company
Affiliate had such Person been a stockholder of the Company as of the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall cause such person to execute and deliver to
the Company a Company Affiliate Agreement promptly upon such Person attaining
such status.   5.11 Additional Documents and Further Assurances;
Cooperation. Each party hereto, at the request of the other party hereto,
shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do and perform such
other acts and things (including all action reasonably necessary to seek and
obtain any and all consents, waivers and approvals of any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority or Person required in connection with the Merger;
provided, however, that Broadcom shall not be obligated to consent to any
divestitures or operational limitations or activities in connection therewith
and no party shall be obligated to make a payment of money as a condition to
obtaining any such consent, waiver or approval) as may be necessary or
desirable for effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Article 6 to be
satisfied, where the satisfaction of such conditions depends on action or
forbearance from action by such party.   5.12 Indemnification. Broadcom, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights to
indemnification or exculpation now existing in favor of the employees,
agents, directors or officers of the Company (the "Company Indemnified
Parties") as provided in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws or
indemnification agreements as in effect on the date of this Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of four (4) years from
and after the Closing Date, assuming the consummation of the Merger;
provided, however, that, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or
made within such four (4) year period, all rights to indemnification in
respect of any such claim or claims shall continue to disposition of any and
all such claims. Any determination required to be made with respect to
whether a Company Indemnified Party\'s conduct complies with the standards
set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or indemnification
agreements of the Surviving Corporation or otherwise shall be made by
independent counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation reasonably
satisfactory to the Company Indemnified Party (whose fees and expenses shall
be paid by the Surviving Corporation), which such determination shall be
final and binding on the parties thereto. The Company hereby represents and
warrants to Broadcom that no claim for indemnification has been made by any
director or officer of the Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
basis exists for any such claim for indemnification.   5.13 Form S-8.
Broadcom shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of
Broadcom Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Options
promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within fifteen
(15) Business Days    -55-  63  thereafter) to the extent the shares of
Broadcom Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Options qualify
for registration on Form S-8.   5.14 NNM Listing of Additional Shares
Application. Prior to the Effective Time, Broadcom shall, to the extent
required by the rules of the NNM, notify the NNM of the shares of Broadcom
Common Stock to be issued, and the shares of Broadcom Common Stock required
to be reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger, to the effect
that such shares may be traded on the NNM immediately after the Effective
Time (subject to compliance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act).   5.15
Company\'s Auditors. The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its management and its independent auditors to facilitate on a timely
basis (a) the preparation of financial statements (including pro
forma financial statements if required) as required by Broadcom to comply
with applicable SEC regulations, (b) the review of any Company audit or
review work papers, including the examination of selected interim financial
statements and data and (c) the delivery of such representations from the
Company\'s independent accountants as may be reasonably requested by Broadcom
or its accountants.   5.16 Termination of 401(k) Plans. Unless Broadcom
requests otherwise in writing, the board of directors of the Company shall
adopt resolutions terminating, effective as of the day prior to the Closing
Date, any Plan which is intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(k)
of the Internal Revenue Code, and which is sponsored, or contributed to, by
the Company or any Subsidiary. At the Closing, the Company shall provide
Broadcom (a) executed resolutions of the board of directors of the Company
authorizing such termination and (b) an executed amendment to the 401(k) Plan
sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified
status of the 401(k) Plan will be maintained at the time of termination.  
5.17 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby, the board of directors of the
Company will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary
so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of any
Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated hereby.   5.18
Treatment as Reorganization. Neither Broadcom nor the Company shall take any
action prior to or following the Closing that would cause the Merger to fail
to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code.   5.19 Company Repurchases. The Company will exercise
any rights that mature between the date hereof and the Effective Time to
repurchase any outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock at the price at
which such shares were issued .   5.20 Information Technology Access. In
furtherance of the Company\'s agreement in Section 5.3 and to facilitate
prompt integration following the Closing of the Company\'s information
technology ("IT") inventory (e.g., voice and data network services and
software    -56-  64  and hardware, licenses, financial/accounting
software, IT budgets, etc.) with Broadcom\'s, the Company will provide
Broadcom and its Representatives with access to the Company\'s IT inventory,
as well as the Company\'s personnel responsible for such IT inventory.
Because of the substantial lead time that may be required to order and
install new software and hardware to integrate the Company\'s IT systems with
Broadcom\'s, and the importance of a smooth integration of such IT systems
promptly after the Closing, the Company agrees that Broadcom may order,
either in Broadcom\'s name or, if required by the vendor, the Company\'s
name, any new IT services, hardware and software that Broadcom believes will
be needed at the Company\'s facilities in order to integrate Broadcom\'s and
the Company\'s respective operations following the Closing. The Company will
cooperate with Broadcom in the installation of such IT systems, hardware and
software prior to and in anticipation of the Closing, including providing
Broadcom with reasonable access to and use of the Company\'s appropriate
personnel. If required by the vendor, at Broadcom\'s request, the Company
will place IT systems, hardware and software orders in the Company\'s name.
For clarity, it is the parties\' intent not to connect any of the
ordered services or systems prior to the Closing. Broadcom and the Company
agree to cooperate with each other to minimize any potential disruption to
the Company\'s business from the IT integration efforts; provided, however,
that Broadcom will not have any liability to the Company for any such
disruption or as may otherwise result from the IT integration efforts, except
as may be directly caused by Broadcom\'s gross negligence or willful
misconduct; and provided further that in no event will Broadcom have any
liability to the Company for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special
or speculative damages, including damages for loss of profits or use,
business interruption or loss of goodwill, irrespective of whether such
damages arise under contract, tort, statute or otherwise and whether or not
the Company has given Broadcom advance notice of the possibility of such
damages. If the Closing does not occur, other than because of the Company\'s
breach of the Merger Agreement, Broadcom will reimburse the Company for its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by it in connection
with the ordering and installation of IT services, hardware and software. If
Broadcom is so required to reimburse the Company, Broadcom will own any such
hardware and software and will pay for its removal from Company premises.
Broadcom and the Company will cooperate in the removal of any such hardware
or software so as to minimize any disruption to the Company\'s business. In
addition, if the Closing does not occur, the Company will cooperate
with Broadcom in canceling any orders for IT services, hardware or software
and will otherwise act to minimize the costs which might be incurred in
connection with the IT integration efforts.   5.21 Change of Merger Form.
The Company agrees that in the event Broadcom requests that the transactions
contemplated hereby be effected through a different form of merger (including
a reverse triangular or forward triangular merger) than the form presently
contemplated herein, and provided that the alternative form of merger is in
any event intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, and the Company
reasonably determines that it is expected to so qualify, the Company shall
cooperate with Broadcom in effecting the alternative form of merger and will
take all reasonably necessary action towards such end, including the
execution of any amendments to this Agreement (provided that such amendments
relate only to the alternative form of merger and any related matters and do
not include any other substantive changes not otherwise agreed between the
parties).    -57-  65   5.22 Intellectual Property. The Company shall
give Broadcom prompt notice that any Person shall have (a) commenced, or
shall have notified the Company in writing that it intends to commence, an
Action or Proceeding or (b) provided the Company with written notice, in
either case which allege(s) that any of the Intellectual Property, including
the Company Intellectual Property, presently embodied, or proposed to be
embodied, in the Company\'s products or utilized in any development tools
(including standard cells) or design environments designed or modified by the
Company infringes or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of
such Person, is available for licensing from a potential licensor providing
the notice or otherwise alleges that the Company does not otherwise own or
have the right to exploit such Intellectual Property, including the Company
Intellectual Property. The Company shall cooperate with Broadcom in making
arrangements, prior to the Closing Date, satisfactory to Broadcom in its sole
discretion to effect the assignment to the Company of all
Intellectual Property created by the Company\'s founders, employees and
consultants in the course of providing services to the Company, including
Intellectual Property created by the Company\'s founders prior to the
Company\'s incorporation and which is necessary for the operation of the
business of the Company as currently conducted or proposed to be conducted in
the Operating Plan, and to obtain the cooperation of such Persons to complete
all appropriate patent filings related thereto. The Company shall take
commercially reasonable actions to maintain, perfect, preserve or renew the
Company Registered Intellectual Property, including the payment of any
registration, maintenance, renewal fees, annuity fees and taxes or the filing
of any documents, applications or certificates related thereto, and to
promptly respond and prepare to respond to all requests, related to the
Company Registered Intellectual Property, received from Governmental or
Regulatory Authorities. At the Closing, the Company will notify Broadcom of
all material actions which must be taken within the ninety (90)
days following the Closing Date and which are necessary to maintain,
perfect, preserve or renew the Company Registered Intellectual Property,
including the payment of any registration, maintenance, renewal fees, annuity
fees and taxes or the filing of any documents, applications or certificates
related thereto.   5.23 Delivery of Stock Ledger and Minute Book of the
Company. The Company shall deliver its stock ledger and minute book to
Broadcom at the Closing.   5.24 Adjustment of Base Share Number and Earn-Out
Share Numbers. The parties acknowledge that the Company intends to issue
Company Options to new employees of the Company in the ordinary course of
business between the date hereof and the Closing Date. Broadcom and the
Company acknowledge that the Base Share Number and the Earn-Out Amount will
be increased in accordance with Schedule 5.24(a) as necessary to offset the
dilutive effect of grants of Company Options to newly hired Company employees
between the date hereof and the Closing to the extent that such new hires and
grants of Company Options are approved by Broadcom. The Company shall notify
Broadcom of grants of Company Options made to newly-hired employees and shall
provide Broadcom with such information as Broadcom shall request in order for
Broadcom to determine whether an increase in the Base Share Number and the
Earn-Out Amount is required in connection with such grant. The Base Share
Number and the Earn-Out Amount will be increased pursuant to this Section
5.24 only if Broadcom and the Company agree in writing to such increase. In
no event will the Closing be delayed, postponed or affected if there is a
dispute between the    -58-  66  Company and Broadcom as to whether the
Base Share Number and the Earn-Out Amount are required to be increased
pursuant to this section. If any such dispute cannot be resolved before the
Closing, such dispute will be resolved post-Closing by Broadcom and the
Stockholder Agent pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions of this
Agreement.   5.25 Certain Actions Relating to the Holders of Warrants and
Preferred Stock. The Company shall take all requisite commercially reasonable
efforts (a) to cause all Company Warrants (if any) that would otherwise be
outstanding and exercisable at or immediately prior to the Effective Time to
be exercised in full, by means of a cash exercise (and not by means of net
exercise), for shares of Company Capital Stock prior to the Effective Time
(and thereafter converted, as applicable, into shares of Company Common
Stock), and to cause the cash exercise price therefor to be paid to the
Company; and (b) to cause the holders of all outstanding Company Warrants (if
any) to execute and deliver to the Company waivers of notice with respect to
the notice that would otherwise be applicable to the Merger.   5.26
Employee Benefits. On or as soon as practicable following the Closing Date,
as determined by Broadcom, continuing employees of the Company ("Continuing
Employees") shall be eligible to participate in those benefit
plans maintained for similarly situated employees of Broadcom (or in
substantially similar programs), on substantially the same terms applicable
to similarly situated employees of Broadcom. Each Continuing Employee shall
be given credit, for purposes of any service requirements for participation
or vesting, for his or her period of service with the Company credited under
a similar plan prior to the Closing Date, subject to appropriate break in
service rules and any limitations contained in any applicable plan; provided,
however, that no such prior service credit shall apply with respect to the
vesting schedule of any options or other similar incentive awards granted by
Broadcom to the Continuing Employees. Each such employee shall, with respect
to any Broadcom plan which has co-payment, deductible or other co-insurance
features, receive credit for any amounts such individual has paid to date in
the plan year of the Closing Date under comparable plans or programs
maintained by the Company prior to the Closing Date, subject to limitations
contained in any applicable plan. Each Continuing Employee and eligible
dependent who, at the Closing Date, was participating in an employee group
health plan maintained by the Company shall not be excluded from Broadcom\'s
employee group health plan or limited in coverage thereunder by reason of any
waiting period restriction or pre-existing condition limitation, subject to

with Broadcom, each Continuing Employee shall be required to execute
Broadcom\'s standard form of employee proprietary information and inventions
agreement.   5.27 Capitalization Table. The Company shall deliver to
Broadcom prior to the Closing Date a capitalization table for the Company as

existence.   ARTICLE 7  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS
AND AGREEMENTS;  ESCROW PROVISIONS   7.1 Survival of Representations,
Warranties, Covenants and Agreements. Notwithstanding any right of Broadcom
or the Company (whether or not exercised) to investigate the affairs of
Broadcom or the Company (whether pursuant to Section 5.3 or otherwise) or a
waiver by Broadcom or the Company of any condition to Closing set forth in
Article 6, each party shall have the right to rely fully upon the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the other party
contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement. Except for (i) the covenant contained in Section 5.12 (which shall
survive for the period set forth therein) and (ii) Article 7 (which
shall survive until termination of the escrow created thereby and the
satisfaction of any other obligations described therein), all of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company and
Broadcom contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant
to this Agreement shall survive the Merger and continue until the eighteen
(18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Expiration Date").   7.2
Escrow Provisions.   (a) Establishment of the Escrow Fund. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount, without
any act of any stockholder, will be deposited with the Depositary Agent (plus
a proportionate share of any additional shares of Broadcom Common Stock as
may be issued upon any stock splits, stock dividends or    -65- 
73  recapitalizations effected by Broadcom following the Effective Time),
such deposit to constitute the "Escrow Fund" to be governed by the terms set
forth herein. The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of
each stockholder of the Company shall be in proportion to the aggregate
number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock which such holder would otherwise
be entitled under Section 1.6. Notwithstanding the references in this
Agreement to the "escrow" and the Escrow Fund, the parties acknowledge and
agree that the Depositary Agent is acting as a depositary and not as an
escrow agent pursuant to this Article 7.   (b) Recourse to the Escrow Fund.
The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate Broadcom and its officers,
directors, employees, agents, Affiliates and Associates (collectively, the
"Broadcom Indemnitees") for any and all Losses (whether or not involving a
Third Party Claim), incurred or sustained by Broadcom or any other Broadcom
Indemnitee as a result of any inaccuracy in or breach (or any claim by any
third party alleging, constituting or involving an inaccuracy or breach) of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained
herein or in the Ancillary Agreements or in any instrument delivered pursuant
to this Agreement; provided, however, that, except in the case of claims for
Losses resulting from a breach, violation or inaccuracy in or omission from
any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section
2.3 or the related sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Broadcom may
not make any claims against the Escrow Fund unless the aggregate Losses
incurred or sustained exceed two million three hundred thousand
dollars ($2,300,000) (at which such time claims may be made for all Losses
incurred or sustained). The dollar threshold set forth in the immediately
preceding proviso shall not apply to Losses resulting from any breach,
violation or inaccuracy in or omission from any of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 2.3 or the related sections of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, which shall be recoverable without respect
to any threshold amount. Broadcom and the Company each acknowledge that such
Losses, if any, would relate to unresolved contingencies existing at the
Effective Time, which if resolved at the Effective Time would have led to a
reduction in the aggregate Merger consideration to be paid to the
stockholders of the Company. The stockholders of the Company shall not have
any liability under this Agreement of any sort whatsoever in excess of the
Escrow Fund, and the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Broadcom, except in the case of either fraud or willful misconduct (i.e., an
intentional breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, but
excluding a negligent or reckless breach) by the Company of any of its
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained in this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or in any other instrument or
document required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement in connection
herewith. In the event of such a fraudulent or willful breach, Broadcom shall
have all remedies available at law or in equity (including for tort) with
respect to such breach; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, except in the event that such
stockholder induced or participated in such fraud or willful misconduct, in
no event shall any stockholder of the Company have any liability (i) in
excess of the stockholder\'s pro rata share of such liability or (ii) in
excess of the Merger consideration received by such stockholder in connection
with the Merger or the proceeds, if any, received by such stockholder in
connection with the disposition of such Merger consideration.    -66- 
74   (c) Escrow Period; Distribution of Escrow Fund upon Termination
of Escrow Period. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund
shall be in existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall
terminate at 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the Expiration Date (the period of
time from the Effective Time through and including the Expiration Date is
referred to herein as the "Escrow Period"); and all shares of Broadcom Common
Stock remaining in the Escrow Fund shall be distributed as set forth in this
Section 7.2(c); provided, however, that the Escrow Period shall not terminate
with respect to such amount (or some portion thereof) that is necessary in
the reasonable judgment of Broadcom, subject to the objection of the
Stockholder Agent and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner
as provided in Section 7.2(g), to satisfy any unsatisfied claims under this
Section 7.2 concerning facts and circumstances existing prior to the
termination of such Escrow Period which claims are specified in any
Officer\'s Certificate delivered to the Depositary Agent prior to termination
of such Escrow Period. As soon as all such unsatisfied claims, if any, have
been resolved, the Depositary Agent shall deliver to the stockholders of the
Company the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy such
unsatisfied claims. Deliveries of shares of Broadcom Common Stock remaining
in the Escrow Fund to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to this
Section 7.2(c) shall be made ratably in proportion to their respective
contributions to the Escrow Fund. Each stockholder of the Company who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Broadcom Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be
received by such holder) shall be entitled to receive from Broadcom an amount
of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (a) such
fraction, multiplied by (b) the Closing Price. Broadcom shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to have such shares and cash delivered
within five (5) Business Days after such resolution.   (d) Protection of
Escrow Fund.   (i) The Depositary Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow
Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of
Broadcom and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance
with the terms hereof.   (ii) Any shares of Broadcom Common Stock or other
Equity Equivalents issued or distributed by Broadcom ("New Shares") in
respect of Broadcom Common Stock in the Escrow Fund which have not been
released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund. New Shares
issued in respect of shares of Broadcom Common Stock which have been released
from the Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be
distributed to the record holders thereof. Cash dividends on Broadcom Common
Stock shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the
record holders of the Broadcom Common Stock on the record date set for any
such dividend.   (iii) Each stockholder shall have voting rights
with respect to the shares of Broadcom Common Stock contributed to the Escrow
Fund by such stockholder (and on any voting securities added to the Escrow
Fund in respect of such shares of Broadcom Common Stock).    -67-  75  
(e) Claims Upon Escrow Fund.   (i) Upon receipt by the Depositary Agent at
any time on or before the last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate
signed by any officer of Broadcom (an "Officer\'s Certificate"): (A) stating
that Broadcom or another Broadcom Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued or
reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue Losses, directly or
indirectly, as a result of any inaccuracy or breach (or any claim by any
third party alleging, constituting or involving an inaccuracy or breach) of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained
in this Agreement or in any of the Ancillary Agreements or in any instrument
or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so
stated, the date each such item was paid or properly accrued, or the basis
for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty, agreement or covenant to which such item is related, the
Depositary Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(f), deliver
to Broadcom out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, shares of
Broadcom Common Stock held in the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such
Losses. Where the basis for a claim upon the Escrow Fund by Broadcom is that
Broadcom reasonably anticipates that it will pay or accrue a Loss, no payment
will be made from the Escrow Fund for such Loss unless and until such Loss is
actually paid or accrued.   (ii) For the purposes of determining the number
of shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be delivered to Broadcom out of the
Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 7.2(e)(i), the shares of Broadcom Common
Stock shall be valued at the Closing Price.   (f) Objections to Claims. At
the time of delivery of any Officer\'s Certificate to the Depositary Agent, a
duplicate copy of such certificate shall be delivered to the Stockholder
Agent and the other Persons set forth in Section 9.1 hereof, and for a period
of thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Depositary Agent shall make no
delivery to Broadcom of any Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 7.2(e) unless
the Depositary Agent shall have received written authorization from the
Stockholder Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty
(30) day period, the Depositary Agent shall make delivery of shares of
Broadcom Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 7.2(e),
provided that no such payment or delivery may be made if the Stockholder
Agent shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer\'s
Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Depositary
Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period.   (g)
Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.   (i) In case the Stockholder Agent
shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer\'s
Certificate, the Stockholder Agent and Broadcom shall attempt in good faith
to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of
such claims. If the Stockholder Agent and Broadcom should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and shall be furnished to the Depositary Agent. The Depositary Agent
shall be entitled to rely    -68-  76  on any such memorandum and
distribute shares of Broadcom Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms thereof.   (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after
good faith negotiation, either Broadcom or the Stockholder Agent may demand
arbitration of the dispute unless the amount of the damage or loss is at
issue in a pending Action or Proceeding involving a Third Party Claim, in
which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either event the
matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators, one
selected by Broadcom and one selected by the Stockholder Agent, and the two
arbitrators selected by Broadcom and the Stockholder Agent shall select a
third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall set a limited time period and
establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery of
information relating to any dispute while allowing the parties an
opportunity, adequate as determined in the sole judgment of the arbitrators,
to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel,
limit or allow discovery as they shall deem appropriate given the nature and
extent of the disputed claim. The arbitrators shall also have the
authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys\' fees and other costs
incurred by the parties, to the same extent as a court of law or equity,
should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to by a
party without substantial justification. The decision of a majority of the
three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such
Officer\'s Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to
this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 7.2(f), the
Depositary Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision
and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.
Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of
fact and conclusions regarding the dispute which shall set forth the award,
judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators.   (iii) Judgment upon
any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having
competent jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in the city and
county of Los Angeles, California under the commercial rules of arbitration
then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. For purposes of this
Section 7.2(g), (i) in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the
amount thereof stated in the Officer\'s Certificate is at issue, Broadcom
shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party in the event that the
arbitrators award Broadcom less than the sum of one-half of the disputed
amount of any Losses plus any amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the
stockholders of the Company as represented by the Stockholder Agent shall
be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party and (ii) in any arbitration
hereunder in which an Earn-Out is in dispute, Broadcom shall be deemed to be
the Non-Prevailing Party in the event that the arbitrators determine that
more than the sum of one-half of the disputed amount of any Earn-Out
Determination plus any amounts not in dispute have been earned pursuant to
the disputed Earn-Out; otherwise, the stockholders of the Company, as
represented by the Stockholder Agent, shall be deemed to be the Non-
Prevailing Party. The Non-Prevailing Party to an arbitration shall pay its
own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative costs of the
arbitration and the expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
costs, incurred by the other party to the arbitration.    -69-  77   (h)
Stockholder Agent of the Stockholders; Power of Attorney.   (i) In the event
that the Merger is approved by the stockholders of the Company, effective
upon such vote, and without further act of any stockholder, Leo A. Joseph
shall be appointed as Agent and attorney-in-fact (the "Stockholder Agent")
for each stockholder of the Company (except such stockholders, if any, as
shall have perfected their appraisal or dissenters\' rights under Delaware
Law or the California Code, as applicable), for and on behalf of stockholders
of the Company, to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize
delivery to Broadcom of shares of Broadcom Common Stock from the Escrow Fund
in satisfaction of claims by Broadcom, to object to such deliveries, to agree
to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the judgment of the Stockholder Agent for the accomplishment of the
foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the stockholders of the Company from
time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to
Broadcom; provided, however, that the Stockholder Agent may not be removed
unless holders of at least a two-thirds interest in the Escrow Fund agree to
such removal and to the identity of the substituted Stockholder Agent. Any
vacancy in the position of Stockholder Agent may be filled by approval of the
holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be
required of the Stockholder Agent, and the Stockholder Agent shall
not receive compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or
from the Stockholder Agent pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof shall constitute
notice to or from each of the stockholders of the Company.   (ii) The
Stockholder Agent shall not incur any liability with respect to any action
taken or suffered by him or omitted hereunder as Shareholder Agent while
acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The
Stockholder Agent may, in all questions arising hereunder, rely on the advice
of counsel and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the
Stockholder Agent based on such advice, the Stockholder Agent shall not be
liable to anyone. The Stockholder Agent undertakes to perform such duties
and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and no
implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against
the Stockholder Agent.   (iii) The Stockholder Agent shall have reasonable
access to information about the Company and the reasonable assistance of the
Company\'s officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties and
exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the Stockholder Agent shall
treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about
the Company to anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who
agree in writing to treat such information confidentially).   (i) Actions
of the Stockholder Agent. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all the stockholders for
whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to them are deposited
in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of
such stockholders, and the Depositary Agent and Broadcom may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Agent as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of every such stockholder of
the Company. The Depositary Agent and Broadcom are hereby    -70- 
78  relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them
in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Agent. The Stockholder Agent hereby agrees to perform its
obligations and be bound by the terms and provisions of Section 1.6, Section
1.11 and Section 1.14 relating to the Stockholder Agent.   (j) Third-Party
Claims. In the event Broadcom becomes aware of a third-party claim (a "Third
Party Claim") which Broadcom reasonably expects may result in a demand
against the Escrow Fund, Broadcom shall notify the Stockholder Agent of such
claim, and the Stockholder Agent, as representative for the stockholders of
the Company, shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any
defense of such claim. Broadcom shall have the right in its sole discretion
to settle any Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if Broadcom settles
any Third Party Claim without the Stockholder Agent\'s consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Broadcom may not make a claim
against the Escrow Fund with respect to the amount of Losses incurred by
Broadcom in such settlement. In the event that the Stockholder Agent has
consented to any such settlement, the Stockholder Agent shall have no
power or authority to object under any provision of this Article 7 to the
amount of any claim by Broadcom against the Escrow Fund with respect to the
amount of Losses incurred by Broadcom in such settlement.   (k)
Indemnification for Stockholder Agent. The stockholders of the Company shall,
severally and not jointly, on a pro rata basis based on their proportionate
ownership interests in the Company, indemnify, defend and hold
the Stockholder Agent harmless from and against any loss, damage, tax,
liability and expense that may be incurred by the Stockholder Agent arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Stockholder Agent\'s duties, except as caused by the Stockholder Agent\'s
gross negligence or willful misconduct, including the legal costs and
expenses of defending such Stockholder Agent against any claim or liability
in connection with the performance of the Stockholder Agent\'s duties. The
Stockholder Agent shall be entitled, but not limited, to such indemnification
from the Escrow prior to any distribution thereof to the stockholders of the
Company, but after any distributions therefrom to Broadcom.   (l)
Depositary Agent\'s Duties.   (i) Limitation on Duties of Depositary Agent.
The Depositary Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such
duties as are specifically set forth herein (including as set forth in
Article 1), and as set forth in any additional written escrow instructions
which the Depositary Agent may receive after the date of this Agreement which
are signed by an officer of Broadcom and the Stockholder Agent, and may rely
and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument
reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper party or parties. The Depositary Agent shall not be liable for any act
done or omitted hereunder as Depositary Agent while acting in good faith and
in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant
to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.  
(ii) Compliance with Orders. The Depositary Agent is hereby expressly
authorized to comply with and obey Orders of any court of law or Governmental
or Regulatory Authority, notwithstanding any notices, warnings or other
communications from any party or any other Person to the contrary. In
case the Depositary Agent obeys or    -71-  79  complies with any such
Order, the Depositary Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto
or to any other Person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such
Order being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or
found to have been entered without jurisdiction or proper authority.  
(iii) Limitations on Liability of Depositary Agent. The Depositary Agent
shall not be liable in any respect on account of (A) the identity, authority
or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or
deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for
hereunder; or (B) the expiration of any rights under any statute of
limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents deposited with
the Depositary Agent.   (iv) Good Faith of Depositary Agent. In performing
any duties under the Agreement, the Depositary Agent shall not be liable to
any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Depositary Agent. The Depositary Agent
shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or
omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon
any instrument, including any written statement or affidavit provided for in
this Agreement that the Depositary Agent shall in good faith believe to be
genuine, nor will the Depositary Agent be liable or responsible for
forgeries, fraud, impersonations or determining the scope of any
representative authority. In addition, the Depositary Agent may consult with
legal counsel in connection with the Depositary Agent\'s duties under this
Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or
permitted by him, her or it in good faith in accordance with the advice of
counsel. The Depositary Agent is not responsible for determining and
verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf
of any party to this Agreement.   (v) Non-responsibility of Depositary
Agent. If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or
with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its
terms or conditions, the Depositary Agent will not be required to determine
the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Depositary Agent may
hold all documents and shares of Broadcom Common Stock and may wait for
settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or
other means as, in the Depositary Agent\'s discretion, the Depositary Agent
may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.
In such event, the Depositary Agent will not be liable for any damages.
Furthermore, the Depositary Agent may at its option, file an action of
interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and
rights among themselves. The Depositary Agent is authorized to deposit with
the clerk of the court all documents and shares of Broadcom Common Stock held
in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and reasonable attorney fees
incurred by the Depositary Agent due to the interpleader action and which the
parties jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating such action, the
Depositary Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from all
obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.   (vi)
Indemnification of Depositary Agent. Broadcom and its successors and assigns
agrees to indemnify and hold the Depositary Agent harmless against any and
all Losses incurred by the Depositary Agent in connection with the
performance of    -72-  80  the Depositary Agent\'s duties under this
Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising from this
Agreement or involving its subject matter.   (vii) Resignation of Depositary
Agent. The Depositary Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least
thirty (30) days written notice to the parties; provided, however, that no
such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor
depositary agent which shall be accomplished as follows: the parties shall
use their reasonable best efforts to mutually agree on a successor depositary
agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If the parties
fail to agree upon a successor depositary agent within such time, the
Depositary Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor depositary agent
authorized to do business in the State of California. The successor
depositary agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such
appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all
the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor
depositary agent as if originally named as Depositary Agent. The Depositary
Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under this
Agreement.   (m) Fees. All fees of the Depositary Agent for performance of
its duties hereunder shall be paid by Broadcom. In the event that the
conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Depositary
Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the
parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any
controversy arises, or if the Depositary Agent is made a party to, or
intervenes in, any Action or Proceeding pertaining to this escrow or its
subject matter, the Depositary Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such
extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorney\'s fees, and
expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or Action or
Proceeding. Broadcom agrees to pay these sums upon demand.   (n) When used
in this Section 7.2, the phrase "stockholders of the Company" means any
holders of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time.   ARTICLE 8

continued right to exercise, appraisal, dissenters\' or similar rights under
applicable law with respect to their shares by virtue of the Merger;   (g)
by Broadcom, if the Merger shall not have been approved by the requisite

or, in any solicitation of stockholder written consents with respect to the
Merger, within twenty (20) days after the record date established for
determining the stockholders of the Company entitled to consent;   (h) by
Broadcom, if any of the individuals listed on Schedule 6.3(j) cease to be
employed by the Company, provided, however, that Broadcom may exercise this
termination right with respect to a particular individual named in Schedule
6.3(j) only if Broadcom gives the Company written notice of termination of
the Agreement within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of
written notice from the Company that such individual has ceased to be
employed by the Company; and provided, further, that if Broadcom does not

termination; and provided further that, the provisions of Sections 5.4, 5.5
and 8.2, Article 9 (exclusive of Section 9.3) and the applicable definitions
set forth in Article 10 shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement.   8.3 Amendment. Except as is otherwise
required by applicable law after the stockholders of the Company approve the
Merger and this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
