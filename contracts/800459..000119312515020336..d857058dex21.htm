the foregoing provisions hereof. Shearman shall be permitted to withdraw from any representation of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company in order to be able to represent or continue so representing the Securityholders, even if such

neither Parent, the Company nor the Surviving Company, nor any Person acting on behalf of or through Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company, will seek to obtain or use the Privilege Assets without the Representative&#146;s consent, provided
that the Representative shall not unreasonably withhold its consent if any such Person is seeking to use such Privilege Assets in defense or prosecution of a claim brought by or against a third party that is not a Securityholder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing shall prevent Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company or any Person acting on behalf of or through any of them from complying with applicable Law or court order. After the Closing, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Katz
