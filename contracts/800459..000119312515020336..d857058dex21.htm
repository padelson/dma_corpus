(B) automatically be canceled and extinguished, no longer be outstanding and
cease to represent the right to acquire shares of Common Stock, without any
payment of any consideration therefor; and (ii) each In-the-Money Option that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall (A) if not
previously vested, vest as of the Effective Time, and (B) automatically be
canceled and extinguished, no longer be outstanding and cease to represent
the right to acquire shares of Common Stock, and in consideration therefor,
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without

_Section 8.04(e)_.

(b) _Effect on Restricted Stock Units_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, without any further
action on the part of the Company or of any Securityholder, each Restricted
Stock Unit shall, at the Effective Time, automatically be canceled and
extinguished, no longer be outstanding and cease to represent the right to
acquire shares of Common Stock, and in consideration therefor, the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Consideration, to be paid as
such Restricted Stock Unit otherwise would have vested or, if later, in
accordance with _Section 2.02(c)_, _Section 1.07(b)_,  _Section 1.07(c)_,
_Section 1.08_, _Section 1.09_, _Section 8.03(h)_ and _Section 8.04(e)_.
For purposes of this Agreement, the date a Restricted Stock Unit otherwise
would have vested shall be determined in accordance with _Annex 1.03(b)_, it
being understood that if the employment of the applicable Restricted Stock

 



4  Unit Holder with the Company and its Affiliates terminates prior to a
vesting date set forth on such schedule, the right to the corresponding
Restricted Stock Unit Consideration shall be forfeited (any such
consideration so forfeited, a " _Forfeited Amount_ ").

(c) _Payment_. The Closing Option Consideration and Closing Restricted Stock
Unit Consideration (in each case based on the Estimated Base Purchase Price
Statement) payable to the Optionholders and Restricted Stock Unit Holders
pursuant to _Sections 1.03(a)_ and  _1.03(b)_ , respectively, shall be paid
through the Surviving Companys payroll system on the first regular payroll
date of the Surviving Company after such consideration is payable pursuant to
_Sections 1.03(a)_ and  _1.03(b)_.

(d) _Necessary Actions_. The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, in
consultation with Parent, take all actions reasonably necessary in order to
effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 1.03_; _provided_ that
Parent shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any
written corporate action to be taken by the Company.

Section 1.04 _Exchange of Company Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and Merger Sub shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company, or a
subsidiary thereof, to act as paying and exchange agent hereunder (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). After the Closing, promptly following surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a certificate representing share(s) of Company Stock (each,
a " _Certificate_ "), together with a duly completed and executed letter of
transmittal, substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ attached hereto (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), which Letter of Transmittal shall in any event
include confirmation of being bound by indemnification and related obligations
and appointment of the Representative in such form and binding on the
Securityholder executing the same, the holders of certificates will be
entitled to receive the amount payable at the Closing in cash with respect to
such share(s) of Company Stock held by such holder as provided in _Section
1.02_, payable, at the Surviving Companys option, by check or wire transfer
of immediately available funds. At the Effective Time, the share transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Stock theretofore outstanding on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the
shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any
shares of Company Stock presented to the Exchange Agent for any reason shall
be exchanged for the consideration theretofore payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 1.02_ without any interest thereon, subject to the
execution of a duly completed Letter of Transmittal. None of Parent, the
Surviving Company or their Affiliates shall be liable to any Securityholder
for any amount paid to any public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat, or similar laws. Any amount remaining unclaimed by
Securityholders six (6) months after the Closing Date (or such earlier date,
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Company free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 1.05 _Closing Calculations_. Not less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
statement (the " _Estimated Base Purchase Price Statement_ ") setting forth,
in each case as of the Reference Time, 

 



5  (a) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Group Companies, (b) good
faith calculations of estimated Adjusted EBITDA, estimated Cash, estimated
Debt, estimated Net Indebtedness and estimated Net Working Capital (it being
understood that Net Working Capital shall be in the form set forth in _Annex
12.01(c)_ ), (c) good faith calculations of the Companys estimate of the Base
Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Base Purchase Price_ "), estimated aggregate
Closing Option Consideration, a schedule of the estimated Closing Option
Consideration for each First Tier In-the-Money Option, estimated aggregate
Closing Restricted Stock Unit Consideration in respect of Restricted Stock
Units, estimated Per Share Participating Amount, estimated Series A Per Share
Amount, estimated Series A-1 Per Share Amount and estimated Series B Per Share
Amount and (d) estimated Fully Diluted Shares (as calculated pursuant
to clause (a) of the definition thereof) (the amounts set forth pursuant to
clauses (b), (c) and (d), collectively, the " _Estimated Amounts_ "). The
Estimated Base Purchase Price Statement and the determinations
contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with this Agreement,
including the Accounting Principles. Not less than two (2) Business Days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall notify the Company in the event
that it disputes any aspect of the Estimated Base Purchase Price Statement,
the determinations therein or the calculations thereof. Prior to the Closing
Date, Parent and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
any such dispute (or any aspect thereof). If any such dispute is resolved
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent
prior to the anticipated Closing Date a new statement setting forth the
information required pursuant to clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this
_Section 1.05_, which shall be the Estimated Base Purchase Price Statement
for purposes of this Agreement. Parents failure to timely notify the Company
that it disputes an aspect of the Estimated Base Purchase Price Statement, or
the Parties resolution of or failure to resolve any dispute raised pursuant
to this _Section 1.05_, shall not prejudice Parents ability to dispute or
raise objections to any aspect of the Estimated Base Purchase Price Statement
or the determination of the Estimated Amounts following the Closing Date, and,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that no dispute
related to the Estimated Base Purchase Price Statement shall in and of itself
delay or condition the occurrence of the Closing.

Section 1.06 _Base Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) Promptly (but no later than the date that is seventy-five (75) days after
Closing), Parent shall deliver to the Representative a statement (the "
_Final Base Purchase Price Statement_ ") setting forth, in each case as of the
Reference Time, (a) the actual consolidated balance sheet of the Group
Companies, (b) good faith calculations of actual Adjusted EBITDA (as finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 1.06_, the " _Actual Adjusted
EBITDA_ "), actual Cash, actual Debt, actual Net Indebtedness and actual Net
Working Capital (it being understood that Net Working Capital shall be in the
form set forth in _Annex 12.01(c)_ ), (c) good faith calculations of the
actual Base Purchase Price, actual aggregate Closing Option Consideration, a
schedule of the actual Closing Option Consideration for each First Tier In-
the-Money Option, actual aggregate Closing Restricted Stock Unit Consideration
in respect of Restricted Stock Units, actual Per Share Participating Amount,
actual Series A Per Share Amount, actual Series A-1 Per Share Amount and
actual Series B Per Share Amount and (d) actual Fully Diluted Shares (as
calculated pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof). The Final Base
Purchase Price Statement and the determinations contained therein shall be
prepared in accordance with this Agreement, including the Accounting
Principles. After delivery of the Final Base Purchase Price Statement, the
Representative and its accountants and other

 



6  representatives shall be permitted reasonable access at reasonable times
during the thirty (30)-day period after delivery of the Final Base
Purchase Price Statement to review the Surviving Companys and its
Subsidiaries books and records and any work papers (subject to the
Representative and its representatives entering into any reasonable
undertakings required by Parents accountants in connection therewith)
related to the preparation of the Final Base Purchase Price Statement;
_provided_ , that they do not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of Parent or the Surviving Company. If the Representative has any
objections to the Final Base Purchase Price Statement (to which it may object
only on the basis that it contains mathematical errors or was not prepared in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Accounting Principles), the
Representative shall deliver to Parent a written statement (an " _Objections
Statement_ ") stating that the Representative believes the Final Base Purchase
Price Statement contains mathematical errors or was not prepared
in accordance with this Agreement, including the Accounting Principles, and
specifying in reasonable detail each item that the Representative disputes
(each, a " _Disputed Item_ ") and the amount in dispute for each Disputed Item
and the reasons supporting the Representatives positions. The Representative
shall not challenge the Final Base Purchase Price Statement on any basis other
than as set forth in the timely delivered Objections Statement and shall be
deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Final
Base Purchase Price Statement. If an Objections Statement is not delivered to
Parent within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the Final
Base Purchase Price Statement, the Final Base Purchase Price Statement shall
be final and binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. The Representative
and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Disputed Items, but
if they do not reach a final resolution within fifteen (15) days after the
delivery of the Objections Statement, the Representative and Parent shall
submit such dispute to the New York City office of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
or if the New York City office of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is unwilling or
unable to fulfill such role, to a nationally recognized independent accounting
firm mutually acceptable to Parent and the Representative (the " _Dispute
Resolution Arbiter_ "). Any further submissions to the Dispute Resolution
Arbiter must be written and delivered to each of Parent and the
Representative. The Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall consider only those items
and amounts that are identified in the Objections Statement as Disputed
Items. The Dispute Resolution Arbiters determination shall be based solely on
the Accounting Principles, the definitions of Actual Adjusted EBITDA, Cash,
Debt, Net Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, Base Purchase Price, Closing
Option Consideration, Closing Restricted Stock Unit Consideration, Per Share
Participating Amount, Series A Per Share Amount, Series A-1 Per Share Amount
and Series B Per Share Amount contained herein and the provisions of this
Agreement, including this _Section 1.06_. The Representative and Parent shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution
Arbiter to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable in amounts
between the disputed amounts set forth in the Final Base Purchase Price
Statement and the Objections Statement. The Dispute Resolution Arbiters
determination shall be based solely on the presentations by Parent and the
Representative that are in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth
in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent review). The
resolution of the dispute by the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be final
and binding on and nonappealable by the Parties hereto. The fees and expenses
of the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be allocated between Parent and the
Representative in such manner that the Representative shall be responsible
for that portion of the fees and expenses equal to such fees and expenses
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate dollar amount
in dispute in respect of Disputed Items submitted to the Dispute Resolution
Arbiter that are resolved in a manner further from the position submitted to
the Dispute Resolution Arbiter by the Representative and closer to the
position submitted to the

 



7  Dispute Resolution Arbiter by Parent (as finally determined by the Dispute
Resolution Arbiter), and the denominator of which is the total aggregate
dollar amount in dispute in respect of Disputed Items so submitted, and
Parent shall be responsible for the remainder of such fees and expenses. For
the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not limit claims for Losses under
this Agreement to the extent that a Party has a claim for Losses under this
Agreement other than in connection with the determination of the Base Purchase
Price and has not been fully compensated for such Losses, including not
limiting such claims if, for example, as a result of the inclusion of any
liabilities in connection with such determination of the Base Purchase Price,
the representation with respect to the Financial Statements in _Section 3.06_
is inaccurate.

 

(b) If the Base Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to _Section
1.06(a)_ (the " _Final Base Purchase Price_ ") is greater than the Estimated
Base Purchase Price, the aggregate payment, if any, to which Securityholders
are otherwise entitled pursuant to _Section 1.07(b)_ shall be increased by
the difference of the Final Base Purchase Price less the Estimated Base
Purchase Price (such difference, the " _Base Purchase Price Excess_ "), as
provided in such _Section 1.07(b)_.

 

(c) If the Final Base Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Base Purchase
Price, the aggregate payment, if any, to which Securityholders are otherwise
entitled pursuant to _Section 1.07(b)_ shall be decreased by the difference
of the Estimated Base Purchase Price less the Final Base Purchase Price (such
difference, the " _Base Purchase Price Shortfall_ "), as provided in such
_Section 1.07(b)_. In the event that the Base Purchase Price Shortfall
exceeds the aggregate payment, if any, to which Securityholders are otherwise
entitled pursuant to _Section 1.07(b)_ (the amount of such excess, the "
_Unrecovered Amount_ "), (i) the Adjusted Earn-Out Amount, if any, payable
pursuant to _Section 1.07(c)_ shall be reduced by the amount of the
Unrecovered Amount (but not below zero) and (ii) if, after application of
clause (i) of this _Section 1.06(c)_, the Unrecovered Amount has not been
fully recovered, the Major Holders, on a several basis, shall promptly (but in
any event within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the
2015 Revenue in accordance with _Section 1.07(a)_) deliver each such Major
Holders Pro Rata Indemnification Percentage of the remaining portion of the
Base Purchase Price Shortfall by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to one (1) or more accounts designated by the Surviving Company to the Major
Holders.

 

Section 1.07 _Additional Consideration_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable after the end of the Earn-Out Period (but in no
event later than January 30, 2016), Parent shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the Representative a statement of the Revenue (the " _2015
Revenue_") of the Company (such statement, the " _Revenue Statement_ ")
for the twelve (12) months ended December 31, 2015 (the " _Earn-Out
Period_"), which shall be prepared in accordance with the definition of 2015
Revenue contained in this Agreement, including the Accounting Principles.
After delivery of the Revenue Statement, the Representative and its
accountants and other representatives shall be permitted reasonable access at
reasonable times to review the Surviving Companys and its Subsidiaries
books and records and any work papers (subject to the Representative and its
representatives entering into any reasonable undertakings required by Parents
accountants in connection 

 



8  therewith) related to the preparation of the Revenue Statement. If the
Representative has any objections to the Revenue Statement, the Representative
shall deliver to Parent an Objections Statement stating that the
Representative believes the Revenue Statement contains mathematical errors or
was not prepared in accordance with this Agreement and specifying in
reasonable detail each Disputed Item and the amount in dispute for each
Disputed Item and the reasons supporting the Representatives positions. The
Representative shall not challenge the Revenue Statement on any basis other
than as set forth in the timely delivered Objections Statement and shall
be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the
Revenue Statement. If an Objections Statement is not delivered to Parent
within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the Revenue
Statement, the Revenue Statement shall be final and binding on and non-
appealable by the Parties. The Representative and Parent shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any Disputed Items, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Objections
Statement, the Representative and Parent shall submit such dispute to the
Dispute Resolution Arbiter. Any further submissions to the Dispute Resolution
Arbiter must be written and delivered to each of Parent and the
Representative. The Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall consider only those items
and amounts that are identified in the Objections Statement as Disputed Items.
The Dispute Resolution Arbiters determination shall be based solely on the
Accounting Principles, the definition of 2015 Revenue contained herein and the
provisions of this Agreement, including this _Section 1.07_. The
Representative and Parent shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Dispute Resolution Arbiter to resolve all disagreements as soon as
practicable in amounts between the disputed amounts set forth in the Revenue
Statement and the Objections Statement. The Dispute Resolution Arbiters
determination shall be based solely on the presentations by Parent and the
Representative that are in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth
in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an independent review). The
resolution of the dispute by the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be final and
binding on and nonappealable by the Parties hereto. The fees and expenses of
the Dispute Resolution Arbiter shall be allocated between Parent and
the Representative in such manner that the Representative shall be
responsible for that portion of the fees and expenses equal to such fees and
expenses multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate
dollar amount in dispute in respect of Disputed Items submitted to the
Dispute Resolution Arbiter that are resolved in a manner further from the
position submitted to the Dispute Resolution Arbiter by the Representative and
closer to the position submitted to the Dispute Resolution Arbiter by Parent
(as finally determined by the Dispute Resolution Arbiter), and the denominator
of which is the total aggregate dollar amount in dispute in respect of the
Disputed Items so submitted, and Parent shall be responsible for
the remainder of such fees and expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not limit claims for Losses under this Agreement to the extent
that a Party has a claim for Losses under this Agreement other than in
connection with the determination of 2015 Revenue.

(b) Subject to _Sections 1.08_, _1.09_ , _1.10_ , _1.12_ , _7.01(e)_ and 
_8.04_ , no later than February 5, 2016 (or, if later, five (5) Business Days
following determination of the Final Base Purchase Price), the Securityholders
shall be entitled to an amount, if any, in cash equal to (i) the
Floor Adjustment Amount plus (ii) the Base Purchase Price Excess, if a
positive number, less (iii) the Base Purchase Price Shortfall, if a positive
number (clauses (i) through (iv), the " _Additional Consideration_ "),
subject to reduction as set forth in this Agreement. The Surviving Company
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) (A) subject to
_Section 1.12_ deliver to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of Common
Stockholders and Preferred

 



9  Stockholders in respect of shares of Company Stock other than Rollover
Shares (and Dissenting Shares) held by them as of the Reference Time, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Additional Consideration, less
the sum of the Reduction Amount and the Second Tier Aggregate Catch-Up Option
Consideration, if any, multiplied by (2) the Non-Rollover Stockholder
Percentage (such product, the " _Additional Non-Rollover Stockholder
Consideration_"), and the Exchange Agent shall distribute to each such Common
Stockholder and Preferred Stockholder (other than holders of
Dissenting Shares) its Pro Rata Non-Rollover Stock Percentage of the
Additional Non-Rollover Stockholder Consideration, (B) deliver to the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of Common Stockholders and Preferred Stockholders in
respect of Rollover Shares held by them as of the Reference Time, an amount in
cash equal to the product of (1) the Additional Consideration, less the sum of
the Reduction Amount and the Second Tier Aggregate Catch-Up Option
Consideration, if any, multiplied by (2) the Rollover Stockholder Percentage
(such product, the " _Additional Rollover Stockholder Cash Consideration_ "),
and the Exchange Agent shall distribute to each such Common Stockholder and
Preferred Stockholder its Pro Rata Rollover Stock Percentage of the Additional
Rollover Stockholder Cash Consideration, (C) pay to the holders of First Tier
In-the-Money Options and Restricted Stock Units in respect of First Tier In-
the-Money Options and Restricted Stock Units held by them as of the Reference
Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Additional
Consideration, less the sum of the Reduction Amount and the Second Tier
Aggregate Catch-Up Option Consideration, if any, multiplied by (2) the First
Tier Award Holder Percentage (such product, the " _Additional Award Holder
Consideration_ "), less the aggregate applicable Forfeited Amounts, with the
Surviving Company to distribute to each such holder of such First Tier In-the-
Money Options and Restricted Stock Units its First Tier Pro Rata Award
Percentage of the Additional Award Holder Consideration (less any applicable
Forfeited Amounts) through the Surviving Companys payroll system on the next
normal payroll date of the Surviving Company and (D) pay to each holder of
Second Tier In-the-Money Options in respect of the Second Tier In-the-Money
Options held by them as of the Reference Time, an amount in cash equal to the
Second Tier Option Catch-Up Consideration with respect to such Second Tier In-
the-Money Options, with payment to be made through the Surviving Companys
payroll system on the next normal payroll date of the Surviving Company.

(c) Subject to _Sections 1.08_,  _1.09_ , _1.10_ and _1.12_ , _7.01(e)_ and
_8.04_ , promptly following the final determination of 2015 Revenue in
accordance with _Section 1.07(a)_ (but in no event prior to the time that
Merger Sub is required to make payments pursuant to _Section 1.07(b)_), the
Securityholders shall be entitled to an amount, if any, in cash, subject to
reduction pursuant to _Section 1.06(c)_ and _Section 10.04(c)_, (the "
_Adjusted Earn-Out Amount_") equal to (i) the Earn-Out Amount, less (ii) the
Floor Adjustment Amount. The Surviving Company shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to) (A) subject to _Section 1.12_ deliver to the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of Common Stockholders and Preferred
Stockholders in respect of the shares of Company Stock held by them as of the
Reference Time (other than Dissenting Shares), an amount equal to the product
of (1) the Adjusted Earn-Out Amount less the Earn-Out Holdback Amount (the "
_Deliverable Adjusted Earn-Out Amount_ ") multiplied by (2) the Stockholder
Percentage, and the Exchange Agent shall distribute to each such Common
Stockholder and Preferred Stockholder (other than holders of Dissenting
Shares) its Pro Rata Stock Percentage of the Deliverable Adjusted Earn-Out
Amount, and (B) pay to the holders of In-the-Money Options and Restricted
Stock Units in respect of In-the-Money Options and Restricted Stock Units held
by them as of the Reference Time, an amount equal to the

 



10  product of (1) the Deliverable Adjusted Earn-Out Amount, multiplied by (2)
the Award Holder Percentage, less the aggregate applicable Forfeited Amounts,
with the Surviving Company to distribute to each such holder of such In-the-
Money Options or Restricted Stock Units its Pro Rata Award Percentage of
the Deliverable Adjusted Earn-Out Amount (less any applicable Forfeited
Amounts) through the Surviving Companys payroll system on the next normal
payroll date of the Surviving Company; _provided_ , that if the Group
Companies have not acquired beneficial and record ownership of 100% of the
Fully Diluted Aditi Shares by the time of the payment of the Adjusted Earn-Out
Amount (the number of Fully Diluted Aditi Shares not so acquired at such
time, the " _Missing Aditi Shares_ "), an amount equal to the product of (1)
the Adjusted Earn-Out Amount, (2) the quotient of the 2015 Revenue of
Aditi Technologies Private Limited over the total 2015 Revenue, and (3) the
quotient of the Missing Aditi Shares over the Fully Diluted Aditi Shares,
shall be withheld by the Surviving Company from the payments to be made
pursuant to this  _Section 1.07(c)_ (such unpaid amount, the " _Unpaid Aditi
Earn-Out_"), and shall be paid in accordance with the second sentence of this
_Section 1.07(c)_ (i) in the event the "Second Closing Sale Shares" (as
defined in the Aditi Stock Purchase Agreement) are acquired by the Company at
one time, in its entirety within ten (10) Business Days of the date of the
Second Closing (as defined in the Aditi Stock Purchase Agreement) or (ii)
otherwise, within ten (10) Business Days of each date on which the Company
acquires beneficial and record ownership of additional shares since the last
payment pursuant to this  _Section 1.07(b)_ (the " _Partial Closing Shares_
") constituting at least five percent (5%) of the Fully Diluted Aditi Shares
(or, if less, the number of shares constituting the remaining number of
Missing Aditi Shares (excluding shares held by the Missing Shareholders (as
defined below))), the payment on such date equal to the applicable Unpaid
Aditi Earn-Out Amount (for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of each
of clauses (i) and (ii), whether or not the Fully Diluted Aditi Shares held
by the Missing Shareholders, as defined in the Aditi Stock Purchase Agreement,
have heretofore been acquired by the Company). Until paid, the Unpaid Aditi
Earn-Out may be subject to set-off or holdback in respect of claims by the
Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Article X_ or _Article VIII_ (with
the final disposition of any amount so held back or set off to occur only
following and in accordance with the resolution of any such claim pursuant to
the terms and conditions of _Article X_ or _Article VIII_, as
applicable), including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to _Section
8.04(h)(ii)_.

(d) From and after the Effective Time until December 31, 2015, and subject to
the Employment Agreements, the Surviving Company shall be operated as an
autonomous business unit of Parent, in a manner consistent with _Annex III_,
led by Sanjay Dhawan and Pradeep Chaudhry for so long as such individuals
remain employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective
Time until December 31, 2015, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to subcontract internal development work of it or its other Affiliates
utilizing at least 200 employees to the Surviving Company by December 31,
2015.

(e) If, during the Earn-Out Period, Parent (i) effects a Change of Control of
the Company, (ii) terminates the employment of any of the Executives without
Cause or any of the Executives terminates his employment for Good Reason or
(iii) materially breaches its obligations set forth in _Section 1.07(d)_ of
this Agreement which breach is not cured within ten (10) Business Days
following receipt by Parent of written notice from the Representative of such
a material breach (each of clause (i), (ii) and (iii), an " _Annualization
Event_ "), then (A) in the event of an Annualization Event described in clause
(i), 2015 Revenue shall be calculated as 

 



11  the product of (x) Revenue during the period from January 1, 2015 through
the date of the Annualization Event multiplied by (y) a ratio (I) the
numerator of which is total Revenue in 2014 and (II) the denominator of which
is Revenue in 2014 during the period from January 1, 2014 through the date
that is one year prior to the date of the Annualization Event and (B) in the
event of an Annualization Event described in clause (ii) or (iii) that occurs
prior to an Annualization Event described in clause (i), the Representative
shall have the right to elect, by giving written notice to Parent not later
than the thirtieth (30th) day following the first date of the Annualization
Event to occur, that 2015 Revenue be calculated based on actual 2015 Revenue
(and in such event if no such notice is validly given 2015 Revenue shall be
calculated as provided in clause (A)). For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event will the occurrence of an Annualization Event accelerate or otherwise
change the date of payment of the Adjusted Earn-Out. For purposes of
illustration only, if the Annualization Event occurred on June 30,
2015, Revenue for the first six (6) months of 2014 was $40.00, Revenue for
the second six (6) months of 2014 was $60.00 and Revenue for the first six (6)
months of 2015 was $50.00, annualized 2015 Revenue following the June 30,
2015 Annualization Event would be $125.00 (and for the avoidance of doubt,
not $100.00).

Section 1.08 _Escrow_. Prior to the Closing, the Representative, Parent and
Merger Sub shall enter into an Escrow Agreement with the Escrow Agent
substantially in the form of _Exhibit E_, subject to any administrative
changes as may be required by the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").
Concurrently with the payment to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
1.07(b)_, the Surviving Company shall deposit an amount of cash equal to the
Escrow Amount (but only to the extent of the excess, if any, of (a) the
Additional Consideration over (b) the sum of (1) the Additional Consideration
Holdback Amount, (2) the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount, (3) the Stockholder
Tax Special Fund, (4) the Second Tier Aggregate Catch-Up Option
Consideration, if any and (5) the Premium Amount, if applicable) with the
Escrow Agent for use in connection with the Securityholders obligations
pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. Subject to
_Section 7.01(e)_ any Escrow Amount remaining on the General Survival
Termination Date (but in any event not before payment to the Exchange Agent is
required to be made pursuant to  _Section 1.07(b)_) shall be paid by the
Escrow Agent (but in any event, not before the payment is made to the Exchange
Agent pursuant _Section 1.07(b)_) (and Parent and the Representative shall
cause the applicable Parent Authorized Person and Representative Authorized
Person, respectively, promptly to deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Written
Direction instructing the Escrow Agent to make such deliveries) (A) subject to
_Section 1.12_ by delivering to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
Common Stockholders and Preferred Stockholders in respect of the shares of
Company Stock held by them as of the Reference Time (other than Dissenting
Shares), an amount equal to the product of (1) the portion of the Escrow
Amount to be distributed multiplied by (2) the Stockholder Percentage, and the
Exchange Agent shall distribute to each such Common Stockholder and Preferred
Stockholder (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) its Pro Rata Stock
Percentage of the portion of the Escrow Amount so distributed, and (B) by
delivering to the Surviving Company for the benefit of the holders of In-the-
Money Options and Restricted Stock Units in respect of In-the-Money Options
and Restricted Stock Units held by them as of the Reference Time, an amount
equal to the product of (1) the portion of the Escrow Amount to be
distributed, multiplied by (2) the Award Holder Percentage, less the aggregate
applicable Forfeited Amounts, with the Surviving Company to distribute to
each such holder of such In-the-Money Options or Restricted Stock Units its
Pro Rata Award Percentage of the portion of the Escrow Amount so

 



12  distributed (less any applicable Forfeited Amounts) through the Surviving
Companys payroll system on the next normal payroll date of the Surviving
Company, on or as promptly as practicable after the General Survival
Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent a Parent
Indemnified Party has delivered an Indemnification Notice in respect of any
claim(s) as of the General Survival Termination Date that has not yet been
resolved, the amount of any and all such unresolved claims shall continue to
be held back by the Escrow Agent until the final resolution of any such
unresolved claim pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Upon the final
resolution of any such unresolved claim after the General Survival
Termination Date, (a) if and to the extent any such claim is resolved such
that a Parent Indemnified Party is owed indemnification by the Securityholders
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Parent and the Representative shall
cause the applicable Parent Authorized Person and Representative Authorized
Person, respectively, promptly to deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Written
Direction instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the applicable Parent
Indemnified Party that portion of the Escrow Amount and (b) if and to the
extent any such claim is resolved such that the applicable Parent Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification from the Securityholders pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, the portion of the Escrow Amount relating to such
claim (or the portion of such claim for which the applicable Parent
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification) shall be released (but
only to the extent that the amount of funds remaining in the escrow account
would otherwise exceed the aggregate amount of all unresolved claims) and
Parent and the Representative shall cause the applicable Parent Authorized
Person and Representative Authorized Person, respectively, promptly to
deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Written Direction instructing the Escrow
Agent to (A) subject to _Section 1.12_ deliver to the Exchange Agent, for the
benefit of the Common Stockholders and Preferred Stockholders in respect of
the shares of Company Stock held by them as of the Reference Time (other than
Dissenting Shares), an amount equal to the product of (1) the portion of the
Escrow Amount to be distributed multiplied by (2) the Stockholder Percentage,
and the Exchange Agent shall distribute to each such Common Stockholder and
Preferred Stockholder (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) its Pro Rata
Stock Percentage of the portion of the Escrow Amount so distributed, and (B)
deliver to the Surviving Company for the benefit of the holders of In-the-
Money Options and Restricted Stock Units in respect of In-the-Money Options
and Restricted Stock Units held by them as of the Reference Time, an amount
equal to the product of (1) the portion of the Escrow Amount to
be distributed, multiplied by (2) the Award Holder Percentage, less the
aggregate applicable Forfeited Amounts, with the Surviving Company to
distribute to each such holder of such In-the-Money Options or Restricted
Stock Units its Pro Rata Award Percentage of the portion of the Escrow Amount
so distributed (less any applicable Forfeited Amounts) through the Surviving
Companys payroll system on the next normal payroll date of the Surviving
Company.

Section 1.09  _Holdback Amount_. The Surviving Company shall be entitled to
withhold from the Additional Consideration and the Adjusted Earn-Out Amount
the Additional Consideration Holdback Amount and the Earn-Out Holdback
Amount, respectively, for use in connection with the Securityholders
obligations pursuant to _Article X_ and _Sections 8.03_ and _8.04_ in
respect of claims for indemnification for which an Indemnification Notice has
been delivered prior to the payment of the Additional Consideration. Upon such
final resolution of any such unresolved claim, (a) if and to the extent any
such claim is resolved (pursuant to the terms and conditions of  _Article X_
or _Sections 8.03_ and _8.04_ , as applicable) such that a Parent Indemnified

used in), and illustrating, the calculations to be made under _Sections
1.05_,  _1.06_ and _1.07_ in accordance with this Agreement.

Section 1.12 _Dissenting Shares_. To the extent available under Section 262
of the DGCL, any share of Company Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a Common
Stockholder or Preferred Stockholder who did not consent to or vote (by a
valid and enforceable proxy or otherwise) in favor of the approval of this
Agreement, which Common Stockholder or Preferred Stockholder complies with all
of the provisions of the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of
dissenters rights (such share

 



14  being a " _Dissenting Share_ ," and such Common Stockholder or Preferred
Stockholder being a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive the consideration to which the holder of such share
would be entitled pursuant to _Section 1.02_; but rather shall be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. If
any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect such stockholders dissenters
rights under the DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights
with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon
automatically be converted into the right to receive, without any interest
thereon, the consideration referred to in _Section 1.02_, pursuant to the
exchange procedures set forth in  _Section 1.04_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or
abandoned, then the right of a stockholder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease.
The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any demand for payment of
the fair value of any shares of Company Stock or any attempted withdrawal of
any such demand for payment and any other instrument served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to any stockholders dissenters
rights and (b) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands for payment under the DGCL. The
Company shall not make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal
with respect to any Dissenting Shares without the prior written consent of
Parent.

 

Section 1.13 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to
the contrary, each of the Surviving Company, the Representative and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold under any provision of applicable Tax
Law from the amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under such provision of applicable Law;
_provided_ , that Representative and Parent shall not be entitled to deduct
and withhold with respect to any Stockholder Taxes, except as set forth in 
_Section 8.04_. If the Surviving Company, the Representative or Parent
becomes aware of any obligation to deduct or withhold under applicable Tax
Law, the Surviving Company, the Representative or Parent, as the case may be,
shall promptly notify the Person in writing of such obligation. If the
obligation to deduct or withhold can be reduced or eliminated through the
provision of an applicable certification or form, the Surviving Company, the
Representative or Parent, as the case may be, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the Person with the opportunity to complete and
provide such certification or form. If the Surviving Company, the
Representative or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds such amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

 

Section 1.14 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock of any of the foregoing,

the name of the Surviving Company is "Symphony Teleca Corporation".

Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company, and the officers of
Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving

any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period that are due (taking into
account valid extensions) after the Closing Date and for any Straddle Period.
Parent shall (A) prepare (or cause to be prepared) such Tax Returns consistent
with this Agreement and past practice and (B) provide copies of such proposed
income Tax Returns to the Representative at least fifteen (15) days prior to
the due date (including extensions) of any such Tax Returns for its review and
consent, 

 



54  which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Parent shall timely remit
(or cause to be timely remitted) to the relevant Governmental Entity any Taxes
due with respect to Tax Returns described in this _Section 8.03(a)(ii)_,
subject to its right of indemnification under _Section 8.03(b)_.

 

(iii) None of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent shall (or shall cause or
permit any Group Company to) make or change any Tax election or amend any Tax
Return, in each case, for any Pre-Closing Period, to the extent such election
or amendment would result in an increase of Taxes for the Pre-Closing Period
for which the Securityholders are responsible pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_,
without the prior written consent of the Representative, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as required
pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code or any similar provision of local, state or foreign law, provided that
this  _Section 8.03(a)(iii)_ shall not apply to the extent that Parent
agrees to forego the right to indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.03(b)(i)_ with respect to any Taxes resulting from any such Tax election or
amendment.

 

(b) _Tax Indemnification_.

 

(i) The Securityholders shall indemnify Parent, the Surviving Company, their
respective Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
agents, representatives, successors and assigns of each such Person
(collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ "), on a several basis, in
each case, for such Securityholders Pro Rata Indemnification Percentage, of
any and all Losses actually incurred or suffered by any of the Parent
Indemnified Parties, directly or indirectly, as a result of, relating to or
arising out of or constituting any Excluded Taxes. Indemnification payments
pursuant to this _Section 8.03(b)_ shall be payable (A) in the case of Taxes
shown to be due on Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Period or a Straddle Period
to be filed in accordance with  _Section 8.03(a)_, five (5) Business Days
before such payment is due to the appropriate Governmental Entity and (B), in
the case of all other Excluded Taxes, the date a final determination to such
effect is made by the appropriate Governmental Entity or court, or if
earlier, the date such Taxes are actually due, payable or paid to the
appropriate Governmental Entity (it being understood, for the avoidance of
doubt, that in the case of clause (B), a Tax is not due or payable to the
extent that such Tax may be contested prior to payment by the means selected
by the party entitled to control such contest).

 

(ii) The right of the Parent Indemnified Parties to indemnification (A)
pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)(i)_ pursuant to clause (f) of the definition of
Excluded Taxes shall not include Taxes of any Group Company that are properly
allocable to any Post-Closing Period and that result from a breach of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.10 _(other than
Sections 3.10_(k) or _3.10(n)_ ), _provided_ , that, with respect to a breach
of the representation contained in clause (iii) of  _Section 3.10(k)_, only
to the extent that the prepaid amount resulted in an actual increase of the
Final Base Purchase Price (taking into account any cash received with respect
to the prepaid amount and liability for deferred revenue related to such
prepaid amount taken into account in Debt)), (B) pursuant to _Section
8.03(b)(i) shall not include_ Taxes of any Group Company actually taken into
account in Debt, to the extent resulting in an actual reduction of the 

 



55  Final Base Purchase Price, and (C) shall not include Taxes that result from
and that would not have properly been imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries but for an election made by Parent under Section 338 of the Code
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
transaction occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing at the direction
of Parent and not expressly provided for and permitted by this Agreement.

(iii) If an adjustment to Taxes for the Pre-Closing Period that results in an
Excluded Tax for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are actually indemnified
pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)(i)_ also results in an actual reduction in cash
Taxes for the Post-Closing Period that would otherwise be payable by Parent
or any of its Affiliates, determined on a "with and without" basis, and for
the avoidance of doubt, other than as a result of any adjustment to Tax
basis, then the amount of such indemnification shall be reduced by the amount
of such reduction of Tax, provided that this _Section 8.03(b)(iii)_ shall not
apply to any such reduction of Tax realized following the date that is the
one year anniversary after the Closing Date. In the event such reduction of
Taxes payable is subsequently reduced or disallowed, the amount of Taxes to
the extent reduced or disallowed (the " _Disallowed Taxes_ ")
shall constitute indemnifiable Excluded Taxes pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_,
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) to the extent such amounts are reduced or
disallowed before the date of payment of the Additional Consideration or
the Adjusted Earn-Out Amount, respectively, the amount of the Disallowed
Taxes shall be set off against the Additional Consideration or the Earn-Out
(including the Unpaid Aditi Earn-Out, if applicable), as applicable and (B)
otherwise, the amount that would otherwise be released to the Securityholders
under the provisions of _Section 8.04_ or under _Article X_ shall be reduced
by the Disallowed Taxes and shall instead be released to Parent.

(iv) The right of the Parent Indemnified Parties to indemnification under
_Section 8.03(b)_ shall (A) survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in the manner set forth in the proviso set forth in
_Section 10.02(c)_, (B) be subject to clause (y) of the definition of
"Parent Cap" contained in the proviso contained in _Section 10.02(a)_, (C) be
recoverable in the manner set forth in _Section 10.04(c)_ and (D) each
Parent Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to
recover from the shareholders of Aditi Technologies Private Limited any
Excluded Taxes imposed on Aditi Technologies Private Limited for which
indemnification would be sought under this _Section 8.03_ after becoming
aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise thereto;
_provided_ , that, (x) no amounts that would otherwise be released to the
Securityholders as a result of such recovery shall be released until such
amounts are actually recovered by Parent, and the amount so released shall be
reduced by the amount of any costs of such recovery, (y) Parent shall have the
exclusive right to control any such efforts to recover Excluded Taxes and (z)
the obligation of the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Section
8.03(b)(iv)(D)_ shall not prevent the release and payment of any amounts to a
Governmental Entity. Except as set forth in the above provisions of this
_Section 8.03(b)(iv)_, claims for indemnification with respect to Taxes
(other than claims in respect of the representations and warranties set forth
in _Section 3.14_ or claims pursuant to  _Section 5.08_, which claims shall
be governed by Article X, and other than claims for

 



56  indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)(ix))_, shall be governed
exclusively by this _Section 8.03_ and _Section 8.04_, and the provisions of
Article X shall not apply; _provided_ , that claims for indemnification for a
breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.10(n)_
shall be indemnifiable pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of 
_Section 10.01, 10.02(a), 10.02(c) and 10.04(a), 10.04(b), 10.04(c),
10.04(e), 10.04(f), 10.04(g), 10.04(h) and 10.06 (and the other provisions of
Article X shall not apply)_.

 

(c) _Straddle Period Allocations_. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed
on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to a Straddle Period,
(i) Property Taxes of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries allocable to the
Pre-Closing Period shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period; and (ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) of the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed as if
such taxable period ended on and included the Closing Date;  _provided_ ,
that (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis shall be allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the portion of the Straddle Period ending after the
Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each such period and
(ii)(A) all compensation expenses arising in connection with payments made to
the Optionholders and Restricted Stock Unit Holders pursuant to _Sections
1.03(a)_ and _1.03(b)_ , respectively, and (B) all deductions attributable to
the Transaction Expenses, shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Period, in
each case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law (at a "more likely than
not" or greater standard) and except as required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of
local, state or foreign law.

 

(d) _Tax Proceedings_.

 

(i) If any Governmental Entity asserts a Tax Claim, then the party first
receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide written notice
thereof to the other party or parties hereto; _provided_ , that the failure to
so notify shall not relieve the party from whom indemnification is being
sought of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the party from
whom indemnification is being sought is actually and materially prejudiced by
such failure. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for
such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any
correspondence received from the Governmental Entity.

(ii) The Representative shall, subject to _Section 8.03(d)(iv)_, have
the right to control, at the Representatives expense, any audit,
examination, contest, litigation, appeal, settlement discussion or other

obtaining the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

relevant Governmental Entity, and (E) Parent shall not settle, compromise or
abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of
the Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
have the exclusive right to control (A) any Tax Proceeding in respect of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries not described in _Sections 8.03(d)(ii)_ or
_8.03(d)(iii)_ ; (B) any Tax Proceeding in respect of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries described in  _Sections 8.03(d)(ii)_ or _8.03(d)(iii)_ if
(1) such Tax Proceeding would not give rise to any indemnification obligation
pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_, (2) the Tax liability resulting from such Tax
Proceeding would not reasonably be expected to be recovered pursuant to
_Section 8.03(b)_ (taking into account, without limitation, applicable
deductions and any other pending asserted claims against the Holdback Amount

that Parent is waiving its right to indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.03(b)_ with respect to Taxes imposed as a result of the resolution of such
Tax Proceeding; and (C) any Tax Proceeding in respect of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries described in _Section 8.03(d)(ii)_ if the Representative

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Securityholders shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to terminate (or cause to be terminated) on or before the Closing
Date all Tax sharing, allocation, indemnity or similar agreements or

thereunder after the Closing.

 



58 (f) _Tax Cooperation_. The Representative, Parent and the Surviving Company
shall cooperate with each other in connection with (i) the preparation and
filing of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax Returns that include

are payable before the date of payment of the Additional Consideration or the
Earn-Out, respectively, the amount of the Seller Transfer Taxes shall be set

Aditi Earn-Out, if applicable), as applicable and (B) otherwise, the amount
that would otherwise be released to the Securityholders under the provisions
of _Section 8.04_ or under _Article X_ shall, be reduced by the Seller

(h) _Tax Refunds_. Any refund (reduced by the amount of any Taxes arising or
that would arise as a result of the receipt of such refund or interest
thereon) of Taxes for the Pre-Closing Period paid by the Securityholders,
which refund is received by Parent or any Group Company, shall be for the
account of the Securityholders but only to the extent that (i) such refund is
not reflected in Net Working Capital, (ii) such refund is not the result of an
event that occurred after the Closing Date, and (iii) such refund is not
attributable to, and does not result from, a carry back or other use of any

Closing Period or, in the case of a refund of Taxes for a Straddle Period, the
use of any such item arising in a Post-Closing Period. Subject to _Section

Stockholder its Pro Rata Stock Percentage of the amount of such refund (as
reduced as contemplated above), and (B) pay to the holders of In-the-
Money Options and Restricted Stock Units in respect of In-the-Money Options

Stock Units its Pro Rata Award

 



59  Percentage of any such refund (as reduced as contemplated above and less any
applicable Forfeited Amounts) through the Surviving Companys payroll system
on the next normal payroll date of the Surviving Company. The amount of any
other refund or Tax benefit of any Group Company shall be for the account of
Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax basis, net operating loss, credit
or other item that reduces Taxes paid or payable that may exist in any Group
Company in a Post-Closing Period or may be carried forward from a Pre-Closing
Period (after taking into account all uses by Parent or any Group Company of
any such items arising in a Pre-Closing Period and existing as of the end of

a result of an adjustment to taxable income for a Pre-Closing Period)) to a
Post-Closing Period, shall be for the account of Parent.

 

(i) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The parties hereto agree to treat
any payment made pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ or  _Article X_ as an
adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

Section 8.04 _Stockholder Taxes_.

 

(a) The Parties acknowledge and agree that Stockholder Taxes are the
responsibility of the Securityholders and that any costs and expenses of the
Securityholders or the Representative resulting from, relating to, arising out
of, or in connection with, the Stockholder Taxes are solely the responsibility
of the Securityholders. From and after the Closing, the Securityholders shall
indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties, on a several basis, in each case,
for such Securityholders Pro Rata Indemnification Percentage (and, in the
case of the Major Holders, as provided in clause (iii) below), of any and all
Losses actually incurred or suffered by any of the Parent Indemnified
Parties, directly or indirectly, as a result of, relating to, arising out of,
in connection with or constituting any Stockholder Taxes (or, for the absence
of doubt, any breach of a covenant set forth in Section 8.04), in the manner
described in this _Section 8.04_. The initial source of recovery in respect
of any indemnification claim made by any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to
this _Section 8.04_ (or a payment to a Governmental Entity pursuant to this
_Section 8.04)_ shall be, at the election of Parent, (i) first, the
Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and second, the Stockholder Tax Special Fund,
(ii) until the Escrow Amount is funded, by set-off against any Additional
Consideration and, after the Escrow Amount is funded, the Earn-Out Amount or
Holdback Amount, in respect of claims made on or prior to the date of funding
of the Escrow Amount, or the Earn-Out Amount or Escrow Amount (in which event
Parent and the Representative shall cause the applicable Parent Authorized
Person and Representative Authorized Person, respectively, promptly to
deliver to the Escrow Agent a Joint Written Direction providing for the
release of the relevant funds to the applicable Parent Indemnified Parties),
in respect of claims made after the date of funding of the Escrow Amount, and
(iii) if the amounts pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) are insufficient,
against the Major Holders severally, in accordance with their Pro Rata
Indemnification Percentages, _provided_ , that in no event shall the
aggregate liability of the Major Holders exceed the aggregate consideration
paid to the Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement and the Rollover
Agreements. Each Parent Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to seek to recover from the shareholders of Aditi Technologies
Private Limited any Stockholder Taxes in respect of the Aditi Acquisition for
which indemnification would be sought under this _Section 8.04_ after
becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no amounts that would otherwise be
released to the Securityholders under this

 



60   _Section 8.04_ as a result of such recovery shall be released until such
amounts are actually recovered by Parent, and the amount so released shall be
reduced by the amount of any costs or expenses incurred in connection with
such recovery, (B) Parent shall have the exclusive right to control any
proceeding, action, contest, litigation, appeal, settlement discussion, and
efforts to recover Stockholder Taxes in respect of the Aditi Acquisition and
(C) the obligation of the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this sentence
of this _Section 8.04(a)_ shall not prevent the release and payment of any
amounts to an Indian Governmental Entity.

 

(b) The Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and the Stockholder Tax Special Fund
shall be released pursuant to the terms of  _Section 8.04(e)_, in whole or
part, within three (3) Business Days after the earliest of: (i) the
Representative obtaining an insurance policy reasonably satisfactory to Parent
(including as to the provider of the policy) insuring for the benefit of
Parent and any of its Affiliates (including any Group Company) for the risk of
imposition of the Stockholder Taxes with respect to the Transactions, with the
released amount of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and the Stockholder
Tax Special Fund equal, in such case, to the lesser of (A) the current balance
of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and the Stockholder Tax Special Fund,
less (I) any claims made or pending against the Stockholder Tax Holdback
Amount or the Stockholder Tax Special Fund and (II) any deductible or
retention under such insurance policy, and (B) the covered amount (for the
avoidance of doubt, reflecting reduction for any deductible or retention) of
such insurance policy, calculated in the manner set forth in the example
contained in _Section 8.04(h)(ii)_ (with the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount
being released first, and the Stockholder Tax Special Fund being released
second), and provided that all premiums in respect of such insurance policy
shall be borne and paid for by the Securityholders as set forth in _Section
8.04(h)(ii)_ below); (ii) one (1) year following the receipt (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, such time required to resolve the amount of Taxes
due) by the Representative of a final and binding tax ruling from the Indian
Authority for Advance Rulings (Income Tax) to the effect that, with respect to
the Transactions, either (A) no Stockholder Taxes are due or (B) the Parent
Indemnified Parties are not liable for any unpaid Stockholder Taxes, unless
such ruling is appealed or otherwise formally challenged, after the date of
such ruling, by an applicable Indian Governmental Authority; (iii) an Indian
Tax Advisor providing an opinion to Parent, at a "should" or greater level of
comfort reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Parent, that based on
an enacted amendment to the applicable statute, a change made and enacted
into the applicable Income Tax Rules, or a binding Notification or Circular
issued by the Indian Income Tax Department regarding the application of Indian
Tax Law to transfers similar to the Transactions (which amendment to such
statute is enacted, change in such applicable Income Tax Rules is made and
enacted, or Notification or Circular is issued, in each case, after the date
hereof), with respect to Stockholder Taxes applicable to the Transactions
either (A) no Stockholder Taxes are due under applicable Law or (B) the Parent
Indemnified Parties are not liable for any unpaid Stockholder Taxes under
applicable Law; and (iv) unless the AAR Proceeding, an Alternative Resolution
Process or any Tax Proceeding relating to Stockholder Taxes with respect to
the Transactions is ongoing or is not yet complete at such time as this clause
(iv) would otherwise apply (it being agreed and understood that the
AAR Proceeding shall not be considered to be ongoing and shall not be
considered to be incomplete if an AAR Ruling has not then been obtained and an
Indian Tax Advisor provides to Parent formal written advice reasonably
acceptable to Parent at such time to the effect that there is no reasonable
prospect of obtaining an AAR Ruling and otherwise an AAR Proceeding shall be
considered to be ongoing and shall be considered to be incomplete), (A) if a
Governmental 

 



61  Entity does not commence a Tax Proceeding or assert a claim in respect of
Stockholder Taxes with respect to the Transactions before the forty-two (42)
month anniversary of the Closing Date, one-half of both the Stockholder Tax
Holdback Amount and the Stockholder Tax Special Fund shall be released
pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.04(e) _within three (3) Business Days of
such date and (B) if a Governmental Entity does not commence a Tax Proceeding
or assert a claim in respect of Stockholder Taxes with respect to the
Transactions before the sixty (60) month anniversary of the Closing Date, the
remaining balance of both the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and the
Stockholder Tax Special Fund shall be released pursuant to the terms of
_Section 8.04(e)_ within three (3) Business Days of such date.

(c) If there is an amendment to the applicable statute enacted, change made
and enacted into the applicable Income Tax Rules, or a binding Notification
or Circular issued by the Indian Income Tax Department, in each case, after
the date hereof, and on the basis of such statutory amendment or binding
Notification or Circular, an Indian Tax Advisor provides an opinion to Parent
at a "should" or greater level of comfort reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to Parent that the rate of Tax applicable to Stockholder Taxes is
less than twenty percent (20%), the product of (i) the quotient of (x) twenty
percent (20%) minus the rate of Tax applicable to Stockholder Taxes and (y)
twenty percent (20%) and (ii) the current balance of each of (x) the
Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and (y) the Stockholder Tax Special Fund
shall be released from the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and the Stockholder
Tax Special Fund, respectively, pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.04(e)_.

 

(d) Subject to the last sentence of Section 8.04(e), if there is a final and
binding determination by an Indian court that Stockholder Taxes are due or
are not due or if a final and binding settlement agreement has been entered
into by the Representative with the applicable Indian Governmental Entity with
respect to Stockholder Taxes or if Stockholder Taxes are otherwise due
or required to be paid, if (i) the amount of the Stockholder Taxes are less
than or equal to the then current balance of the Stockholder Tax Holdback
Amount, (x) Parent shall release from the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount an
amount equal to the amount of such payable Stockholder Taxes and shall pay
such amount to the applicable Indian Governmental Entity on behalf of the
Securityholders and Parent, and, in the case of such a court determination or
settlement that relates to the Transactions, Parent shall release the
remaining balance of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount pursuant to the terms
of _Section 8.04(e)_, and (y) in the case of such a court determination or
settlement that relates to the Transactions, the Representative shall release
the then current balance of the Stockholder Tax Special Fund pursuant to the
terms of _Section 8.04(e)_, or (ii) the amount of the Stockholder Taxes are
greater than the then current balance of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount
but less than the sum of the then current balance of the Stockholder Tax
Holdback Amount and the Stockholder Tax Special Fund, (x) Parent shall release
the entire balance of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and shall pay such
amount to the applicable Indian Governmental Entity on behalf of the
Securityholders and Parent, and (y) the Representative shall release the
balance of the Stockholder Tax from the Stockholder Tax Special Fund and
shall pay such amount to the applicable Indian Governmental Entity on behalf
of the Securityholders and Parent, and, in the case of such a court
determination or settlement that relates to the Transactions, the
Representative shall release the remaining balance of the Stockholder Tax
Special Fund pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.04(e)_, or (iii) the amount
of the Stockholder Taxes are greater than the sum of the then current balance
of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and the Stockholder

 



62  Tax Special Fund, (x) Parent shall release the entire amount of the
Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and shall pay such amount to the applicable
Indian Governmental Entity on behalf of the Securityholders and Parent (y)
the Representative shall release the entire amount of the Stockholder Tax
Special Fund and shall pay such amount to the applicable Indian Governmental
Entity on behalf of the Securityholders and Parent, and (z) the
Securityholders will pay, and the Representative will cause the
Securityholders to pay, the balance of the Stockholder Taxes to the applicable
Indian Governmental Entity on behalf of the Securityholders and Parent in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 8.04_. Subject to the last
sentence of Section 8.04(e), all releases of the Stockholder Tax Holdback
Amount or the Stockholder Tax Special Fund to the Securityholders pursuant to
this  _Section 8.04(d)_ will occur one (1) year after the date of the final
and binding court determination or settlement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, such time required to resolve the amount of Taxes due) (except that in
the case (i) of a final and binding determination by the Supreme Court of
India or (ii) of a final and binding settlement agreement having been entered
into by the Representative with the applicable Indian Governmental Entity and
an Indian Tax Advisor having provided an opinion to Parent at a "should" or
greater level of comfort reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
Parent that such settlement is final, binding, and not appealable by any
Indian Governmental Entity, such releases shall be made within three (3)
Business Days of the date of such court determination or settlement agreement)
provided, that in the event that a court determination or a settlement
agreement would otherwise give rise to a release to the Securityholders
hereunder, such release shall not so occur if the court determination or
settlement agreement is appealed or otherwise formally challenged after the
date of such court determination or settlement agreement by an
applicable Indian Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the above
provisions of this _Section 8.04(d)_, (A) Parent shall not be required to pay
over any amounts to the applicable Indian Governmental Entity if Parent or any
of its Affiliates has at such time already paid such amounts to the Indian
Governmental Entity nor shall Parent be required to pay over to the Indian
Governmental Entity or otherwise release any amounts in respect of costs and
expenses incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates to the extent
indemnifiable pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of Stockholder Taxes
and (B) for the absence of doubt, notwithstanding any other provision no costs
or expenses incurred by the Representative or the Securityholders shall be
paid by or from the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount or the Stockholder Tax
Special Fund (whether such costs or expenses are incurred in the name of
Parent or any of its Affiliates or otherwise) and the Representative and
the Securityholders shall be responsible for all such costs and expenses.

(e) Subject to receipt by Parent of the certificates described in the
following sentence, upon any release of any portion of the Stockholder Tax
Holdback Amount or Stockholder Tax Special Fund to the Securityholders,
subject to _Section 7.01(e)_, the Surviving Company or the Representative,
respectively, shall (A) deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the Common Stockholders and Preferred Stockholders
in respect of the shares of Company Stock held by them as of the Reference
Time (other than Dissenting Shares), an amount equal to the product of (1)
the amount of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount or Stockholder Tax Special
Fund to be released and distributed multiplied by (2) the Stockholder
Percentage, and the Exchange Agent shall distribute to each such Common
Stockholder and Preferred Stockholder its Pro Rata Stock Percentage of the
portion of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount or Stockholder Tax Special Fund
so distributed, and (B) pay to, or (in the case of the Representative deliver
or cause to be delivered to) the Surviving Company for the benefit of, holders
of In-the-Money Options and Restricted Stock Units in 

 



63  respect of In-the-Money Options and Restricted Stock Units held by them as
of the Reference Time, an amount equal to the product of (1) the portion of
the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount or Stockholder Tax Special Fund to be
released and distributed, multiplied by (2) the Award Holder Percentage, less
the aggregate applicable Forfeited Amounts, and the Surviving Company shall
distribute to each such holder of such In-the-Money Options and Restricted
Stock Units its Pro Rata Award Percentage of the portion of the Stockholder
Tax Holdback Amount or Stockholder Tax Special Fund so distributed (less any
applicable Forfeited Amounts) through the Surviving Companys payroll system
on the next normal payroll date of the Surviving Company. Prior to
each release of any portion of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount or
Stockholder Tax Special Fund to the Securityholders to a Major Holder, such
Major Holder shall deliver to Parent a certificate of an authorized officer of
such Major Holder or, in the case the Major Holder is a natural person, of
the Major Holder, stating that (x) such Major Holder acknowledges its
indemnification obligations pursuant to this _Section 8.04_ and (y) as of the
date of such certificate, such Major Holder has the financial capacity to
promptly comply with such indemnification obligations; _provided_ , for the
avoidance of doubt, that the failure of a Major Holder to deliver Parent the
certificate described in this  _Section 8.04(e)_ shall prohibit the release
of any portion of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount or Stockholder Tax
Special Fund to such Major Holders but shall not delay the release of any
portion of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount or Stockholder Tax Special
Fund to any other Major Holder.

(f)

 

(i) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, the Representative
shall file an application with the Authority for Advance Rulings (Income Tax)
for an advance ruling (the " _AAR Ruling_ ") confirming that no Stockholder
Taxes are due with respect to the Transactions. The Representative shall
pursue the AAR Ruling in good faith and shall act with the purpose of
obtaining a commercially reasonable AAR Ruling as promptly as reasonably
possible, and shall not abandon the AAR Proceeding or seek any other ruling or
(except for final and binding settlements or compromises of the AAR Proceeding
with the Indian Income Tax Department that would be permitted under clause
(E) below or, in accordance with and subject to the final sentence of this
subsection (f)(i), any Tax Proceeding initiated solely by an Indian
Governmental Entity) resolution of whether or what amount of Stockholder
Taxes are due with respect to the Transactions; _provided_ , however, the
Representative (I) shall be permitted to seek any other such legitimate,
binding and final rulings or resolutions (each, an " _Alternative Resolution
Process_ ") (A) if an Indian Tax Advisor has provided to Parent an opinion at
a "should" or greater level of comfort reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to Parent that any such Alternative Resolution Process should not
materially delay, impede, hinder, or otherwise adversely affect the AAR
Proceeding or (B) otherwise with the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (II)
shall be permitted to pursue obtaining an insurance policy with respect to the
Stockholder Taxes consistent with the provisions of _Section 8.04(b)(i)_. The
Representative shall take no position inconsistent with the Authority for
Advance Rulings (Income Tax) having jurisdiction and authority to issue the
AAR Ruling. Subject to the above provisions of this _Section 8.04(f)(i)_, the
second sentence of _Section 8.04(f)(ii)_, and the Representatives
obligations under the provisions of Section 8.04(i), the Representative shall
have the exclusive right to control the AAR Proceeding and any

 



64  other Tax Proceeding relating to Stockholder Taxes with respect to the
Transactions (including any Tax Proceeding relating to Stockholder Taxes with
respect to the Transactions and initiated by an Indian Governmental Entity);
_provided_ , that (I)(A) the Representative shall provide Parent with a timely
and reasonably detailed account of each phase of the AAR Proceeding (and any
other such Tax Proceeding), (B) the Representative shall consult with Parent
before taking any significant action in connection with the AAR Proceeding (or
any other such Tax Proceeding), (C) the Representative shall consult with
Parent and offer Parent an opportunity to comment before submitting any
written materials prepared or furnished in connection with the AAR Proceeding
(or any other such Tax Proceeding) and consider such comments in good faith,
(D) the Representative shall promptly provide Parent copies of any
written materials received or submitted in connection with the AAR Proceeding
(or any other such Tax Proceeding), and (E) the Representative shall not
settle or compromise the AAR Proceeding (or any other such Tax Proceeding) if
(1) the amount of such settlement or compromise (together with any settlement
or compromise of or claims made in respect of Stockholder Taxes relating to
the 2012 Restructuring or the Aditi Acquisition) exceeds the combined balance
of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and the Stockholder Tax Special Fund
at the time of the settlement or compromise, increased by the combined balance
of one or more escrow accounts (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
deposits with, and advance payments to, an applicable Indian Governmental
Entity to the extent the source of such deposits or advance payments one or
more the Major Holders (and not the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount or the
Stockholder Tax Special Fund) and that such deposits or advance
payments actually reduce the amount due and payable to the applicable Indian
Governmental Entity as a result of such settlement or compromise) established
by the Representative with respect to which funds are to be released in
connection with such settlement pursuant to agreements with Parent or the
applicable Indian Governmental Entity (or to which Parent or an Indian
Governmental Entity is a party or a third party beneficiary) that are no less
favorable to Parent or the applicable Indian Governmental Entity, as
applicable, with respect to such escrow funds as Parents rights hereunder,
under the Escrow Agreements, and under the Stockholder Agreements with respect
to the Stockholder Tax Special Fund or (2) such settlement or
compromise would bind Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to future
business pursuits or payments of Taxes (other than Stockholder Taxes with
respect to the Transactions) or otherwise impact the dealings of Parent or any
of its Affiliates with Indian Governmental Authorities in a material respect,
in each case, without obtaining the prior written consent of Parent (provided,
for the avoidance of doubt, the reference to Taxes in this clause (2) is not
intended to expand the scope of or otherwise impact the obligation of the
Securityholders to indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties
for Excluded Taxes pursuant to _Section 8.03_); _provided_ , that in the case
of a settlement with respect to which Parents consent is required solely
pursuant to the foregoing clause (1), if the Representative has established
one or more escrow accounts with respect to which funds are to be released in
connection with such settlement pursuant to agreements with Parent (or to
which Parent is a party or a third party beneficiary) that are no less
favorable to Parent, as applicable, with respect to such escrow funds as
Parents rights hereunder, under the Escrow Agreements, and under
the Stockholder Agreement with respect to the Stockholder Tax Special Fund
and such escrow accounts contain an amount greater than

 



65  or equal to their Pro Rata Indemnification Percentage of the excess of the
amount of such settlement over the combined balance of the Stockholder Tax
Holdback Amount and the Stockholder Tax Special Fund at the time of the
settlement, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(ii) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of its Affiliates receives an
inquiry from a Governmental Entity or Tax Claim with respect to Stockholder
Taxes, such party promptly shall provide written notice thereof, along with a
copy of all written communication, to the Representative; _provided_ , that
any failure to give such notice shall not affect the Parent Indemnified
Parties rights to indemnification or otherwise hereunder, except to the
extent that the Representative is materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure to give notice. If the Representative receives an inquiry from a
Governmental Entity or Tax Claim with respect to Stockholder Taxes, the
Representative promptly shall provide written notice thereof, along with a
copy of all written communication, to Parent.

(iii) The Representative shall defend against any Tax Proceeding relating to
Stockholder Taxes with respect to the 2012 Restructuring or the Aditi
Acquisition in good faith and shall not abandon any such Tax Proceeding and
shall comply with all deadlines imposed in connection with any Tax
Proceeding. Subject to the above provisions of this _Section 8.04(f)(iii)_
the second sentence of _Section 8.04(f)(ii)_, and the Representatives
obligations under the provisions of Section 8.04(i) the Representative shall
have the exclusive right to control any such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (I)(A) the Representative shall provide Parent with a timely
and reasonably detailed account of each phase of such Tax Proceeding, (B) the
Representative shall consult with Parent before taking any action in
connection with any such Tax Proceeding, (C) the Representative shall consult
with Parent and offer Parent an opportunity to comment before submitting any
written materials prepared or furnished in connection with any such Tax
Proceeding and consider such comments in good faith, (D) the Representative
shall promptly provide Parent copies of any written materials received or
submitted in connection with any such Tax Proceeding, and (E) the
Representative shall not settle or compromise any such Tax Proceeding if (1)
the amount of such settlement or compromise (together with any settlement or
compromise of or claims made in respect of other Stockholder Taxes) exceeds
the combined balance of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and the
Stockholder Tax Special Fund at the time of the settlement or compromise,
increased by the combined balance of one or more escrow accounts (including,
for the avoidance of doubt with, deposits and advance payments to, an
applicable Indian Governmental Entity to the extent the source of such
deposits or advance payments is one or more Major Holders (and not the
Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount or the Stockholder Tax Special Fund) and that
such deposits or advance payments actually reduce the amount due and payable
to the applicable Indian Governmental Entity as a result of such settlement or
compromise) established by the Representative with respect to which funds are
to be released in connection with such settlement pursuant to agreements with
Parent or the applicable Indian Governmental Entity (or to which Parent or an
Indian Governmental Entity is a party or a third party beneficiary) that are
no less favorable to Parent or the applicable Indian Governmental Entity, as
applicable, with respect to such escrow funds as Parents rights hereunder,

 



66  under the Escrow Agreements, and under the Stockholder Agreement with
respect to the Stockholder Tax Special Fund or (2) such settlement or
compromise would bind Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to future
business pursuits or payments of Taxes (other than Stockholder Taxes with
respect to the 2012 Restructuring or the Aditi Acquisition, respectively) or
otherwise impact the dealings of Parent or any of its Affiliates with Indian
Governmental Authorities in a material respect, in each case, without
obtaining the prior written consent of Parent (provided, for the avoidance of
doubt, the reference to Taxes in this clause (2) is not intended to expand the
scope of or otherwise impact the obligation of the Securityholders to
indemnify and hold harmless the Parent Indemnified Parties for Excluded Taxes
pursuant to Section 8.03); _provided_ , that in the case of a settlement with
respect to which Parents consent is required solely pursuant to the
foregoing clause (1), if the Representative has established one or more escrow
accounts with respect to which funds are to be released in connection with
such settlement pursuant to agreements with Parent (or to which Parent is a
party or a third party beneficiary) that are no less favorable to Parent, as
applicable, with respect to such escrow funds as Parents rights hereunder,
under the Escrow Agreements, and under the Stockholder Agreements with
respect to the Stockholder Tax Special Fund and such escrow accounts contain
an amount greater than or equal to their Pro Rata Indemnification Percentage
of the excess of the amount of such settlement over the combined balance of
the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and the Stockholder Tax Special Fund at
the time of the settlement, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(iv) Except as provided in _Section 8.04(g)_, claims for indemnification with
respect to Stockholder Taxes shall be governed exclusively by this _Section
8.04_ and the Stockholder Agreements, and the provisions of _Article X_
(including any limitation on any indemnification obligation) shall not apply
with respect to Stockholder Taxes.

 

(v) If in connection with any Tax Proceeding with respect to Stockholder
Taxes, a Governmental Entity requires that any Person provide a deposit with
respect to Stockholder Taxes or otherwise prepay Stockholder Taxes, the source
of recovery in respect of such Stockholder Taxes shall be the Stockholder Tax
Holdback Amount and second, the Stockholder Tax Special Fund and third, the
Major Holders severally, in accordance with their Pro Rata Indemnification
Percentages. If the amount of the Tax Claim is subsequently reduced or the Tax
Proceeding is resolved (in each case, in a manner that is final and binding)
for an amount of Stockholder Taxes that is less than the amount of the
deposit or prepayment, any refund received from the relevant Governmental
Entity with respect to such deposit or prepayment shall be released in a
manner consistent with the provisions of this _Section 8.04_ applicable to
the type of resolution applicable to such Stockholder Taxes and pursuant to
the terms of Section 8.04(e); _provided_ , that the portion of such refund
attributable to amounts directly contributed by the Major Holders in
accordance with this _Section 8.04(f)(v)_ (and the source of recovery of
which is not the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount or the Stockholder Tax
Special Fund) shall be released to the Major Holders within three (3)
Business Days of the applicable Persons receipt of such refund. Any such
refund not so distributed pursuant to the terms of the proviso in the
preceding sentence shall be retained by Parent and considered to be part
of the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount.

 



67 (g) The right of the Parent Indemnified Parties to indemnification under 
_Section 8.04(a)_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in the manner set forth in the proviso set forth in
_Section 10.02(c)_.

 

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision, (i) in the event that a Tax Claim has
been made by an Indian Governmental Authority relating to the 2012
Restructuring or the Aditi Acquisition at or prior to the time that an amount
would otherwise be released to the Securityholders under the provisions of
this _Section 8.04_, the amount that would otherwise be so released to
the Securityholders shall be reduced by the amount of such Tax Claim;
_provided_ , that upon a final and binding determination by an Indian court in
respect of Stockholder Taxes relating to the 2012 Restructuring or the Aditi
Acquisition or a final and binding settlement with the applicable Indian
Governmental Entity with respect to Stockholder Taxes relating to the 2012
Restructuring or the Aditi Acquisition or if Stockholder Taxes relating to the
2012 Restructuring or the Aditi Acquisition are otherwise due or required to
be paid, the amounts withheld under the above provisions of this _Section
8.04(h)_ shall be released in a manner consistent with _Section 8.04(d)_
(treating, for this purpose, references therein to the Transactions as
references instead to the 2012 Restructuring or the Aditi Acquisition, as
applicable) and (ii) in the event that the Representative has obtained
insurance as described in _Section 8.04(b)(i)_, (A) if such insurance is
obtained before the date of payment of the Additional Consideration or the
Earn-Out, respectively, the amount of the insurance premium (the " _Premium
Amount_ ") shall be set off against the Additional Consideration or the Earn-
Out (including the Unpaid Aditi Earn-Out, if applicable), as applicable and
(B) the amount that would otherwise be released to the Securityholders
pursuant to _Section 8.04(b)(i)_ or under _Article X_ shall be reduced by the
amount of such premium and shall instead be released to Parent. By way of
illustration only, if after the date of payment of the Additional
Consideration and the date the Adjusted Earn-Out Amount is reduced to zero,
the Representative obtains an insurance policy reasonably satisfactory to
Parent with a $20,000,000 face amount (i.e., there is a $15,000,000 layer of
insurance coverage after satisfaction of the deductible), a $5,000,000
deductible, and a $6,000,000 Premium Amount, and there are $10,000,000 in
claims made or pending against the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and the
Stockholder Tax Special Fund, then $9,000,000 ( _i.e._ , the covered amount of
$15,000,000 less the Premium Amount) would be released to the Securityholders
from the Stockholder Tax Holdback Amount and the Stockholder Tax Special Fund
in accordance with _Section 8.04(e)_, and $6,000,000 would be released to
Parent for payment of the Premium Amount.

(i) Parent, the Surviving Company and the Representative shall cooperate with
one another in connection with the AAR Proceeding, the Alternative Resolution
Process, obtaining any insurance policy in respect of Stockholder Taxes, and
any other Tax Proceeding in respect of Stockholder Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the furnishing or making available of employees on a mutually
convenient basis and records, books of account or other materials necessary or
helpful for the defense against assertions of any Governmental Entity as to
any Tax Proceeding in respect of Stockholder Taxes. In the event the Surviving
Company, Parent or any of its Affiliates, is a party to the AAR Proceeding,
the Alternative Resolution Process, and any other Tax Proceeding in respect
of Stockholder Taxes, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and
its Affiliates to, execute any document reasonably requested by the
Representative authorizing the Representative to communicate with the relevant
Governmental Entity in respect of such matters, subject to the other
limitations contained in this _Section 8.04_, and provided that,

 



68  for the avoidance of doubt, such documents shall not permit the
Representative to bind Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Company and its Affiliates) or receive any payments on their
behalf.

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision, any amount that would otherwise be
released to the Securityholders under the above provisions of this _Section
8.04_ in connection with an Alternate Resolution Process shall not be so
released unless an Indian Tax Advisor provides an opinion to Parent at the
time of such release at a "should" or greater level of comfort reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to Parent to the effect that such
resolution is final, binding, and not appealable by any Indian Governmental
Entity (or if, under the above provisions of this _Section 8.04_, a
requirement to wait one year for release to Securityholders after such
resolution has become final and binding (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, such time required to resolve the amount of Taxes due) has applied,
then to the effect that such resolution is final and binding).

Parent, in such capacity, the " _Responsible Party_ "),

 



74  written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of any matter which such Indemnified
Party has determined has given rise to a right of indemnification under
_Section 10.02_, promptly, but in any event within thirty (30) days of such
determination, and such Claim Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
representation(s), warranty(ies) or covenant(s) of this Agreement alleged to
have been untrue or incorrect or breached, and to the extent known, the
circumstances giving rise to the claimed Losses, and specify the Indemnified
Partys good faith estimate of the amount of the claimed Losses; _provided_
that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure. If the Responsible Party has disputed a
claim for indemnification under  _Section 10.02_ (including any Third Party
Claim) or has not notified the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days from
its receipt of the Claim Notice that the Responsible Party disputes or does
not dispute such claim, the Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party shall
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute. If the
Responsible Party and the Indemnified Party cannot resolve such dispute in

resolved pursuant to the terms of _Sections 13.10_, _13.14_ and _13.15_.

(b) If an Action by a third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is made against
any Indemnified Party, and if such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity
with respect thereto under _Section 10.02_, such Indemnified Party

the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Responsible Party is

assume, within twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice, the conduct and
control, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party at the
expense of the Responsible Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, by
sending notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; _provided_ that the
Responsible Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such
settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
borne by such Indemnified Party; and _provided_ _further_ , that the

expense of the Responsible Party) in the event the Responsible Party is not
timely and diligently pursuing such defense. Notwithstanding an election by
the Responsible Party to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate co-counsel and to
participate in the defense as counsel of record, if applicable, in such
action or proceeding (and the parties shall jointly control the defense), and
the Responsible Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of
such separate counsel if (i) there exists any actual or reasonably likely
conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Responsible Party
in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim that would make
representation by the same counsel or the counsel selected by the Responsible
Party inappropriate, (ii) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (iii) such Third Party Claim
is related to or otherwise arises in connection with any criminal or
regulatory enforcement Action, (iv) the amount at issue in the Third Party
Claim exceeds the Parent Cap, where a Parent Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnification, or the Company Cap, where a Company Indemnified Party is
seeking indemnification, minus the sum of any amounts actually paid to all
Parent Indemnified Parties or all Company Indemnified Parties, respectively,
pursuant to this _Article X_ or (v) the resolution of the Third Party Claim
would reasonably be expected to affect in any material respect the operations
or business of the Parent Indemnified Parties, or the Company Indemnified
Parties, as applicable.

 



75 (c) The Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Responsible Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any
such Third Party Claim without the consent of the Responsible Party if such
Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the
Responsible Party for such Third Party Claim. The Responsible Party shall not,
except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement of
a Third Party Claim that (i) does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the Person or Persons asserting such Third Party Claim
to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release from all Liability with
respect to such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment, (ii)
does not involve only the payment of money damages, (iii) imposes an
injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party, (iv) includes
any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by the Indemnified Party or (v)
involves the payment of money damages in excess of the remaining portion of
the Holdback Amount or Escrow Amount, as applicable.

 

(d) Any Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Responsible Party and its attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense
of any Third Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access
during normal business hours afforded to the Responsible Party and its agents
and representatives to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of,
records and information which have been identified by the Responsible Party
as being reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Parties shall cooperate
with each other in any notifications to insurers.

same or substantially related events, facts, developments or claims) for
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ that are of an amount
less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000).

(b) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover Losses
pursuant to  _Section 10.02(a)(i)_ until the total amount which the Parent

Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Losses
including the Parent Basket, subject to the proviso in _Section 10.02(a)_.

respect of any indemnification claim made by any Parent Indemnified Party

against any Additional Consideration. After the Escrow Amount is funded, the
initial source of recovery in respect of any indemnification claim made by any

8.03(b)_ shall be the Holdback Amount, in respect of claims made on or prior

of claims made after the date of funding of the Escrow Amount (in which event
Parent and the Representative shall cause the applicable Parent Authorized
Person and Representative Authorized Person, respectively, promptly to deliver
to the Escrow Agent a Joint Written Direction providing for the release of the
relevant funds to the applicable Parent Indemnified Parties). If the
Holdback Amount and the Escrow Amount are exhausted, and until the Adjusted

paid, the next source of recovery in respect of any indemnification claim
made by any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)_ and
_Section 8.03(b)_ shall be by set-off against any Earn-Out Amount (including
the Unpaid Aditi Earn-Out Amount, if any). If the Holdback Amount and the
Escrow Amount are exhausted, and following the earlier of the time that (i)
the Adjusted Earn-Out Amount shall be equal to or reduced to zero, by virtue
of set-off pursuant to this _Section 10.04(c)_ or otherwise, or (ii) the
Adjusted Earn-Out Amount, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 1.07(c)_, has
been paid, the sole source of recovery in respect of any indemnification claim
made by any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)_ and
_Section 8.03(b)_ shall be against the Major Holders, severally, in
accordance with their Pro Rata Indemnification Percentages.

 

(d) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under this _Article X_
shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds or any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by the indemnitee from
any third party with respect thereto (net of any costs incurred in connection
with such recovery), and the applicable Parent Indemnified Party claiming
such Loss shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek such payments.

(e) Each Parent Indemnified Party shall take commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any of its Losses for which indemnification would be sought
hereunder upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected

breach), the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement (other than the Companys representations and warranties in
_Sections 3.08(a)(iii)_ and _3.11(a)_ ) shall be read without reference to
the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" and other similar
qualifications as to materiality contained in such representations and
warranties.

 

(g) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Article X_ with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss to the extent
such Loss or alleged Loss is actually included as a Liability in the
calculation of the Debt or Net Working Capital.

 



77 (h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing in
this  _Section 10.04_ shall limit any Persons rights to recovery in respect
of Fraud against (1) any Securityholder, other than the perpetrator of the
Fraud, subject to such Securityholders Pro Rata Indemnification Percentage
of the cap set forth in _Section 10.02(a)(y)_, and (2) the perpetrator of
the Fraud, in any respect.

Section 10.05  _Limitations on Parent Indemnification Obligations_. The
rights of the Company Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 10.02_ are subject to the following limitations,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

indemnification in respect of any individual claim (or series of related
claims arising from the same or substantially related events, facts,
developments or claims) for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section
10.02(b)(i)_ that are of an amount less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000).

(b) The Company Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover
Losses pursuant to _Section 10.02(b)(i)_ until the total amount which the
Parent Indemnified Parties would recover under _Section 10.02(b)(i)_ but for
this _Section 10.05(b)_, exceeds $5,500,000 (five million five
hundred thousand dollars) (the " _Company Basket_ "), whereupon the Company
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Losses
including the Company Basket, subject to the proviso in _Section 10.02(b)_.

 

(c) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under this _Article X_
shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds or any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by the indemnitee from
any third party with respect thereto, and the applicable Company Indemnified
Party claiming such Loss shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
such payments.

(d) Each Company Indemnified Party shall take commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any of its Losses for which indemnification would be sought

breach), the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub contained
in this Agreement shall be read without reference to the terms "material" or

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, nothing in this
_Section 10.05_ shall limit any Persons rights to recovery in respect of
Fraud against (1) any Person other than the perpetrator of the Fraud, up to an
amount equal to the aggregate consideration paid to the Securityholders
pursuant to this Agreement and the Rollover Agreements and (2) the
perpetrator of the Fraud, in any respect.

provided in _Section 10.04(h)_ and _10.05(f)_ ) and other than with respect
to _Section 8.04_, following the Closing the indemnification provided by this
_Article X_ and _Section 8.03_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Parent Indemnified Parties and the Company Indemnified Parties for any and
all claims arising under, out of, or related to this Agreement, or the sale
and purchase of the Company (excluding any breach of (a) any post-Closing
obligations under the Merger Agreement or (b) any of the ancillary documents
referred to herein, including the Rollover Agreements, the Stockholder

Section 13.04 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Representative without the prior written consent of the non-assigning Parties;
_provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may assign this Agreement to one or
more Affiliates of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or
Merger Sub of its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 13.05  _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof
is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words
or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration
of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

Section 13.06 _References_. The table of contents and the section and other
headings and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the exhibits hereto
are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the
Parties, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement or any exhibit hereto. All references to this Agreement herein
or in any of the Disclosure Schedules delivered by the Company to Parent in
connection with the execution of this Agreement (each, a " _Schedule_ "
and, collectively, the " _Disclosure Schedules_ ") shall be deemed to refer
to this entire Agreement, including all Disclosure Schedules. Any reference in
a particular Schedule of the Disclosure Schedules shall only be deemed to be
an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are contained in

 



106  the corresponding Section of the Agreement and (b) any other representations
and warranties of the Company that are contained in the Agreement, but only if
the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such representations and warranties would be readily apparent to
a reasonable person who has read that reference and such representations and
warranties, without independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding
the matter(s) so disclosed. All references to days (excluding Business Days)
or months shall be deemed references to calendar days or months. All
references to "$" shall be deemed references to United States dollars. Unless
the context otherwise requires, any reference to a "Section," "Exhibit,"
"Disclosure Schedule" or "Schedule" shall be deemed to refer to a section of
this Agreement, an exhibit to this Agreement or a schedule to this Agreement,
as applicable. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import referring to this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word
"including" or any variation thereof means "including, without limitation" and
shall not be construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the
specific or similar items or matters immediately following it. The word "or"
shall not be exclusive. Words in the singular shall be held to include the
plural and _vice versa_ and words of one gender shall be held to include the
other gender as the context requires. All pronouns and any variations thereof
refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter, single or plural, as the context
may require.

 

Section 13.07 _Construction_. The language in this Agreement is the language
the Parties chose to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Person. The specification of any
dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules
or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended to imply that the amounts, or
higher or lower amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are
not required to be disclosed (including whether such amounts or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within or outside
of the ordinary course of business, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described or included in this Agreement or in any Schedule or Exhibit is
or is not required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside of
the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The
information contained in this Agreement and in the Disclosure Schedules and
Exhibits hereto is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by
any Party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any
violation of Law or breach of contract). The Company may, at its option,
include in the Disclosure Schedule any amounts or items that are not material
in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and any such inclusion, or
any references to amounts or items, shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or representation that such amounts or items are material, to
establish any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such
terms for purposes of this Agreement. In no event shall the inclusion of any
matter in the Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to broaden the
Companys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement.

 

Section 13.08 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedules hereto may be amended or waived only in a writing signed
(a) in the case of any amendment, by Parent, the Company (or the Surviving
Company following the

 



107  Closing) and the Representative and (b) in the case of a waiver, by the
Party or Parties waiving rights hereunder; _provided_ , that after the receipt
of the Stockholder Approval, no amendment to this Agreement shall be made
which by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without such further approval by such stockholders. No waiver of any provision
hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall extend to or affect in any
way any other provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

Section 13.09 _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents referred
to herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) and other documents
executed in connection herewith or at the Closing contain the complete
agreement between the Parties and supersede any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or between the Parties, written or oral,
which may have related to such subject matter in any way, including any data
room agreements, bid letters, term sheets, summary issues lists or other
agreements.

Section 13.10 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) IN ANY
WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES
HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED
HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY
AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED
BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE A
COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF
EACH PARTY HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

Section 13.11 _Delivery by Facsimile or Email_. This Agreement and any signed
agreement entered into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any
amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or scanned pages via electronic mail, shall be treated in
all manner and respects as an original contract and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No Party hereto or to any such contract shall
raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through
the use of facsimile machine or email as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense. This Agreement
is not binding unless and until signature pages are executed and delivered by
each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Representative.

Section 13.12  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one
(1) Party, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.

Section 13.13 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement
and the exhibits and schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State

 



108  of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law
rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 13.14 _Jurisdiction_. Any Action seeking to enforce any provision of,
or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware;
_provided_  that if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have
jurisdiction, any such Action shall be brought exclusively in any other
Delaware state court, or if the Court of Chancery and such other Delaware
state courts shall not have jurisdiction, in any federal court located in the
State of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such Action in any such court or that any such
Action which is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such Action may be served on any Party anywhere in the
world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.

 

Section 13.15 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party shall be deemed
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or
by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

Section 13.16 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges that
the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
are unique and recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching
Party may have no adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, the Parties agree that
prior to a valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with this
Agreement, such non-breaching Party shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in its favor at Law or in equity, to
enforce its rights and the other Partys obligations hereunder not only by an
Action or Actions for damages but also by an Action or Actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of
bond or other security). Each of the Parties agrees that it shall not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and hereby
waives (x) any defenses in any Action for an injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief, including the defense that the other Parties have
an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity and (y) any requirement
under Law to post a bond, undertaking or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

 

Section 13.17 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the Parent Indemnified
Parties and Company Indemnified Parties as provided herein, nothing expressed
or referred to in this Agreement shall be construed to give any Person other
than the Parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of
this Agreement, except (x) for the right of the Company on behalf of the
Securityholders to pursue damages (including claims for damages based on loss
of the economic

 



109  benefits of the Transactions, including _Sections 1.02_ and _1.03,_ to the
Securityholders) in the event the Effective Time has not occurred as a result
of Parents or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement (whether or not this
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Article XI_) and (y) after the
Effective Time, if Parent shall not have made payments in accordance with
_Sections 1.02_ and  _1.03_ , the Representative, on behalf of the
Securityholders, shall have the right to enforce directly the Securityholders
rights to receive the amounts payable pursuant to _Sections 1.02_ and _1.03_
, each of which rights set forth in clauses (x) and (y) hereof are hereby
expressly acknowledged and agreed to by the Parties, nothing herein, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of
employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 13.18  _Conflict of Interest_. If the Representative so desires,
acting on behalf of the Securityholders and without the need for any consent
or waiver by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company, Shearman and Sterling
LLP (" _Shearman_ ") shall be permitted to represent the Representative and
the Securityholders after the Closing in connection with any matter relating
to the Merger or the other Transactions. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, after the Closing, Shearman shall be permitted to represent
the Securityholders, any of their agents and Affiliates, or any one or more of
them, in connection with any negotiation or transaction with Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Company or any of their agents or Affiliates under
or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions, and any
related matter. Upon and after the Closing, the Company shall cease to have
any attorney-client relationship with Shearman, unless and to the extent
Shearman is specifically engaged in writing by the Company to represent the
Company after the Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict of
interest with respect to the Securityholders or the Representative consents in
writing at the time to such engagement. Any such representation of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Company by Shearman after the Closing shall not
affect the foregoing provisions hereof. Shearman shall be permitted to
withdraw from any representation of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Company in order to be able to represent or continue so representing the
Securityholders, even if such withdrawals causes Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Company additional legal expense (such as to bring new counsel "up
to speed"), delay or other prejudice. Following the Effective Time, except
with the consent of the Representative, neither Parent, the Company nor the
Surviving Company, nor any Person acting on behalf of or through Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Company, will seek to obtain or use the Privilege
Assets without the Representatives consent, provided that the Representative
shall not unreasonably withhold its consent if any such Person is seeking to
use such Privilege Assets in defense or prosecution of a claim brought by or
against a third party that is not a Securityholder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing shall prevent Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Company or any Person acting on behalf of or through any of them from
complying with applicable Law or court order. After the Closing, Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz (" _Wachtell_ ") shall be permitted to represent Parent
and the Surviving Company, any of their respective agents and Affiliates, or
any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation or transaction
with the Representative, the Securityholders or any of their agents or
Affiliates under or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
Transactions, and any related or unrelated matter. Any representation of any
Person by Wachtell shall not affect the immediately preceding sentence.

 



110 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement and Plan of
Merger on the day and year first above written.
