ARTICLE 2

MERGER

2.1 The Merger. Under the terms of this Agreement and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 7, at the
Effective Time, Citywide will be merged with and into Heartland. Heartland, in
its capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to
herein as the "Surviving Corporation." The Merger will be effected pursuant to
the provisions of, and with the effect provided in, Section 252 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and Section 7-111-106.5 of the
Colorado Business Corporation Act (the "CBCA").



2.2 Effect of Merger.



(a)At the Effective Time, Citywide will be merged with and into Heartland, and
the separate existence of Citywide will cease. The Charter and the Bylaws of
Heartland, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the
Charter and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until the same may be
amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable Law. The
directors and officers of Heartland immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and shall
qualify; provided, however, that Schmitz will be nominated by Heartland and
recommended to its shareholders for election to its Board of Directors in
accordance with Section 6.13.



(b)At the Effective Time and thereafter, the Surviving Corporation will be
responsible and liable for all the Liabilities, Indebtedness and penalties of
each of Heartland and Citywide.



(c)At the Effective Time and thereafter, the Surviving Corporation will
possess all the rights, privileges, immunities and franchises, of a public as
well as of a private nature, of each of Heartland and Citywide; all property,
real, personal and mixed, and all Indebtedness due on whatever account, and
all and every other interest, of or belonging to or due to each of Heartland
and Citywide, will be taken and deemed to be transferred to and vested in the
Surviving Corporation without further act or deed; and the title to any real
estate or any interest therein, vested in Heartland or Citywide, will not
revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the Merger.



(d)To effect the Merger, the parties hereto will cause a Certificate of Merger
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Delaware
Certificate of Merger") and a 

Statement of Merger substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C
(the "Colorado Statement of Merger") relating to the Merger to be filed with
the Secretary of State of Delaware and the Secretary of State of Colorado,
respectively. The Merger will become effective upon the filing of the Delaware
Certificate of Merger and the Colorado Statement of Merger. As used herein,
the term "Effective Date" will mean the date on which the Merger will become
effective as provided in the preceding sentence, and the term "Effective Time"
will mean the time on the Effective Date when the Merger will become
effective. The Effective Date and the Effective Time will take place on the
Closing Date.



2.3 Conversion of Citywide Common Stock.



(a)To effectuate the Merger, at the Effective Time, and without any further
action of Heartland, Citywide or any holder of Citywide Common Stock, each
issued and outstanding share of Citywide Common Stock (other than shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 2.3(c) and Dissenting Shares) will be canceled
and extinguished and be converted into and become a right to receive (i)
subject to Sections 2.4 and 6.15, $57.00 in cash (the "Cash Consideration"),
and (ii) subject to Section 2.5, 3.300 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of
Heartland Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration," and, together with the
Actual Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").



(b)No fractional shares of Heartland Common Stock will be issued for Citywide
Converted Common Shares, and in lieu of any fractional share, Heartland will
pay to each holder of Citywide Converted Common Shares who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share of Heartland Common Stock an amount of
cash (without interest) equal to the product of (i) the Heartland Closing Date
Stock Price multiplied by (ii) the fractional share interest to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled (the "Fractional Share Amount").



(c)Each share of Citywide Common Stock held as treasury stock of Citywide or
held directly or indirectly by Heartland, other than shares held in a
fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction of Indebtedness previously contracted,
will be canceled, retired and cease to exist, and no exchange or payment will
be made with respect thereto.



2.4Adjustment to Cash Consideration for Changes in Adjusted Tangible Common
Equity. If the Adjusted Tangible Common Equity is less than $113,000,000, the
Cash Consideration will be reduced by an amount equal to (a) the amount by
which the Adjusted Tangible Common Equity is below $113,000,000, divided by
(b) the Citywide Shares Outstanding (the "Downwardly Adjusted Cash
Consideration"). If the Adjusted Tangible Common Equity is greater than
$114,800,000, the Cash Consideration will be increased by an amount equal to
(x) the lesser of (A) $5,000,000 and (B) the amount by which the Adjusted
Tangible Common Equity is above $114,800,000, divided by (y) the Citywide
Shares Outstanding (the "Upwardly Adjusted Cash Consideration").



2.5 Adjustments to Heartland Common Stock. In the event Heartland changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of Heartland
Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date as a result of
any stock split, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
Heartland Common Stock, or Heartland declares a stock dividend or
extraordinary cash dividend, and the record date therefor will be prior to the
Effective Date, the Exchange Ratio will be proportionately adjusted.



2.6 Rights of Holders of Citywide Common Stock; Capital Stock of Heartland.



(a)At and after the Effective Time and until surrendered for exchange, each
outstanding stock certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented the Citywide Converted Common Shares will be deemed for all
purposes to evidence the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the
Actual Cash Consideration for each Citywide Converted Common Share, and the
record holder of such outstanding stock certificate will, after the Effective
Time, be entitled to vote the shares of Heartland Common Stock into which such
shares of Citywide Common Stock will have been converted on any matters on
which the holders of record of Heartland Common Stock, as of any date
subsequent to the Effective Time, will be entitled to vote. In any matters
relating to such stock certificates, Heartland may rely conclusively upon the
record of shareholders maintained by Citywide containing the names and
addresses of the holders of record of Citywide Common Stock at the Effective
Time.



(b)At and after the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Heartland
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain an
issued and existing share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and
will not be affected by the Merger.



2.7 Payment and Exchange of Certificates.



(a)Payment of Merger Consideration; Exchange of Certificates. Within five (5)
Business Days after the Closing, Heartland will cause to be distributed to
each holder of shares of Citywide Common Stock a letter of transmittal or
other appropriate materials to facilitate the surrender of certificates
representing such shares in exchange for the Stock Consideration and the
Actual Cash Consideration for each Citywide Converted Common Share (a "Letter
of Transmittal"). Within five (5) Business Days after surrender to Heartland
or to a paying agent appointed by Heartland of any certificate which prior to
the Effective Date represented a share of Citywide Common Stock, Heartland or
such paying agent will distribute to the Person in whose name such certificate
is registered, the Stock Consideration and the Actual Cash Consideration, and,
if applicable, cash in the amount of any Fractional Share Amount.



(b)Failure to Surrender Certificates. If outstanding certificates formerly
representing Citywide Converted Common Shares are not surrendered prior to the
date on which the Merger Consideration to which any holder of such shares is
entitled as a result of the Merger would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, the unclaimed Merger Consideration will,
to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable Law,
become the property of Heartland (and, to the extent not in Heartland's
possession, will be paid over to Heartland), free and clear of any and all
claims or interest of any Person except the holder of the Citywide Converted
Shares that have not been surrendered. Any former shareholder of Citywide who
has not theretofore complied with this Article 2 will thereafter look only to
Heartland with respect to the payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the
Heartland Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Citywide Common
Stock such shareholder holds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Heartland
nor any other Person will be liable to any former holder of Citywide Common
Stock for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws.



(c)Lost Certificates. In the event that any certificate representing Citywide
Converted Common Shares will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Heartland
will issue and pay in exchange 

for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in form reasonably satisfactory
to Heartland's paying agent, the Merger Consideration for each Citywide
Converted Common Share; provided, however, that Heartland or Heartland's
paying agent may, as a condition precedent to the issuance and payment of the
Merger Consideration to which the holder of such certificate is entitled as a
result of the Merger, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate to provide an indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Heartland, Citywide or any other party with respect to the certificate alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. Heartland or Heartland's paying agent
will not require such holder to deliver a bond or other security or collateral
with respect to such indemnity obligation.



(d)Dividends. Until outstanding certificates formerly representing Citywide
Converted Common Shares are surrendered as provided in Section 2.7(a) and (c),
no dividend or distribution payable to holders of record of shares of
Heartland Common Stock will be paid to any holder of such outstanding
certificates, but upon surrender of such outstanding certificates by such
holder, there will be paid to such holder the amount of any dividends or
distributions (without interest) theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of Heartland Common Stock, but not paid to such holder, and which
dividends or distributions had a record date occurring on or subsequent to the
Effective Time.



(e)Full Satisfaction. The Merger Consideration issued and paid upon the
surrender for exchange of each Citywide Converted Common Share in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Citywide
Converted Common Share.



2.8 Dissenting Shares.



(a)Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares
of Citywide Common Stock held by a Person (a "Dissenting Shareholder") who has
demanded and perfected a demand for payment of the fair value of his, her or
its shares of Citywide Common Stock in accordance with Section 7-113-101, et
seq., of the CBCA and, as of the Effective Time, has neither effectively
withdrawn nor lost his, her or its right to such demand will not represent a
right to receive Merger Consideration for any share of Citywide Common Stock
pursuant to Sections 2.3(a), 2.4 and 2.5, but in lieu thereof the holder
thereof will be entitled to only such rights as are granted by the CBCA.



(b)Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.8(a), if any Dissenting
Shareholder demanding payment of fair value of such Dissenting Shareholder's
shares of Citywide Common Stock ("Dissenting Shares") under CBCA will
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
Dissenting Shareholder's right to demand such payment, then, as of the
Effective Time or the time of such withdrawal or loss, whichever occurs later,
each Dissenting Share will automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Sections 2.3(a),
2.4 and 2.5 upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing
such Dissenting Shares.



(c)Citywide will give Heartland prompt notice of any demands by a Dissenting
Shareholder for payment of fair value of his, her or its shares of Citywide
Common Stock, or notices of intent to demand such payment received by Citywide
pursuant to Section 7-113-101, et seq. of the CBCA, and Heartland will have
the right, at its expense, to direct all negotiations and 

proceedings with respect to such demands. Citywide will not, except with the
prior written consent of Heartland (which will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or as otherwise required by Law, make any payment with
respect to, settle, or offer to settle, any such demands. Heartland will make
any payments, settlement and offers of settlements to Dissenting Shareholders
with respect to demands made pursuant to Section 7-113-101, et seq. of the
CBCA.



2.9 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Heartland located
at 1398 Central Avenue, Dubuque, Iowa, or at a location otherwise agreed upon
by Citywide and Heartland. The Closing will take place as soon as practicable
once the conditions in Article 7 have been satisfied or waived but in any
event within ten (10) Business Days after the date on which all such
conditions have been satisfied or waived, unless the parties otherwise agree
(the "Closing Date"). The failure of the Closing will not ipso facto result in
termination of this Agreement and will not relieve any party of any obligation
under this Agreement.

Citywide will deliver or make available to Heartland:

7.3(c);

which will be dated as of a date not earlier than 30 days prior to the

(x)a duly executed FIRPTA statement for purposes of satisfying Heartland's
obligations under Section 1.1445-2(c) of the Treasury Regulations; and

otherwise facilitating the consummation of the transactions contemplated by

Closing Date. Heartland has not received any indication from any Governmental
Authority that such Governmental Authority would oppose or refuse to grant or
issue its consent or approval, if required, with respect to the transactions

Governmental Authority required to approve the transactions contemplated
hereby would oppose or fail to grant its consent or approval to such

Subsidiaries may be liable or to which any of their respective properties or
assets may be subject before or by any Governmental Entity that, individually

applicable listing rules and corporate governance rules and regulations of
NASDAQ.



3.14 Community Reinvestment Act. Centennial had a rating of "satisfactory" or
better as of its most recent CRA examination, and Centennial has not received
written notice of any facts or circumstances exist that would reasonably be

bank holding companies or engaged in the insurance of bank deposits
(collectively, "Bank Regulators") of lower than "satisfactory."

the results of operations of Citywide and Citywide Banks for the periods then
ended.



(c)Citywide will make available to Heartland the payroll listings of each of
the Citywide Entities as of the end of each pay period after December 2016,

efforts to obtain (at no cost to Heartland) prior to Closing, all Consents
(the "Required Consents") necessary or reasonably desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the other
consents listed on Schedule 5.6. Citywide will keep Heartland reasonably
advised of the status of obtaining the Required Consents, and Heartland will
reasonably cooperate with Citywide to obtain the Required Consents, which will
include providing financial or other information about Heartland or Centennial
and executing and delivering any consent, assignment or other instrument
reasonably requested by any Person providing a Required Consent.



5.7 Tax Matters.

(a)Each of the Citywide Entities, at their own expense, will prepare and
timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) all Returns required to
be filed by the relevant Citywide Entity on or before the Effective Date, and
timely pay all Taxes reflected thereon. All such Returns will be correct and
complete in all material respects, and will be prepared in accordance with
past practice of Citywide to the extent such past practice complies with
applicable Law. No later than 30 days prior to the due date (including
extensions) for filing any income or franchise Tax Returns referred to in the
first sentence of this Section 5.7(a), the relevant Citywide Entity will
deliver such Returns to Heartland for its review and comment. With respect to
any Returns referred to in the first sentence of this Section 5.7(a) other
than income and franchise Tax Returns, the relevant Citywide Entity will
deliver such other Returns to Heartland no later than five days prior to the
due date (including extensions) for filing such Returns, and Heartland will
have the right to review and comment on such other Returns. Citywide and the
relevant Citywide Entity will consider the comments of Heartland in good faith
and will incorporate Heartland's comments in each such Return prior to filing
thereof to the extent Citywide deems necessary; provided, however, that
Citywide will make any changes to such Returns that are required to correct
obvious errors or to ensure that each Return complies with applicable Law.



(b)Heartland, at its own expense, will prepare and timely file (or cause to be
prepared and timely filed) all Returns of the Citywide Entities required to be
filed after the Effective Date. Heartland will prepare and file all such
Returns in respect of a taxable period which ends on or prior to the Effective
Date that are not required to be filed on or before the Effective Date, and
all such Tax Returns in respect of a taxable period which begins before and
ends after the Effective Date, consistent with past practices of the relevant
Citywide Entities, to the extent such practices comply with applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Heartland will not amend any
income Tax Return filed by or on behalf of any Citywide Entity for any Tax
period during which Citywide had in effect an election to be an "S
corporation" within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code if such
amendment would result in additional Tax Liability being imposed on any Person
that was a shareholder of Citywide during the relevant Tax period, unless
Heartland obtains such Person's prior written consent, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that no
such written consent will be required if the amendment of such Return is
required by a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code
or is otherwise required by Law.



(c)Citywide will be liable for any transfer, value added, excise, stock
transfer, stamp, recording, registration and any similar Taxes that become
payable in connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby ("Transfer Taxes"). The applicable parties will cooperate in preparing
and filing such forms and documents as may be necessary to permit any such
Transfer Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Effective Date in
accordance with any available pre‑sale filing procedure, and to obtain any
exemption from or refund of any such Transfer Tax.



(d)Each of the Citywide Entities and Heartland will cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
filing of Returns pursuant to this Section 5.7 and in connection with any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
will include the retention and (upon the other party's reasonable request) the
provision of records and information (including making such records and
information available for copying) which are reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding, the 

timely provision to the other party of powers of attorney or similar
authorizations necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 5.7, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Heartland and each of the Citywide Entities agrees to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to any of the Citywide Entities
relating to any taxable period which ends on or prior to the Effective Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Heartland or its Affiliate, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Governmental Entity.



5.8 No Solicitation.

(a)Neither Citywide nor any other Citywide Entity will, and they will each use
their best efforts to cause their officers, directors, employees agents and
authorized representatives ("Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the making, submission
or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or take any action that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any
information regarding any Citywide Entity to any Person in connection with or
in response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or indication of interest
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any
Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction;
provided, however, that prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Required Citywide Shareholder Vote, this Section 5.8(a) will not prohibit
Citywide from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Citywide Entities
to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person in response
to a Superior Proposal that is submitted to Citywide by such Person (and not
withdrawn) if (1) neither Citywide nor any other Citywide Entity nor any of
their respective Representatives have violated any of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 5.8(a), (2) the Board of Directors of Citywide concludes
in good faith, after having consulted with and considered the advice of
outside counsel to Citywide, that such action is required in order for the
Board of Directors of Citywide to comply with its fiduciary obligations to
Citywide's shareholders under applicable Law, (3) at least two business days
prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into
discussions with, such Person, Citywide gives Heartland written notice of the
identity of such Person and of Citywide's intention to furnish nonpublic
information to, or enter into discussions with, such Person, and Citywide
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and
oral information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Citywide and (4)
at least two business days prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information
to such Person, Citywide furnishes such nonpublic information to Heartland (to
the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by the
Citywide to Heartland). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Citywide acknowledges and agrees that any violation of or the taking of any
action inconsistent with any of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by Citywide, another Citywide Entity or any Representative will be
deemed to constitute a breach of this Section 5.8(a) by Citywide.



(b)Citywide will promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt
of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of interest that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information) advise Heartland orally 

and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or indication of
interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
or any request for nonpublic information relating to Citywide or any other
Citywide Entity (including the identity of the Person making or submitting
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request, and the
terms thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person prior to the Closing
Date. Citywide will keep Heartland fully informed with respect to the status
of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request
and any modification or proposed modification thereto.



(c)Citywide and any other Citywide Entity will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing discussions with any Person that relate to any
Acquisition Proposal.



(d)Citywide will not release or permit the release of any Person from, or
waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality,
"standstill" or similar agreement to which Citywide is a party, and will
enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request of
Heartland.



5.9 Heartland Forbearances. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or

Agreement, or (b) take, or omit to take, any action that is reasonably likely

such application, registration statement or other document and will discuss
with the other party which portions of this Agreement will be designated as
confidential portions of such applications. Each party will use all
commercially reasonable efforts and will cooperate with the other party in
taking any other actions necessary to obtain such regulatory or other
approvals and consents, including participating in any required hearings or
proceedings. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each party
will use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or

Recommendation may not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to
Heartland, and no resolution by the Board of Directors of Citywide or any
committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Citywide Board Recommendation in a

withdraw, qualify or modify the Citywide Board Recommendation or approve,
adopt, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal made
after the date hereof and not solicited, initiated or encouraged in breach of
Section 5.8 if the Board of Directors of Citywide determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be likely
to result in a breach of fiduciary duties under applicable law (a "Change of
Citywide Board Recommendation"). In determining whether to make a Change of
Citywide Board Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or otherwise,
the Board of Directors of Citywide will take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Heartland or any other information
provided by Heartland in response to such notice.

immediately prior to the Closing Date, Citywide Banks will, consistent with
GAAP, establish such additional accruals and reserves as Heartland indicates
are necessary to conform Citywide Banks's accounting and credit loss reserve
practices and methods to those of Heartland (as such practices and methods are
to be applied to Citywide Banks from and after the Effective Time) and reflect
Heartland's plans with respect to the conduct of the business of Citywide
Banks following the Merger and to provide for the costs and expenses relating
to the consummation by Citywide Banks of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that any such accruals and reserves will not
affect the determination of Adjusted Tangible Common Equity. No such accruals
or reserves will of itself constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation
or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or
other provision or constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement or be
an acknowledgment by Citywide (a) of any adverse circumstances for purposes of
determining whether the conditions to Heartland's obligations under this
Agreement have been satisfied or (b) that such adjustment has any bearing on
the Aggregate Merger Consideration. In no event will any accrual, reserve or
other adjustment required or permitted by this Section 6.4 require any prior
filing with any Governmental Entity or violate any Law, rule or order
applicable to Citywide or Citywide Banks.



6.5 Employee Matters.

(a)General. At the request of Heartland, Citywide agrees to terminate any
Plans as of the Effective Time on terms reasonably acceptable to Heartland. If
any Plans are not so terminated, after the Effective Time, Heartland will have
the right to continue, amend, merge or terminate any of such Plans in
accordance with the terms thereof and subject to any limitation arising under
applicable Law, including Tax qualification requirements. Citywide agrees
that, at the request of Heartland, Citywide, Citywide Banks and any Commonly
Controlled Entity will cease to be a participating employer of, and will cease
making contributions to or otherwise providing benefits under, any Plan, as of
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, there are any Plans for
which the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries continues to be a
participating employer, Heartland will have the right to discontinue such
participation in any of such Plans in accordance with the terms thereof and
subject to any limitation arising under applicable Law. Until Heartland will
take such action, however, such Plans will continue in force for the benefit
of present and former employees of any Citywide Entity who have any present or
future entitlement to benefits under any of the Plans ("Citywide Employees").



(b)Limitation on Enforcement. This Agreement is an agreement solely between
Citywide and Heartland. Except for the indemnification rights provided in
Section 6.8, nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.5, whether
express or implied, confers upon any Citywide Employees, employees of
Heartland and its Subsidiaries or any other Person, any rights or remedies,
including: (i) any right to employment or recall, (ii) any right to continued
employment for any specified period, or (iii) any right to any particular
compensation, benefit or aggregate of benefits, or any other term or condition
of employment, of any kind or nature whatsoever. After the Closing Date, each
Citywide Employee will be eligible to participate in the health, vacation and
other non-equity based employee benefit plans of Heartland or its Subsidiaries
(the "Heartland Plans") to the same extent as similarly situated employees of
Heartland and to the extent permitted by the applicable Heartland Plan or
applicable Law; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.5(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement will limit the right of Heartland or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend or terminate a Heartland Plan at any time. With respect
to the Heartland Plans, Heartland will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to: 

(A) with respect to each Heartland Plan that is a medical/prescription, dental
or vision plan, (x) waive any exclusions for pre-existing conditions under
such Heartland Plan that would result in a lack of coverage for any condition
for which the applicable Citywide Employee would have been entitled to
coverage under the corresponding Plan in which such Citywide Employee was an
active participant immediately prior to his or her transfer to Heartland Plan,
(y) waive any waiting period under such Heartland Plan, to the extent that
such period exceeds the corresponding waiting period under the corresponding
Plan in which such Citywide Employee was an active participant immediately
prior to his or her transfer to Heartland Plan (after taking into account the
service credit provided for herein for purposes of satisfying such waiting
period), and (z) provided the insurance company of any Citywide Entity
provides information related to the amount of such credit that is available to
Heartland, provide each Citywide Employee with credit for deductibles paid by
such Citywide Employee prior to his or her transfer to Heartland Plan (to the
same extent such credit was given under the analogous Plan prior to such
transfer) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under such Heartland Plan for the plan year that includes such
transfer and (B) fully recognize service of the Citywide Employees with any
Citywide Entity for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit,
and, solely with respect to vacation and severance benefits, benefit accrual
in any Heartland Plan in which the Citywide Employees are eligible to
participate after the Closing Date, to the extent that such service was
recognized for that purpose under the analogous Plan prior to such transfer.
Heartland will extend coverage to Citywide Employees for health care,
dependent care and limited purpose health care flexible spending accounts
established under Section 125 of the Code to the same extent as available to
similarly situated employees of Heartland to the extent permitted by such
Heartland Plans and applicable Law. Heartland will give effect to any
elections made by Citywide Employees with respect to such accounts under any
flexible benefits cafeteria plan of any Citywide Entity to the extent
permitted by such Heartland Plan and applicable Law. Citywide Employees will
be credited with amounts available for reimbursement equal to such amounts as
were credited under any flexible benefits cafeteria plan of any Citywide
Entity to the extent permitted by such Heartland Plan and applicable Law. The
foregoing will not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of
benefits.



(c)Terminated Citywide Employees. To the extent that Heartland terminates the
employment of any Citywide Employee without "cause" (as such term is
reasonably defined by Heartland) at, or within six months after, the Effective
Time, Heartland will offer such Citywide Employee severance benefits
approximately equivalent to one week of base compensation for each full year
of service to such Citywide Entity, with a minimum of two and a maximum of 12
weeks of severance pay on terms and conditions to be established in the
reasonable discretion of Heartland consistent with past practices.



(d)Employee Retention Program. Prior to the Effective Time, Citywide and
Heartland will mutually agree on and establish an employee retention bonus
program and will allocate pursuant to such program cash awards to certain
Citywide Banks employees, as mutually determined by Citywide and Heartland, in
order to incent such employees to remain in the employ of Citywide and its
Affiliates through the Closing Date. Any amounts allocated to or paid pursuant
to such program will constitute Transaction Expenses.



(e)Accrued Employee Bonuses. If, prior to the Effective Time, any Citywide
Entity has accrued amounts to be paid after the Effective Time as a bonus to
an employee of such Citywide Entity, Heartland will allocate and pay such
bonuses to the designated employees upon 

the earlier of (i) the applicable time for the payment of bonuses for the 2017
performance period, or (ii) such employee's termination as an employee of the
Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates.



(f)Affordable Care Act Reporting. As of the earlier of the Closing Date or the
applicable reporting deadline under the Affordable Care Act, Citywide,
Citywide Banks and each Commonly Controlled Entity will accurately complete
and timely file with the Internal Revenue service, and timely send to all
covered individuals, as applicable, any required IRS Forms 1094-B, 1095-B,
1094-C and 1095-C for the 2016 calendar year with respect to each Benefit Plan
that is subject to the Affordable Care Act.



6.6 Tax Treatment. None of any Citywide Entities or Heartland will take any
action which would disqualify the Merger as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



6.7 Updated Schedules. On a date 15 Business Days prior to the Effective Date
and on the Effective Date, Citywide will modify any Schedule to this Agreement
or add any Schedule or Schedules for the purpose of making the representations
and warranties to which any such Schedule relates true and correct in all
material respects as of such date, or with respect to any Schedule dated as of
a specific date, as of such specific date, whether to correct any misstatement
or omission in any Schedule or to reflect any additional information obtained
by Citywide subsequent to the date any Schedule was previously delivered by
Citywide to Heartland. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any updated Schedule
will not have the effect of making any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement true and correct in all material respects for purposes of
Section 7.3(a).



6.8 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a)Heartland agrees that all rights of the present and former directors,
officers and managers of any of the Citywide Entities to indemnification
provided for in the Charter or Bylaws or other governing documents of such
Citywide Entity, as applicable, as in effect on the date hereof, or required
under any applicable Law (including rights to advancement of expenses and
exculpation), will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect
until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (each such director
and officer being sometimes hereinafter be referred to as an "Indemnified
Party"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Heartland agrees
that, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will indemnify
any person made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that such
person was a director, officer, member or employee of any of the Citywide
Entities at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent provided in,
and will advance expenses in accordance with, the Charter, Bylaws and other
governing documents of the Citywide Entities, as applicable, in the form
previously provided to Heartland and effective as of the date of this
Agreement, in each case subject to all the limitations set forth in such
Charter, Bylaws or other governing documents and applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.8,
nothing contained in this Agreement will require Heartland to indemnify,
defend or hold harmless any Indemnified Party to a greater extent than any
Citywide Entity may, as of the date of this Agreement, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless such Indemnified Party, and any such indemnification provided
pursuant to this Section 6.8 will be provided only to the extent that such
indemnification is permitted by any applicable federal or state Laws.



(b)Prior to the Effective Time, Citywide will or, if Citywide is unable to,
Heartland as of the Effective Time will, obtain a "tail" insurance policy with
a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time
with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance 

and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the Indemnified
Parties as the existing policies of the Citywide Entities with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby). Heartland will pay the premium for such DandO Insurance tail policy;
provided, however, that in no event will Heartland be required to expend more
than 200% of the current amount expended on an annual basis by the Citywide
Entities to procure their existing DandO Insurance policies. If Citywide or
Heartland for any reason is unable to obtain such tail DandO Insurance policy on
or prior to the Effective Time, Heartland will obtain as much as comparable
DandO Insurance as is available at a cost in the aggregate for such six-year
period up to 200% of the current annual premiums expended by the Citywide
Entities for their existing DandO Insurance policies. Any insurance premium
payments made by Heartland pursuant to this Section 6.8(b) will be considered
Transaction Expenses in accordance with the definition of "Transaction
Expenses" set forth in Article 1.



(c)The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party as if he or she were a
party to this Agreement. The indemnification rights provided to each
Indemnified Party pursuant hereto will be in addition to all other
indemnification rights provided to such Indemnified Party under any Charter or
any Contract between any of the Citywide Entities and such Indemnified Party.



6.9 Notice of Developments by Heartland. Heartland will promptly notify
Citywide in writing if Heartland should discover that any representation or
warranty made by it in this Agreement was when made, has subsequently become
or will be on the Closing Date untrue in any respect. No disclosure pursuant
to this Section 6.9 will be deemed to prevent or cure any inaccuracy,
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of agreement.



6.10 Redemption of Citywide Series A Preferred Stock. Subject to receipt of
any approvals required from any Governmental Entities to either provide the
necessary funding or effect the redemption, Citywide will redeem all issued
and outstanding shares of Citywide Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time.



6.11 Statutory Trusts. Citywide, as the owner of the Statutory Trust
Securities that are common securities, will cause each of the Statutory Trusts
(a) to remain a statutory trust, (b) to otherwise continue to be classified as
a grantor trust for federal income Tax purposes, and (c) to cause each holder
of Statutory Trust Securities that are preferred securities to be treated as
owning an undivided beneficial interest in the Statutory Trust Debentures.
Upon the Effective Time, Heartland will assume Citywide's obligations and
acquire its rights relating to the Statutory Trusts, including Citywide's
obligations and rights under the Statutory Trust Debentures, Statutory Trust
Securities and the other Statutory Trust Agreements. In connection therewith,
Citywide will assist Heartland in assuming Citywide's obligations and
acquiring its rights under the Statutory Trusts, and will provide the
documentation required to make such assumption of obligations and acquisition
of rights effective (other than opinions of counsel, which Citywide will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), including any supplemental
indentures or certificates that may be required under the Statutory Trust
Agreements. Subject to the terms of the Statutory Trust Securities,
immediately prior to the Closing, Citywide will pay, or cause to be paid, to
the proper Persons all deferred and accrued but unpaid interest and any
outstanding fees relating to the Statutory Trust Debentures and the Statutory
Trusts.





6.12 Determination of Adjusted Tangible Common Equity. As soon as practicable
after the Determination Date, Citywide will prepare the Citywide Determination
Date Balance Sheet. Within five (5) Business Days following the Determination
Date, Citywide will prepare and deliver to Heartland its good faith
determination of (a) the Adjusted Tangible Common Equity, together with
reasonable support therefor (including the Citywide Determination Date Balance
Sheet), and (b) the Citywide Determination Date Transaction Expenses, together
with reasonable support therefor. If Citywide and Heartland agree on the
amount of the Adjusted Tangible Common Equity, such amount will be final and
conclusive. If Heartland and Citywide disagree as to such calculations and are
unable to reconcile their differences in writing within five (5) Business
Days, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, the items in dispute will
be submitted to a mutually acceptable independent national accounting firm in
the United States for final determination, and the calculations will be deemed
adjusted in accordance with the determination of the independent accounting
firm and will become binding, final and conclusive upon all of the parties
hereto. The independent accounting firm will consider only the items in
dispute and will be instructed to act within five (5) Business Days (or such
longer period as Citywide and Heartland may agree) to resolve all items in
dispute. Citywide and Heartland will share equally the payment of reasonable
fees and expenses of the independent accounting firm.



6.13 Heartland Board of Director Appointment and Board Observer Rights.
Heartland agrees to nominate Schmitz for election to its Board of Directors at
the Heartland 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. From the Effective Time
until Schmitz's election to the Board of Directors of Heartland, Schmitz will
have the right to attend all Heartland Board of Director meetings as an
observer (Schmitz, in his capacity as a Heartland Board of Directors' meeting
observer, is referred to herein as the "Board Observer"). The Board Observer
will not have voting rights or fiduciary obligations to Heartland or its
shareholders, but will be bound by the same confidentiality and insider
trading obligations as members of the Heartland Board of Directors. Heartland
will provide the Board Observer with notice of all regular and special
meetings of the Board of Directors of Heartland in the same manner as provided
to directors, and will provide to the Board Observer a copy of all materials
and information distributed at or prior to such meetings to the directors of
Heartland. Heartland will reimburse the Board Observer for reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses related to his attendance at Heartland Board of Directors
meetings. Other compensation will be provided to the Board Observer pursuant
to the Schmitz Consulting Agreement.



6.14 Heartland Confidential Information. Any confidential information or trade
secrets of each of Heartland and its Subsidiaries received by any Citywide
Entity, its employees or agents in the course of the negotiation and
consummation of the Merger or Bank Merger will be treated confidentially and
held in confidence pursuant to the Heartland NDA, and any correspondence,
memoranda, records, copies, documents and electronic or other media of any
kind containing either such confidential information or trade secrets or both
will be destroyed by the Citywide Entities or, at Heartland's request,
returned to Heartland if this Agreement is terminated as provided in Article
8\. Such information will not be used by any Citywide Entity or its employees
or agents to the detriment of Heartland and its Subsidiaries, and will at all
times be maintained and held in compliance with the Heartland NDA.



6.15 Special Tax Holdback.

(a)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Per Share Holdback Amount will be held back from the Actual Cash Consideration
that any holder of Citywide Common Stock is entitled to receive for each
Citywide Converted Share pursuant to Sections 2.3(a), 2.4 and 2.7 of this
Agreement. The Aggregate Tax Holdback Amount will be deposited into a separate
account at Heartland, and will be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Section 6.15. The Aggregate Tax Holdback Amount (or remaining portion thereof)
will bear 

interest at the rate of 3.00% per annum from the date such amount is deposited
until the date on which the Aggregate Tax Holdback Amount (or remaining
portion thereof) is distributed pursuant to Sections 6.15(f), (g) or (h).



(b)From and after the Closing Date, Heartland and its Affiliates (the "Tax
Indemnified Parties") will be indemnified and held harmless from and against
any Special Tax Losses incurred by them. Claims by the Tax Indemnified Parties
for indemnification of Special Tax Losses will be recovered solely from, and
be limited to, the Aggregate Tax Holdback Amount that, at the time of such
claim, has not been released pursuant to the terms hereof, and will be subject
to the terms and conditions of this Section 6.15.



(c)After the Closing Date, Heartland will promptly notify Schmitz in writing
of any Tax assessment, demand, claim, or notice of the commencement of an
audit received from any Governmental Entity (collectively, a "Tax Claim") with
respect to Taxes that could result in Special Tax Losses, but in any event
within 10 days following receipt thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
failure to give timely notice will not affect a Tax Indemnified Party's rights
to indemnification under this Section 6.15, except to the extent that the
rights of the former holders of Citywide Common Stock are prejudiced thereby.
Such notice will contain factual information (to the extent known) describing
the Tax Claim and will include copies of the relevant portion of any notices
or other documents received from any Governmental Entity with respect to any
such Tax Claim, and will be updated to include notices or other documents
subsequently received relating to such Tax Claim.



(d)Heartland will control any Tax Proceeding with respect to any Tax Claim
that could result in an indemnification claim payable from the Aggregate Tax
Holdback Amount for Special Tax Losses pursuant to this Section 6.15. Schmitz
will be entitled to employ counsel and Tax advisors with respect thereto at
his own expense; provided, however, that Schmitz will be entitled to
reimbursement of reasonable third party costs, after the payment of any
Special Tax Losses and prior to the distribution of any portion of the
Aggregate Tax Holdback to the former holders of Citywide Common Stock pursuant
to Sections 6.15(f), (g), (h) and (i); further provided, however, that Schmitz
will be entitled to reimbursement of his reasonable third party costs only
upon written request and presentation to Heartland of invoices and other
written documentation supporting such third party costs incurred by Schmitz.
Schmitz and his counsel and Tax advisors will be permitted to participate in
all Tax Proceedings at their own expense. Heartland will provide to Schmitz
and his counsel and Tax advisors all information reasonably requested with
respect to any Tax Proceeding. Heartland and its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and Schmitz, on the other hand, will cooperate, to the extent reasonably
requested by each other, in connection with any Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding,
including by the retention and (upon the reasonable request of Heartland and
its Affiliates or Schmitz, as the case may be) the provision of records,
documents and information reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim or Tax
Proceeding, and by making employees and other Persons available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information. Heartland, its Affiliates
and Schmitz will act in good faith to resolve any such Tax Claim or Tax
Proceeding. Neither Heartland nor any of its Affiliates will enter into any
settlement or compromise of any Tax Proceeding that could result in an
indemnification claim for Special Tax Losses payable from the Aggregate Tax
Holdback Amount without the prior written consent of Schmitz (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).



(e)If any of the Tax Indemnified Parties incurs any Special Tax Loss, it will
satisfy any indemnification rights with respect to such Special Tax Loss
solely from the Aggregate Tax 

Holdback Amount. The Tax Indemnified Parties will be deemed to incur a Special
Tax Loss (including reasonable out-of-pocket costs related thereto) at the
time such party pays any Special Tax Losses to a Governmental Entity following
the closing of a Tax Proceeding or a "determination" of a Tax Claim within the
meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, or at the time such party pays an
applicable third party for out-of -pocket costs related to the Tax Claim or
Tax Proceeding. The Aggregate Tax Holdback Amount (or the applicable portion
thereof) will be retained by Heartland from the Closing Date until the First
Release Date, the Second Release Date or the Third Release Date, as the case
may be. Heartland will provide to Schmitz an accounting of the Aggregate Tax
Holdback Amount remaining, plus any accrued interest thereon, on a monthly
basis and at the time any Special Tax Loss is paid out of the Aggregate Tax
Holdback Amount.



(f)Within 10 Business Days after the First Release Date, Heartland or a paying
agent appointed by Heartland will distribute (the "First Tax Holdback
Distribution") to the former holders of Citywide Common Stock $3.15 for each
Citywide Converted Share; provided, however, that such amount will be adjusted
upward or downward for (i) decreases attributable to all amounts paid or to be
paid by Heartland from the Aggregate Tax Holdback Amount in satisfaction of
any Special Tax Loss relating to Citywide's 2013 U.S. Federal income Tax
Liability and Tax year, (ii) decreases for all pending Tax Claims that could
reasonably result in a Special Tax Loss relating to Citywide's 2013 U.S.
Federal income Tax Liability and Tax year that would be paid from the
Aggregate Tax Holdback Amount, (iii) decreases for any reimbursement to
Schmitz pursuant to Section 6.15(d) for third-party expenses incurred by
Schmitz in connection with a Tax Proceeding related to Special Tax Losses
described in (i) or (ii) of this subsection 6.15(f), and (iv) increases for
interest accrued on the amount of the First Tax Holdback Distribution from the
Closing Date up to and including the date of distribution of the First Tax
Holdback Distribution.



(g)Within 10 Business Days after the Second Release Date, Heartland or a
paying agent appointed by Heartland will distribute (the "Second Tax Holdback
Distribution") to the former holders of Citywide Common Stock $0.58 for each
Citywide Converted Share; provided, however, that such amount will be adjusted
upward or downward for (i) decreases attributable to all amounts paid or to be
paid by Heartland from the Aggregate Tax Holdback Amount in satisfaction of
any Special Tax Loss relating to Citywide's 2014 U.S. Federal or Colorado
state income Tax Liability and Tax year, (ii) decreases for all pending Tax
Claims that could reasonably result in a Special Tax Loss relating to
Citywide's 2014 U.S. Federal or Colorado state income Tax Liability and Tax
year that would be paid from the Aggregate Tax Holdback Amount, (iii)
decreases for any reimbursement to Schmitz pursuant to Section 6.15(d) for
third-party expenses incurred by Schmitz in connection with a Tax Proceeding
related to Special Tax Losses described in (i) or (ii) of this subsection
6.15(g), and (iv) increases for interest accrued on the amount of the Second
Tax Holdback Distribution from the Closing Date up to and including the date
of distribution of the Second Tax Holdback Distribution.



(h)Within 10 Business Days after the Third Release Date, Heartland or a paying
agent appointed by Heartland will distribute (the "Third Tax Holdback
Distribution") to the former holders of Citywide Common Stock $0.44 for each
Citywide Converted Share; provided, however, that such amount will be adjusted
upward or downward for (i) decreases attributable to all amounts paid or to be
paid by Heartland from the Aggregate Tax Holdback Amount in satisfaction of
any Special Tax Loss relating to Citywide's 2013 Colorado state income Tax
Liability and Tax year, (ii) decreases for all pending Tax Claims that could
reasonably result in a Special Tax Loss relating to Citywide's 2013 Colorado
state income Tax Liability and Tax year that would be paid from the Aggregate
Tax Holdback Amount, (iii) decreases for any reimbursement to Schmitz pursuant
to 

Section 6.15(d) for third-party expenses incurred by Schmitz in connection
with a Tax Proceeding related to Special Tax Losses described in (i) or (ii)
of this subsection 6.15(h), and (iv) increases for interest accrued on the
amount of the Third Tax Holdback Distribution from the Closing Date up to and
including the date of distribution of the Third Tax Holdback Distribution.



(i)Any amounts of the Aggregate Tax Holdback Amount that are retained by
Heartland pursuant to Section 6.15(f)(ii), (g)(ii) or (h)(ii) due to a pending
Tax Claim, decreased by the amount of any reimbursement to Schmitz pursuant to
Section 6.15(d) for third-party expenses incurred by Schmitz in connection
with a Tax Proceeding related to Special Tax Losses described in Section
6.15(f)(ii), (g)(ii) or (h)(ii), will be promptly distributed to the former
holders of Citywide Common Stock pro rata in accordance with their holdings of
each Citywide Converted Share after the final resolution of such pending Tax
Claim and the payment of any Special Tax Losses attributable thereto, but in
any event within 10 Business Days following the final resolution of such
pending Tax Claim and the payment of any applicable Special Tax Losses
attributable thereto.



(j)By approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or by
executing a Letter of Transmittal, each holder of Citywide Common Stock will
have irrevocably (i) authorized and appointed Schmitz as such holder's
representative to act on behalf of the holder with respect to the matters set
forth in this Section 6.15, (ii) ratified and approved the reimbursement of
expenses incurred by Schmitz in the manner set forth in Section 6.15(d), and
(iii) agreed that Schmitz will not be liable, responsible or accountable in
damages or otherwise to the holders of Citywide Common Stock for any
Liabilities incurred by reason of any error in judgment or any act or failure
to act arising out of the activities of Schmitz on behalf or in respect of the
holders of Citywide Common Stock, including (A) the failure to perform any
acts he is not expressly obligated to perform under this Agreement, (B) any
acts or failures to act made in good faith or on the advice of legal counsel,
accountants or other consultants to Schmitz, or (C) any other matter beyond
the control of Schmitz.

ARTICLE 8

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER



8.1 Reasons for Termination. This Agreement, by prompt written notice given to
the other parties prior to or at the Closing, may be terminated:



(a)by mutual consent of the Boards of Directors of Heartland and Citywide;



(b)by either party in the event a Law or Governmental Order will have been
enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated, issued or deemed applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Entity that
prohibits the Closing;



(c)by either party in the event any approval, consent or waiver of any
Governmental Entity required to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will have been denied and such denial has
become final and non-appealable (unless such denial arises out of, or results
from, a material breach by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement of
any representation, warranty or covenant of such party);



(d)by Citywide if:



(i)the Closing has not occurred by September 30, 2017 (the "Termination
Date"); provided that Citywide will not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this clause (d)(i) if (x) Citywide's failure to comply
in all material respects with its obligations under this Agreement has
prevented the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(y) Citywide has refused, after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.1 and 7.2, to close in accordance with Section 2.9 or (z) the
circumstances or events underlying the termination rights set forth in clauses
(d)(iii) or (d)(iv) of this Section 8.1 will have occurred;



(ii)Heartland will have breached any representation, warranty or agreement of
Heartland in this Agreement in any material respect and such breach cannot be
or is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach is
given by Citywide to Heartland;



(iii)at the Citywide Shareholder Meeting, this Agreement will not have been
duly adopted by the Required Citywide Shareholder Vote;



(iv)(A) Citywide will have delivered to Heartland a written notice of the
intent of Citywide to enter into a merger, acquisition or other agreement
(including an agreement in principle) to effect a Superior Proposal based on
an Acquisition Proposal received by it, (B) five business days have elapsed
following delivery to Heartland of such written notice by Citywide, (C) during
such five Business Day period Citywide has fully complied with the terms of
Section 5.8, including informing Heartland of the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, with the intent of enabling Heartland to agree to a modification of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be effected, (D) at the end of such five business-day
period the Board of Directors of the Citywide will have continued reasonably
to believe that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (E)
Citywide pays to Heartland the termination fee in accordance with Section 8.4,
and (F) Citywide will have entered into a merger, acquisition or other
agreement (including an agreement in principle) to effect a Superior Proposal
or the Board of Directors of Citywide will have resolved to do so;



(v)at the Heartland Shareholder Meeting, the Heartland Charter Amendment will
not have been duly adopted by the requisite shareholder vote necessary to
approve such amendment;



(vi)at any time within five Business Days after the Determination Date, but
only if:



(x) the Heartland Determination Date Stock Price (as defined below) is less
than $35.00 per share; and



(y) the number obtained by dividing the Heartland Determination Date Stock
Price by the Initial Heartland Stock Price (as defined below) is less than the
number obtained by dividing (A) the Final Index Price (as defined below) by
(B) the Initial Index Price (as defined below) and subtracting 0.175 from such
quotient; provided, however, that a termination by Citywide pursuant to this
Section 8.1(d)(vi) will have no force and effect if Heartland agrees in
writing (within five Business Days after receipt of Citywide's written notice
of such termination) to increase the Exchange Ratio to an amount equal to (i)
(X) the Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (Y) the Heartland Determination Date
Stock Price, divided by (ii) $35.00. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
above, Heartland, at its option, may elect to retain the original Exchange
Ratio, and, in lieu of altering such Exchange Ratio, increase the Actual Cash
Consideration so that each holder of Citywide Common Stock is entitled to
receive the same value as of the Effective Time for each share of Citywide
Common Stock as such holder would have received had the original Exchange
Ratio been altered in accordance with the preceding sentence. If within such
five-Business Day period, Heartland delivers written notice to Citywide that
Heartland intends to proceed with the Merger by paying such additional
consideration as contemplated by the preceding sentence, and notifies Citywide
in writing of the revised Exchange Ratio or the revised Actual Cash
Consideration, then no termination will occur pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) 

(vi), and this Agreement will remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms (except that the Exchange Ratio or the Actual Cash
Consideration will be modified in accordance with this Section 8.1(d)(vi)).



For purposes of this Section 8.1(d)(vi), the following terms will have the
meanings indicated below:



"Final Index Price" means the average of the daily closing value of the Index
for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on and including the trading day
immediately preceding the 10th day prior to the Determination Date.



"Heartland Determination Date Stock Price" means (a) the sum, for each of the
15 consecutive trading days ending on and including the trading day
immediately preceding the 10th day prior to the Determination Date, of the
product of (i) the closing price of Heartland Common Stock as quoted on the
NASDAQ Global Select Market for such trading day, multiplied by, (ii) the
trading volume of Heartland Common Stock reported on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market for such trading day, divided by (b) the aggregate trading volume over
such 15-day period.



"Index" means the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index (KRX) or, if such index is
not available, such substitute or similar index as substantially replicates
the KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index (KRX).



"Index Ratio" means the Final Index Price divided by the Initial Index Price.



"Initial Heartland Stock Price" means $45.75.



"Initial Index Price" means the closing value of the Index on the date
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.



If Heartland or any company belonging to the Index declares or effects a stock
dividend, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction
between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the prices for
the common stock of such company will be appropriately adjusted for the
purposes of applying this Section 8.1(d)(vi).



(vii)any of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 will have become
impossible to satisfy (other than through a failure of Citywide to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement).



(e)by Heartland if:



(i)the Closing has not occurred by the Termination Date; provided that
Heartland will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
clause (e)(i) if (x) Heartland's failure to comply fully with its obligations
under this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (y) Heartland has refused, after
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.3, to close in
accordance with Section 2.9; 

(ii)Citywide will have breached any representation, warranty or agreement in
this Agreement in any material respect and such breach cannot be or is not
cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach is given by
Heartland to Citywide;



(iii)at the Citywide Shareholder Meeting, this Agreement will not have been
duly adopted by the Required Citywide Shareholder Vote;



(iv)at the Heartland Shareholder Meeting, the Heartland Charter Amendment will
not have been duly adopted by the requisite shareholder vote necessary to
approve such amendment; or



(v)any of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 will have become
impossible to satisfy (other than through a failure of Heartland to comply
with its obligations under this Agreement).



8.2 Effect of Termination. Except as provided in Sections 5.2(b) and (c),
6.14, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 and Article 9, which also survive the termination of
this Agreement, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, this
Agreement will forthwith become void, there will be no Liability under this
Agreement on the part of Heartland, Citywide or any of their respective
Representatives or Subsidiaries, and all rights and obligations of each party
hereto will cease; provided, however, that, subject to Sections 8.3, and 8.4,
nothing herein will relieve any party from Liability arising out of its own
fraud, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement.



8.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all Expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 8.1(d)(iii), 8.1(e)(ii) or
8.1(e)(iii), then Citywide will pay to Heartland, within five Business Days of
presentation by Heartland of reasonably detailed invoices for the same, all
Expenses reasonably incurred by Heartland, and, if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Sections 8.1(d)(ii), 8.1(d)(v) or 8.1(e)(iv), then
Heartland will pay to Citywide, within five Business Days of presentation by
Citywide of reasonably detailed invoices for the same, all Expenses reasonably
incurred by Citywide; provided, however, in either event, neither party's
reimbursement obligation hereunder will exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate. As
used in this Agreement, "Expenses" will consist of all out-of-pocket expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
experts and consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates) incurred by a
party in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the solicitation of
the approval of the Merger by holders of Citywide Common Stock and all other
matters related to the consummation of the Merger.



8.4 Termination Fee. If this Agreement is terminated by Citywide pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(iv), or by Heartland pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii) because of
a breach of any portion of Section 5.8 or Section 6.3(a), then Citywide will
pay to Heartland (in lieu of any payment that may be due under Section 8.3), a
termination fee of $8,500,000 as the sole and exclusive remedy of Heartland
(including any remedy for specific performance), as agreed-upon liquidated
damages.



8.5 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing approved by the parties to this Agreement and signed on behalf of each
of the parties hereto.



8.6 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other parties hereto or (b) waive compliance with any of the agreements of
any other parties or with any conditions to its own obligations, in each case
only to the extent such obligations, agreements and conditions are intended
for its benefit.

9.3 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned by any party to this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, except that Heartland may assign any of its rights under this
Agreement to one or more Subsidiaries of Heartland, so long as Heartland
remains responsible for the performance of all of its obligations under this
Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and all of the provisions
of this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns.



9.4 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for Section 6.8, which is intended to
benefit each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives,
nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement confers any rights or
remedies upon any Person that is not a party or permitted assign of a party to
this Agreement.



9.5 Schedules.

(a)Prior to or simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement, Citywide
delivered to Heartland the Disclosure Schedules, which set forth, among other
things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
Article 4 or to one or more covenants contained herein (whether or not such
section of this Agreement expressly references a schedule thereto). Except as
set forth in the Disclosure Schedules, the information contained therein is
dated as of the date of this Agreement or, if delivered pursuant to Section
6.7, as of such date delivered. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a
representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.



(b)For purposes of this Agreement, a Schedule relating to a certain section
may incorporate by reference disclosures made in other Schedules; provided,
however, that any disclosure with respect to a particular Schedule will be
deemed adequately disclosed in other Schedules to the extent it is readily
apparent from the nature of the disclosure that such disclosure also applies
to such other Schedules. Nothing in a Schedule is deemed adequate to disclose
an exception to a representation or warranty made in this Agreement unless the
Schedule identifies the exception with reasonable particularity.



9.6 Interpretation. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. References to Sections and Articles refer to Sections and
Articles of this Agreement unless otherwise stated. Words such as "herein,"
"hereinafter," "hereof," "hereto," "hereby" and "hereunder," and words of like
import, unless the context requires otherwise, refer to this Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto). As used in this Agreement, the
masculine, feminine and neuter genders will be deemed to include the others if
the context requires. Any singular term in this Agreement will be deemed to
include the plural, and any plural term the singular if the context requires.
Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "but not limited
to," whether or not they are in fact followed by those words or words of like
import. "Writing", "written" and comparable terms refer to printing, typing
and other means of reproducing words (including electronic media) in a visible
form. Any reference to any money or currency or use of "$" will be in U.S.
dollars. Except as the context may otherwise require, references to any
Contract are to that Contract as amended, modified or supplemented from time
to time in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; provided that with
respect to any Contract listed on any Schedules hereto, all such amendments,
modifications or supplements must also be listed in the appropriate Schedule.
References to a statute will be to such statute, as amended from time to time,
and to the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. References to any
Person include the successors and permitted assigns of that Person. References
from or through any date mean, unless otherwise specified, from and including
or through and including, respectively.



9.7 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties will negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement and to preserve each party's
anticipated benefits under this Agreement.



9.8 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, together with the NDA, contains the
complete agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or between the parties,
written or oral. Citywide acknowledges that Heartland has made no
representations, warranties, agreements, undertakings or promises except for
those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in agreements referred to
herein that survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.



9.9 Governing Law. THE DOMESTIC LAW, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS
PRINCIPLES, OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WILL GOVERN ALL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE
CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND INTERPRETATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY THIS AGREEMENT.



9.10 Specific Performance. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that
the subject matter of this Agreement, including the business, assets and
properties of each of the Citywide Entities, is unique, that the other party
would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached, and that the remedies at Law would not be adequate to
compensate such other parties not in default or in breach. Accordingly, each
of the parties agrees that the other party will be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at
Law or in equity (without any requirement that Heartland provide any bond or
other security). The parties waive any defense that a remedy at Law is
adequate and any requirement to post bond or provide similar security in
connection with actions instituted for injunctive relief or specific
performance of this Agreement.



9.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 9.11.



9.12 Investigation of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. No
investigation made by or on behalf of the parties hereto or the results of any
such investigation will constitute a waiver of any representation, warranty or
covenant of any other party. 



9.13 No Survival of Representations. The representations, warranties and
covenants made by Citywide and Heartland in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement will terminate on, and will
have no further force or effect after, the first to occur of (a) the Effective
Time or (b) the date on which this Agreement is terminated as set forth
herein, except for Sections 5.7, 6.1, 6.5, 6.8, and 6.13 and Article 9, each
of which apply in whole or in part after the Effective Time, or Sections
5.2(b) and (c), 6.14, 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4, and Article 9, each of which survive
the termination of this Agreement.
