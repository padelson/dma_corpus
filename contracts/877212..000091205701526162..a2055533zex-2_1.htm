outstanding Existing Options for Company Common Stock, whether or not exercised or converted at the time of determination) (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Minimum Condition</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>").
The obligation of Merger Sub to commence the Offer and to accept for payment and to pay for any shares tendered shall be subject to the conditions set forth in Annex I hereto. Subject to the Minimum
Condition and the conditions set forth in Annex I hereto, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for shares tendered as soon as Merger Sub is legally permitted to do so under

pursuant to the Offer constitutes less than 90% of the outstanding Company Common Stock, without the consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (subject to applicable law) have the right to
provide for a "subsequent offering period" (as contemplated by Rule&nbsp;14d-11 under the Exchange Act) for up to 20 Business Days after Merger Sub's acceptance for payment and payment

party bound by or liable with respect to, any Employee Benefit Plan. All of the Company's Employee Benefit Plans are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws, including ERISA
and the Code. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts which would adversely affect the tax qualified status of any of the Company's Existing Plans which are intended to meet the
requirements of Section&nbsp;401(a) of the Code. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>ERISA; Code</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. There is no accumulated funding deficiency, within the meaning of Section&nbsp;302 of ERISA or
Section&nbsp;412 of the Code, in connection with any Employee Benefit Plan of the Company and the Company ERISA Affiliates that is an "employee pension plan," as that term is defined in
Section&nbsp;3(2) of ERISA. No reportable event, as defined in ERISA (other than reportable events for which the 30-day notice requirement has been waived), has occurred in connection
with any Company Employee Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension plan," as that term is defined in Section&nbsp;3(2) of ERISA. The Company's Employee Benefit Plans have not, nor has any fiduciary
with respect to the Company's Employee Benefit Plans, engaged in any non-exempt prohibited transaction as defined in ERISA or the Code for which the Company or any Company Affiliate may be
liable that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate is contributing to, or is required to contribute, nor
does any such party
have any liability (including contingent withdrawal liability) with respect to, any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section&nbsp;412 of the Code, including any multiemployer plan, as defined in
Section&nbsp;3(37) of ERISA. </FONT></P>

Affiliates is not less than the present value of the accrued benefits under each such Employee Benefit Plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions (to the extent reasonable) presently used for funding
purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such Employee Benefit Plan's actuary with respect to such Employee Benefit Plan; and all contributions or other amounts payable by the Company
as of the Effective Time with respect to each of its Employee Benefit Plans in respect of current or prior plan years have been either paid or accrued on the balance sheet of the Company. There are no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Employee Benefit Plans or any trusts
related thereto that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Other Plan Obligations</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate, nor
any of its Employee Benefit Plans, nor any trust created thereunder, nor any fiduciary thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection with which the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate, any of
its Employee Benefit Plans, any such trust, or any fiduciary thereof, or any party dealing with any of its Employee Benefit Plans or any such trust could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section&nbsp;409 or 502(i)&nbsp;of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Section&nbsp;4975 or 4976 of the Code that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. No Employee Benefit Plan of the Company provides death or medical benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former employees of the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate
beyond their retirement or other termination of service other than (1)&nbsp;coverage mandated by applicable Law or (2)&nbsp;death benefits under any "employee pension plan," as that term is
