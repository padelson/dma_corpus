Effective Time, subject to Section 2.5(e), (i) each .00001% of an LLC Interest
then outstanding and owned by a holder of LLC Interests which is a Class A
Member in such capacity shall, by virtue of the Contribution, be exchanged for
4.9951 shares of Holdings Common Stock (the "Class A Exchange Ratio"), (ii) each
 .00001% of an LLC Interest then outstanding and owned by a holder of LLC
Interests which is a Class B Member in such capacity shall, by virtue of the

such capacity shall, by virtue of the Contribution, be exchanged for 2.3365
shares of Holdings Common Stock (the "Class C Exchange Ratio" and, collectively
with the Class A Exchange Ratio and the Class B Exchange Ratio, the
"Earlychildhood Exchange Ratio"). Upon such Contribution, all such LLC Interests
shall be transferred in full, together with all right, title and interest in and
to such LLC Interests, to Holdings and each person who was formerly a holder of
an LLC Interest shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the shares of Holdings Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor, without interest thereon.

      Section 2.2    Conversion of SmarterKids Capital Stock. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the SmarterKids Merger and without any action on the part of
any of the parties hereto or the holders of any shares of SmarterKids Common
Stock or capital stock of Merger Sub:

      (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of the
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

      (b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. All shares of SmarterKids Common Stock
that are owned by SmarterKids (including treasury stock) shall be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist and no shares of Holdings Common Stock or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

      (c) Exchange Ratio for SmarterKids Common Stock. Subject to Section
2.5(e), each issued and outstanding share of SmarterKids Common Stock (other
than shares to be

                                       5
<PAGE>

canceled in accordance with Section 2.2(b)) shall be converted into the right to
receive one (1) share of Holdings Common Stock (the "SmarterKids Exchange
Ratio"). All such shares of SmarterKids Common Stock, when so converted, shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the shares of Holdings Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Holdings Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor,
in each case upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section
2.5 and without interest thereon.

      Section 2.3    Treatment of Outstanding Options, SmarterKids Warrants, and
SmarterKids Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

      (a)   Earlychildhood Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase LLC Interests (an "Earlychildhood Option") under any option
plans of Earlychildhood in effect on the date hereof (the "Earlychildhood Option
Plans"), whether vested or unvested, shall be deemed to constitute an option to
acquire, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Earlychildhood Option the same number of shares of Holdings Common Stock as
the holder of such Earlychildhood Option would have been entitled to receive
pursuant to the Contribution had such holder exercised such option in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole
number), at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to
(x) the aggregate exercise price for the LLC Interests purchasable pursuant to
such Earlychildhood Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
(y) the number of full shares of Holdings Common Stock deemed purchasable
pursuant to such Earlychildhood Option in accordance with the foregoing. Prior
to the Effective Time, Earlychildhood shall make any such amendments to the
terms of the Earlychildhood Option Plans that are necessary to give effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3(a) and to make such
Earlychildhood Option Plans and the provisions thereof consistent with option
plans customary for public companies.

      (b) SmarterKids Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase shares of SmarterKids Common Stock (a "SmarterKids Stock
Option") under the SmarterKids Stock Plans (as defined in Section 4.2(a)),
whether vested or unvested, shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire,
on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such SmarterKids Stock
Option the same number of shares of Holdings Common Stock as the holder of such
SmarterKids Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the
SmarterKids Merger had such holder exercised such option in full immediately
prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole number), at a
price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the
aggregate exercise price for the shares of SmarterKids Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to such SmarterKids Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by (y) the number of full shares of Holdings Common Stock deemed
purchasable pursuant to such SmarterKids Stock Option in accordance with the
foregoing. Prior to the Effective Time, SmarterKids shall make any such
amendments to the terms of the SmarterKids Stock Plans that are necessary to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3(b). It is the
intention of the parties that any SmarterKids Stock Options that are "incentive
stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code and which are
converted into options to acquire Holdings Common Stock pursuant to this Section
2.3(b) qualify

                                       6
<PAGE>

following the Effective Time as incentive stock options. Such adjustments
pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) are intended to be effective in a manner which
is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code.

      (c) SmarterKids Warrants. At the Effective Time, each SmarterKids Warrant
(as defined in Section 4.2(a)) shall thereafter represent solely the right to
acquire, on substantially the terms and conditions as are currently applicable
under the SmarterKids Warrants, the same number of shares of Holdings Common
Stock as a holder of the SmarterKids Warrants would have been entitled to
receive pursuant to the SmarterKids Merger had such holder exercised such
SmarterKids Warrants in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded
down to the nearest whole number), at the price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of
SmarterKids Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the SmarterKids Warrants
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the number of full shares
of Holdings Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to the SmarterKids Warrants
in accordance with the foregoing. Prior to the Effective Time, SmarterKids shall
make any such amendments to the terms of the SmarterKids Warrants that are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.3(c).

      (d) SmarterKids Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

                     (i) In the event that the current "payment period" (as such
term is used in the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan of SmarterKids (the
"SmarterKids Employee Stock Purchase Plan")), in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, ends prior to the Effective Time, SmarterKids shall use its
reasonable best efforts to terminate the SmarterKids Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, subject to Section 2.3(d)(iii) below, as of the date that the current
payment period ends (the "ESPP Termination Date").

                     (ii) In the event that the Effective Time occurs on or
prior to the end of the current payment period in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, SmarterKids shall use its reasonable best efforts, to the extent
permitted by law and the provisions of the SmarterKids Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, including any amendment provisions thereof, to cause the exercise date
applicable to the current payment period to be the last trading day on which the
shares of SmarterKids Common Stock are traded on Nasdaq immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Final SmarterKids Purchase Date"); provided, that, such
change in the Final SmarterKids Purchase Date will be conditioned upon the
consummation of the SmarterKids Merger. Subject to Section 2.3(d)(iii) below,
SmarterKids shall use its reasonable best efforts to terminate the SmarterKids
Employee Stock Purchase Plan immediately after the Final SmarterKids Purchase
Date and prior to the Effective Time.

                     (iii) On the occurrence of either the ESPP Termination Date
or the Final SmarterKids Purchase Date, as the case may be, SmarterKids shall
apply the funds credited as of such date under the SmarterKids Employee Stock
Purchase Plan within each participant's payroll withholdings account to the
purchase of whole shares of SmarterKids Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of the SmarterKids Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The cost to each
participant in the SmarterKids Employee Stock Purchase Plan for shares of
SmarterKids Common Stock will be the lower of 85% of the average market price of
SmarterKids Common

                                       7
<PAGE>

Stock on Nasdaq on (A) the first day of the then current offering period or (B)
the ESPP Termination Date or the Final SmarterKids Purchase Date, as the case
may be. No fractional shares of SmarterKids Common Stock shall be issued and any
payroll withholdings not used to purchase fractional shares of SmarterKids
Common Stock will be refunded, without interest to the participant.

                     (iv) It is the intention of the parties that
notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the exercise price, the
number of shares purchasable and the terms and conditions applicable to any
adjustments to the SmarterKids Employee Stock Purchase Plan and any employee
stock purchase plan maintained by Holdings will be determined so as to comply
with Sections 423 and 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder
such that the arrangement implemented under the SmarterKids Employee Stock
Purchase Plan by reason of the SmarterKids Merger not constitute a
"modification."

      Section 2.4    Cancellation of Holdings Common Stock. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Transactions and without any action on the part of any
holder of any LLC Interest or any holder of capital stock of SmarterKids or
Holdings, each share of Holdings Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

      Section 2.5    Exchange of Certificates. The procedures for exchanging
LLC Interests and shares of SmarterKids Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time for shares of Holdings Common Stock in the

and, together with the LLC Certificates, the "Certificates") whose shares were
converted pursuant to Section 2.2 into the right to receive shares of Holdings
Common Stock, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery

and SmarterKids may reasonably specify), and (B) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the SmarterKids Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Holdings Common Stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional

and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Holdings Common Stock, and
the SmarterKids Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be canceled.

                     (iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of LLC
Interests or SmarterKids Common Stock prior to the Effective Time which is not
registered in the transfer records of Earlychildhood or SmarterKids,
respectively, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Holdings
Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the Transfer Documents for such
LLC Interests or the SmarterKids Certificate representing such SmarterKids
Common Stock, as applicable, is presented to the Exchange Agent, or such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by Holdings (including Holdings),
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

                     (iv) Immediately after the Effective Time, (A) all LLC

and exchanged for shares of Holdings Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions set forth in subsection (i) above and (B) each outstanding

SmarterKids Common Stock would

                                       9

be or were, as the case may be, converted until the SmarterKids Certificate

laws, following the contribution of any such LLC Interest or surrender of any
such SmarterKids Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Holdings Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such contribution or
surrender, as applicable, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of Holdings Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
subsection (e) below and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole
shares of Holdings Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender
payable with respect to such whole shares of Holdings Common Stock.

      (d)   No Further Ownership Rights in LLC Interests and SmarterKids Common
Stock. All shares of Holdings Common Stock issued upon the delivery of the
Transfer Documents and/or surrender for exchange of the SmarterKids
Certificates, as applicable, in accordance with the terms hereof (including any
cash paid pursuant to subsection (c) or (e) of this Section 2.5) shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the LLC
Interests so contributed or to the shares of SmarterKids Common Stock
theretofore represented by such SmarterKids Certificates, as applicable, and
from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares
of SmarterKids Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time or registration of transfers on the ownership records of
Earlychildhood of LLC Interests held by holders thereof immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, SmarterKids Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Holdings for any reason, such
SmarterKids Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Section 2.5. If, after the Effective Time, Transfer Documents with respect to
valid LLC Interests are presented to Holdings for any reason, such LLC Interests
shall be deemed contributed to Holdings in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, effective as of the Effective Time and the holders thereof, in
exchange therefor, shall receive such number of shares of Holdings Common Stock
as may be calculated pursuant to the applicable Earlychildhood Exchange Ratio,
together, without interest, with cash in lieu of fractional shares as described
in Section 2.5(e).

      (e)   No Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock shall be issued upon the
contribution or surrender for exchange,

                                       10
<PAGE>

as applicable, of LLC Interests or SmarterKids Certificates, and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Holdings. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of LLC Interests or shares of SmarterKids Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time exchanged pursuant to the
Contribution or the SmarterKids Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Holdings Common Stock (after taking into
account the entire LLC Interest exchanged by such holder or all SmarterKids
Certificates delivered by such holder, as applicable) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a
share of Holdings Common Stock multiplied by the per share opening sales price
of Holdings Common Stock (as reported by the national securities exchange or
market on which such Holdings Common Stock is traded or quoted) on the first day
of trading of Holdings Common Stock on such exchange or market after the
Effective Time.

      (f)   Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the former holders of LLC Interests or the former
stockholders of SmarterKids on the 180th day after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Holdings upon demand, and any former holder or stockholder, as the
case may be, who has not previously complied with Section 1.2 or this Section
2.5 shall thereafter look only to Holdings for payment of such holder's or
stockholder's claim for Holdings Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Holdings Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect
to Holdings Common Stock.

      (g)   No Liability. None of Earlychildhood, SmarterKids or Holdings shall
be liable to any holder of LLC Interests or shares of SmarterKids Common Stock,
as the case may be, for any shares of Holdings Common Stock (or cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock or any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

      (h)   Withholding Rights. Holdings and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of LLC Interests or shares of
SmarterKids Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Holdings or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of LLC Interests or shares of SmarterKids Common Stock, as the case may
be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

      (i)   Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Holdings or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Holdings or the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the shares of Holdings Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and any

                                       11
<PAGE>

unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Holdings Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

      (j)   Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither
LLC Interests nor SmarterKids Certificates surrendered for exchange by any
Affiliate (as defined in Section 5.13) of Earlychildhood or SmarterKids shall be
exchanged until Holdings has received an Affiliate Agreement (as defined in
Section 5.13) substantially in the form of Exhibit J attached hereto from such
Affiliate.

                                 ARTICLE III.
               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF EARLYCHILDHOOD

      Earlychildhood represents and warrants to SmarterKids that the statements
contained in this Article III are true and correct, except as set forth herein
and in the disclosure schedules delivered by Earlychildhood to SmarterKids on or
before the date of this Agreement (the "Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule").
The Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs
corresponding to the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article
III and the disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify other paragraphs in this
Article III only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of
such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other paragraphs.

      Section 3.1    Organization of Earlychildhood. Each of Earlychildhood and
its Subsidiaries (as defined below) is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all
requisite corporate power to own, lease and operate its property and to carry on
its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted, and is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign limited liability
company or corporation, as the case may be, in each jurisdiction in which the
failure to be so qualified would have a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, properties, financial condition or results of operations of
Earlychildhood and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (an "Earlychildhood
Material Adverse Effect"). Except as set forth on the Earlychildhood Disclosure
Schedule, neither Earlychildhood nor any of its Subsidiaries, directly or
indirectly owns (other than ownership interests in Earlychildhood or in one or
more of its Subsidiaries) any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
that is mandatorily convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity.
A true, correct and complete copy of the organizational documents of
Earlychildhood and each of its Subsidiaries has been delivered to SmarterKids.
As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any
party, any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, of which (i) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is
a general partner (excluding partnerships the general partnership interests of
which held by such party or any Subsidiary of such party do not have a majority
of the voting interest in such partnership) or (ii) at least a majority of the
securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to
elect a majority of the board of directors or others performing similar
functions with respect to such corporation or other organization is directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its
Subsidiaries, or by such party and one or more of its Subsidiaries.

      Section 3.2    Earlychildhood Capital Structure.

      (a) The outstanding LLC Interests currently consist, and will consist on
the Closing Date, of the LLC Interests set forth in the Earlychildhood
Disclosure Schedule, which LLC Interests, subject to LLC Interests represented
by options granted under the Earlychildhood Option Plans, represent one hundred
percent (100%) of the membership and other equity interests in Earlychildhood.
Other than the persons set forth in the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule (the
"Members"), no other person owns or holds any LLC Interest or portion of an LLC
Interest, including, without limitation, an economic interest in Earlychildhood,
an interest in the profits or losses of Earlychildhood, an interest in the right
to affect the management of Earlychildhood or an interest in the right to
receive distributions from Earlychildhood. With respect to each Member, the
Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule sets forth such Member's designation as a
Class A Member, Class B Member or Class C Member, as applicable. Set forth on
the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule is the aggregate amount of LLC Interests
issuable pursuant to options granted and outstanding under the Earlychildhood
Option Plans as of the date hereof, and the entities or persons to whom such
options were granted. Except as may exist under the Earlychildhood Option Plan
or as otherwise set forth on the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule, there are
no outstanding subscriptions, calls, commitments, warrants or options for the
purchase of LLC Interests, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable
for LLC Interests, or any other commitments of any kind for the granting of
additional LLC Interests or other equity interests or securities issued by
Earlychildhood. All of the outstanding LLC Interests are duly authorized, fully
paid and nonassessable securities of Earlychildhood, free and clear of all
Encumbrances (as defined below). Except as set forth on the Earlychildhood
Disclosure Schedule, there are no contracts relating to the issuance, sale, or
transfer of any LLC Interests, or any portions of any LLC Interests. To the
knowledge of Earlychildhood, there are no voting trusts, proxies or other voting
agreements or understandings with respect to the outstanding LLC Interests. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Encumbrance" shall mean any charge, claim,
condition, equitable interest, lien, option, pledge, security interest, right of
first refusal or restriction of any kind, including any restriction on use,
voting, transfer, receipt of income or exercise of any other attribute of
ownership.

      (b)   All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of each of Earlychildhood's Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and all such shares are owned by
Earlychildhood or another Subsidiary free and clear of all Encumbrances. There
are no outstanding subscriptions, calls, commitments, warrants or options for
the purchase of shares of capital stock or equity interests, as the case may be,
or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock
or equity interests, as the case may be, or any other commitments of any kind
for the granting of additional shares of capital stock, other equity interests
or securities issued by any of Earlychildhood's Subsidiaries. There are no
contracts relating to the issuance, sale, or transfer of any shares of capital
stock or equity interests, as the case may be, of any of Earlychildhood's
Subsidiaries.

      Section 3.3    Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

      (a) Earlychildhood has all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents (as defined
below) to which it is a party and to consummate the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and each of the

                                       13
<PAGE>

Transaction Documents to which it is a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each of the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party by Earlychildhood have been duly authorized by
all necessary action on the part of Earlychildhood, its Management Committee and
its Members. Each holder of an LLC Interest outstanding on the date hereof has
executed and delivered a Consent Agreement in the form of Exhibit B attached
hereto and, assuming the due authorization and execution of the Consent
Agreement by each such Member, the Consent Agreements constitute the valid and
binding obligations of such Members, enforceable in accordance with their terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception (as hereafter defined). This
Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party have been
duly executed and delivered by Earlychildhood and constitute the valid and
binding obligations of Earlychildhood, enforceable in accordance with their
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equitable principles (the "Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception"). "Transaction Documents" means the Stockholder Support
Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Consent Agreement, the
Affiliate Agreement and the Lockup Agreement.

      (b) Except as set forth on the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents
to which it is a party by Earlychildhood does not, and the consummation of the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each of the Transaction
Documents to which Earlychildhood is a party will not, (i) conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, any provision of the organizational
documents of Earlychildhood (including the Operating Agreement) or any of the
organizational documents of any of Earlychildhood's Subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Earlychildhood Organizational Documents"), (ii) result in any violation or
breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a
default (or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, or require a consent or
waiver under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement, instrument or
obligation to which Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound,
or (iii) conflict with or violate any permit, concession, franchise, license,
judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable
to Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties
or assets, except in the case of (ii) and (iii) for any such conflicts,
violations, defaults, terminations, cancellations or accelerations which are
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have an
Earlychildhood Material Adverse Effect. The execution and delivery of each
Consent Agreement by the holders of all outstanding LLC Interests does not
conflict with, and will not result in any violation or breach of any provision
of, the Earlychildhood Organizational Documents.

      (c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any court, administrative agency or commission or
other governmental authority or instrumentality ("Governmental Entity") is
required by or with respect to Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and each of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (i) the filing of the
pre-merger notification report under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"),

                                       14
<PAGE>

if applicable, (ii) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings as may be required under applicable
state securities laws, and (iii) such other consents, authorizations, filings,
approvals and registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not be
reasonably likely to have an Earlychildhood Material Adverse Effect.
Earlychildhood is not a "$100 Million Person" within the meaning of the HSR Act
(and the Regulations thereunder) and William E. Simon & Sons Private Equity
Fund, L.P. (the "Fund"), to the extent the Fund is the "ultimate parent entity"
of Earlychildhood (as such term is used in the HSR Act and the Regulations
thereunder), is not, together, with all the entities that it controls, directly
and indirectly, a "$100 million Person" within the meaning of the HSR Act (and
the Regulations thereunder).

      Section 3.4    Books and Records. The books of account, minute books
(or any other books containing records of member or manager action) and record
books and other records which are material to the business of Earlychildhood and
its Subsidiaries, all of which have been made available to SmarterKids, are
complete and correct in all material respects and have been maintained in
accordance with sound business practices. The minute books (or any other books
containing records of member or manager action) of Earlychildhood and its
Subsidiaries contain, in all material respects, accurate records of all meetings
held of, and corporate or other action taken by, the Members, or the Management
Committee of Earlychildhood, or the stockholders or owners or board of directors
or other similar bodies of any of its Subsidiaries and no meeting has been held
for which minutes have not been prepared and are not contained in such minute
books. At the Closing, all of the books and records of Earlychildhood and its
Subsidiaries will be in the possession of Earlychildhood.

      Section 3.5    Financial Information.

      Earlychildhood has delivered to SmarterKids: (i) an audited consolidated
balance sheet of Earlychildhood and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and
the related audited consolidated statements of income, changes in members'
equity and cash flows of Earlychildhood and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year
then ended, together with the report thereon of KPMG, LLP, its independent
certified public accountants; (ii) an audited consolidated balance sheet of QTL
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and the related audited
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of QTL
Corporation for the nine months then ended, together with the report thereon of
KPMG LLP, its independent certified public accountants; (iii) an audited balance
sheet of Educational Products, Inc. as of March 31, 1999 and the related audited
statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of Educational
Products, Inc. for the fiscal year then ended, together with the report thereon
of KPMG LLP, its independent certified public accountants and (iv) an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of Earlychildhood and its Subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2000 (the "Earlychildhood Balance Sheet") and the related
unaudited consolidated statements of income, changes in members' equity, and
cash flows, including, in each case, the notes thereto (together with the
Earlychildhood Balance Sheet, the "Earlychildhood Financial Information"). The
Earlychildhood Financial Information has been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
(except as may be noted therein), and presents fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Earlychildhood and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis as of the respective dates and for the periods referred to in

                                       15
<PAGE>

such Earlychildhood Financial Information, except that the Earlychildhood
Financial Information is subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
and subject, in each case, to the notes regarding the matters reflected therein.
Except set forth on the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule, no financial
information of any entity are required to be included in the financial
statements of Earlychildhood under GAAP.

      Section 3.6    No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth on the
Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule or the Earlychildhood Balance Sheet and
except for normal or recurring liabilities incurred since the date of the
Earlychildhood Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices, Earlychildhood and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities,
either accrued, contingent or otherwise (whether or not required to be reflected
in the Earlychildhood Financial Information in accordance with GAAP), and
whether due or to become due, which, individually or in the aggregate, are
reasonably likely to have an Earlychildhood Material Adverse Effect.

      Section 3.7    Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents or as set forth on
the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule, since the date of the Earlychildhood
Balance Sheet, Earlychildhood has conducted its businesses only in the ordinary
course and in a manner consistent with past practice, and, since such date,
there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition, results of
operations, business, assets or properties of Earlychildhood or any of its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (an "Earlychildhood Material Adverse Change") or
any development or combination of developments of which the management of
Earlychildhood is aware that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is
reasonably likely to have, an Earlychildhood Material Adverse Effect, and, since
such date, there has not been any:

      (a)   (i) issuance of LLC Interests, or options or rights therefor, other
than pursuant to the Earlychildhood Option Plans through the date hereof; (ii)
purchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition by Earlychildhood of any
LLC Interest, parts of any LLC Interest or other rights or equity interests in
Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iii) declaration or payment of
any dividend or other distribution or payment in respect of any LLC Interest,
parts of any LLC Interest or other rights or equity interests in Earlychildhood
or any of its Subsidiaries, other than tax distributions made in the ordinary
course of business;

      (b)   amendment to the organizational documents of Earlychildhood or any
of its Subsidiaries (including the Operating Agreement);

      (c)   payment by Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries of any bonuses,
salaries or other compensation (including management or other similar fees but
excluding tax distributions) to any shareholder or member, as applicable,
managing member, member of the Management Committee or executive officer (except
for payments of salary, bonuses and other compensation payable for employment
services rendered in the ordinary course of business (in which case there has
been no increase in such payments)) or entry into any employment, severance or
similar contract with any such person;

      (d)   adoption of any new Employee Benefit Plan or Benefit Arrangement
(each as defined below) for or with any employees of Earlychildhood or any
Earlychildhood ERISA

                                       16
<PAGE>

Plan or other benefit obligations for or with any employees of Earlychildhood or
any Earlychildhood ERISA Affiliate or change any actuarial or other assumption

Employee Benefit Plans or Benefit Arrangements, or any change in the manner in
which contributions to any Earlychildhood Employee Benefit Plans or Benefit
Arrangements are made or the basis on which such contributions are determined;

      (e)   damage to or destruction or loss of any asset or property of
Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance,
that would have an Earlychildhood Material Adverse Effect;

of Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries (other than sales of inventory in
the ordinary course of business);

course of business;

      (h)   cancellation or waiver of any claims or rights by Earlychildhood or

ordinary course of business;

      (j)   material change by Earlychildhood or its Subsidiaries in their
respective accounting methods, principles or practices to which SmarterKids has
not previously consented in writing, except insofar as may be appropriate for
changes required by applicable law or GAAP;

      (k)   revaluations by Earlychildhood or its Subsidiaries of any of their
respective assets having an Earlychildhood Material Adverse Effect;

      (l)   agreement, whether oral or written, by Earlychildhood or any of its
Subsidiaries, with respect to or to do any of the foregoing; or

      (m)   other action or event that would have required the consent of
SmarterKids pursuant to Section 5.1 of this Agreement had such action or event
occurred after the date of this Agreement, and that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had, or is reasonably likely to have, an Earlychildhood Material
Adverse Effect.

      Section 3.8    Taxes.

      (a)   For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Tax" or, collectively,
"Taxes," means any and all federal, state, local and foreign taxes, assessments
and other governmental charges, duties, impositions and liabilities, including
taxes based upon or measured by gross receipts, income, profits, sales, use and
occupation, and value added, ad valorem, transfer, gains,

                                       17
<PAGE>

franchise, withholding, payroll, recapture, employment, excise, unemployment
insurance, social security, business license, occupation, business organization,
stamp, environmental and property taxes, together with all interest, penalties
and additions imposed with respect to such amounts. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Taxes" also includes any obligations under any agreements or
arrangements with any other person or any provision of law with respect to Taxes
of such other person (including pursuant to Treas. Reg. (S) 1.1502-6 or
comparable provisions of state, local or foreign tax law) and including any
liability for Taxes of any predecessor entity.

      (b)   Except as set forth on the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule,
Earlychildhood and each of its Subsidiaries have (i) timely filed all federal,
state, local and foreign Tax returns and reports required to be filed by them
prior to the date of this Agreement (taking into account all applicable
extensions) and such Tax returns are accurate and complete in all material
respects, (ii) timely paid or accrued all Taxes owed (whether or not shown on
any Tax return), and (iii) paid all Taxes for which a notice of assessment or
collection has been received (other than amounts being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings). None of the Tax returns filed or Taxes payable by
either Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries (or, to the knowledge of
Earlychildhood, by the holders of the LLC Interests as they relate to the items
of income, deductions, etc. of Earlychildhood) have been the subject of an
audit, action, suit, proceeding, claim, examination, deficiency or assessment by
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or any other governmental authority,
and no such audit, action, suit, proceeding, claim, examination, deficiency or
assessment is currently pending or, to the knowledge of Earlychildhood or any of
its Subsidiaries, contemplated or threatened. The unpaid Taxes of Earlychildhood
and each of its Subsidiaries (whether or not yet payable) attributable to any
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date did not, as of
September 30, 2000, exceed the reserve for actual Taxes (as opposed to any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) as shown on the Earlychildhood Balance Sheet, and will not
exceed such reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date
in accordance with the reasonable past custom and practice of Earlychildhood and
its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax returns. Earlychildhood and each of its
Subsidiaries will not incur any liability for Taxes from September 30, 2000
through the Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with reasonable past practice, and will not incur any Tax liability
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as
set forth on the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule, neither Earlychildhood nor
any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to make any adjustment under Section 481(a)
of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax law)
by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise, and neither
Earlychildhood nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to make any such
adjustment as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Earlychildhood and each of its Subsidiaries have timely withheld or collected
and paid over to the appropriate governmental authorities (or are properly
holding for such timely payment) all Taxes required by law to be withheld or
collected. None of the Subsidiaries of Earlychildhood which is a corporation has
made an election under Section 341(f) of the Code. There are no liens for Taxes
upon the assets of Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries (other than liens
for Taxes that are not yet due or that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings). No extension of a statute of limitations relating to
any Taxes is in effect with respect to Earlychildhood and its Subsidiaries.

                                       18
<PAGE>

      (c)   Earlychildhood and any non-corporate Subsidiaries of Earlychildhood
have at all times during their existence been properly treated as a partnership
or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes.
No Subsidiary of Earlychildhood which is a corporation has been a member of an
affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated federal income tax return
(or a group of corporations filing a consolidated, combined or unitary income
tax return under comparable provisions of state, local or foreign tax law) for
any taxable period. Neither Earlychildhood nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
or is a party to or member of any joint venture, partnership, limited liability
company, or other arrangement or contract which could be treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes. None of the LLC Interests nor any
assets transferred from Earlychildhood to Holdings, whether an actual transfer

      Section 3.10   Intellectual Property.

      (a)   Each of Earlychildhood and its Subsidiaries owns free and clear of
all Encumbrances or is licensed or otherwise possesses legally enforceable
rights to use all patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights,
and any applications for such patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks,
copyrights, know-how, computer software programs or applications and tangible or
intangible proprietary information or material that are necessary to conduct the
business of each of Earlychildhood and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted
(the "Earlychildhood Intellectual Property"), subject to such exceptions that
would not be reasonably likely to have an Earlychildhood Material Adverse
Effect. The Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule contains a list of all of the
following that are material within the Earlychildhood Intellectual Property: (i)
patents and patent applications; (ii) trademarks, trade names and service marks
and registrations thereof and applications therefor; and (iii) registered
copyrights and applications therefor. The Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule
identifies the owner of each item listed thereon and, in the case of
registrations and applications, the application or registration number and date.

      (b)   To the knowledge of Earlychildhood, Earlychildhood or a Subsidiary
thereof is the sole and exclusive owner or a licensee of all of the material
Earlychildhood Intellectual Property. All of the material Earlychildhood
Intellectual Property will be owned or available for use by Earlychildhood or
its Subsidiaries on terms and conditions immediately following the Effective
Time identical to the terms and conditions pertaining to Earlychildhood or a
Subsidiary thereof immediately prior to the Effective Time. Earlychildhood or a
Subsidiary thereof has taken reasonable measures to protect the proprietary
nature of the Earlychildhood Intellectual Property and to maintain in confidence
the trade secrets and confidential information that they own or use. No other
person has any rights to any material item of the Earlychildhood Intellectual
Property or has any rights to any of the material Earlychildhood Intellectual
Property, except that the items of the Earlychildhood Intellectual Property
identified on the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule as licensed to
Earlychildhood or a Subsidiary thereof are owned by the respective owners
identified on the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule, and, to the knowledge of
Earlychildhood, no person is infringing, violating or misappropriating any of
the material Earlychildhood Intellectual Property.

      (c)   To the knowledge of Earlychildhood, none of the activities or
business presently conducted by Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries
infringes or violates, or constitutes a misappropriation of, any intellectual
property of any other person, and, if without the knowledge of Earlychildhood,
such activities or business presently conducted by Earlychildhood or any of its
Subsidiaries does infringe, violate or constitute a misappropriation of any
intellectual property of any other person, no such infringement, violation or
misappropriation, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have
an Earlychildhood Material Adverse Effect. None of Earlychildhood, any
Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Earlychildhood has received any complaint, claim
or notice alleging any such infringement, violation or misappropriation.

      (d)   With respect to each item of the Earlychildhood Intellectual
Property:

                     (i) Earlychildhood or a Subsidiary thereof possesses all
right, title and interest in and to such item, except for any Earlychildhood
Third Party Rights (as defined below);

                     (ii)  such item is not subject to any outstanding judgment,
order, decree, stipulation or injunction; and

                     (iii) neither Earlychildhood nor any of its Subsidiaries
has agreed, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice or in conjunction with product or service sales or licenses, to
indemnify any person for or against any infringement, misappropriation or other
conflict with respect to such item.

      (e)   The Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule identifies each item of the
intellectual property used by Earlychildhood or any Subsidiary that is owned by
a party other than Earlychildhood ("Earlychildhood Third Party Rights"), and all
licenses or other agreements pursuant to which Earlychildhood or any Subsidiary
uses such items are listed on the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule. With
respect to each such item:

                     (i)   the license or other agreement covering any such
material item is valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect with
respect to Earlychildhood or a Subsidiary thereof and, to the knowledge of
Earlychildhood, with respect to every other party thereto;

                     (ii)  each such license or other agreement, including
licenses to all third-party software listed in the Earlychildhood Disclosure
Schedule other than generally commercially available software, to which
Earlychildhood or a Subsidiary thereof is a party, is assignable by
Earlychildhood or such Subsidiary without the consent or approval of, or any
payment to, any party except as set forth on the Earlychildhood Disclosure
Schedule, and, except as set forth on the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule,
all such licenses and other agreements will continue to be valid, binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect immediately following the Effective
Time in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and the consummation of the transactions will not conflict with,
result in a violation or breach of or constitute a default under (with notice or
lapse of time or both) any such license or other agreement; and

                     (iii) neither Earlychildhood, any Subsidiary thereof nor,
to the knowledge of Earlychildhood, any other party to any such license or other
agreement, is in breach or default under any such license or other agreement
and, to the knowledge of Earlychildhood, no event has occurred that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a breach or default or permit
termination, modification or acceleration thereunder.

      Section 3.11   Product Warranty and Liability.

      (a)   No reserves have been provided for by Earlychildhood to cover
potential claims under existing customer indemnification agreements.

      (b)   Except as to claims, actions, proceedings or investigations which
have been asserted but as to which no notice has been given to Earlychildhood or
any of its Subsidiaries, and except as set forth on the Earlychildhood
Disclosure Schedule, there are no product liability claims, actions, proceedings
or investigations pending or, to the knowledge of Earlychildhood, threatened
against Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective assets,
or, to the

                                       21
<PAGE>

knowledge of Earlychildhood, any state of facts existing which could give rise
to any such product liability claim, action, proceeding or investigation.

      (c)   To the knowledge of Earlychildhood, no claims have been made that
the products sold by Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries are not effective
for the uses such products purport to serve. To the knowledge of Earlychildhood,
neither Earlychildhood nor any of its Subsidiary has received any written notice
that any product manufactured or distributed by Earlychildhood or any of its
Subsidiaries has not been manufactured in accordance with "current Good
Manufacturing Practices" (as such term is commonly understood within
Earlychildhood's industry) or has not been properly labeled for its approved
use.

or conditions of any material agreement, contract or commitment set forth or
required to be set forth in Section 3.12 of the Earlychildhood Disclosure
Schedule ("Earlychildhood Material Contracts") in such a manner as, individually
or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have an Earlychildhood Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule,
each Earlychildhood Material Contract that has not expired by its terms is in
full force and effect, except for those contracts, the ineffectiveness of which
would not reasonably be likely to have an Earlychildhood Material Adverse Effect
and, if all of the consents, approvals, authorizations, filings, notifications

Disclosure Schedule are obtained, taken or made, as applicable, such contract
will continue, after the Effective Time, to be in full force and effect on

Subsidiaries in the future.

Subsidiaries' products or services, nor has Earlychildhood or any of its

ownership or control, that accounted for a material percentage of the aggregate
supplies purchased by Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1,
1999.

                     (iv)  each Earlychildhood Employee Plan that is intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust established pursuant to
each such Earlychildhood Employee Plan that is intended to qualify under Section

Earlychildhood could be subject to any liability that is reasonably likely to
have an Earlychildhood Material Adverse Effect under ERISA, the Code or any
other applicable law.

      (e)   Earlychildhood is not a party to any written or oral contract,

with respect thereto) which such person may become subject to under

                                       26
<PAGE>

      (f)   Except as set forth on the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule, and
except as provided for in this Agreement, neither Earlychildhood nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written (i) agreement with any officer or

by this Agreement, (ii) agreement with any officer of Earlychildhood providing
any term of employment or compensation guarantee extending for a period longer

plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase
plan, any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the
benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits
of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any
of the Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereunder or thereunder will trigger any "change of control" or
similar provisions resulting in the acceleration of benefits or compensation
with respect to any agreements with any officer or other key employee of
Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries except for such applicable agreements
as set forth on the Earlychildhood Disclosure Schedule (the "Earlychildhood
Change of Control Agreements").

failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance, regulation, rule or order of
any Governmental Entity, or any judgment, decree or order of any court,
applicable to it, its business or operations or by which it, its business or
operations are bound, except for any such violations or failures to comply that,
individually or in the aggregate have not had and are not reasonably likely to
have an Earlychildhood Material Adverse Effect;

      (b)   No investigation or review by any Governmental Entity is pending or,
to the knowledge of Earlychildhood, has been threatened against Earlychildhood

conduct an investigation of Earlychildhood or any of its Subsidiaries; and

      (c)   There is no agreement, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding

Earlychildhood's business as currently conducted or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

      (a)   To the knowledge of Earlychildhood, none of Earlychildhood, any of
its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (as defined in Section 5.13) and any
holders of LLC Interests have taken or agreed to take any action (or failed to
take or agreed not to take any action) which such action or inaction, as the
case may be, would prevent (i) the Contribution from constituting a transaction
qualifying as a transfer of property to Holdings by the holders of LLC Interests
under Section 351 of the Code or (ii) the SmarterKids Merger as qualifying as a
reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code.

Effect. All premiums and other payments due from Earlychildhood or any

                                  ARTICLE IV.
                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SMARTERKIDS

      SmarterKids represents and warrants to Earlychildhood that the statements
contained in this Article IV are true and correct, except as set forth herein
and in the disclosure schedules delivered by SmarterKids to Earlychildhood on or
before the date of this Agreement (the "SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule").  The
SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to
the numbered and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article IV and the
disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify other paragraphs in this Article IV
only to the

                                       29
<PAGE>

extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it
also qualifies or applies to such other paragraphs.

      Section 4.1    Organization of SmarterKids. SmarterKids is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, has all requisite corporate power to own, lease and operate
its property and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed
to be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so
qualified would have a SmarterKids Material Adverse Effect (as defined below).
SmarterKids does not have, and, since the date of its incorporation, has not had
any Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on the SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule or
in the SmarterKids SEC Reports (as defined in Section 4.4) filed prior to the
date hereof, SmarterKids does not directly or indirectly own any equity or
similar interest in, or any interest that is mandatorily convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or
other business association or entity. A true, correct and complete copy of the
Certificate of Incorporation and other similar organizational documents of
SmarterKids has been delivered to Earlychildhood. For purposes of this Agreement
"SmarterKids Material Adverse Effect" shall mean a material adverse effect on
the business, assets, properties, financial condition or results of operations
of SmarterKids, provided, that a decrease or successive decreases in the market
price of the SmarterKids Common Stock prior to the Effective Time shall not, in
and of itself, constitute a SmarterKids Material Adverse Effect (it being
understood that any decrease or successive decreases in market price may be
indicative of other factors which, in and of themselves (without giving effect
to such decrease(s) in market price), would and, to the extent applicable, shall
constitute a SmarterKids Material Adverse Effect).

      Section 4.2    SmarterKids Capital Structure.

      (a)   The authorized capital stock of SmarterKids consists of 90,000,000
shares of SmarterKids Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,

20,651,115 shares of SmarterKids Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all
of which are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, (ii) no shares of
SmarterKids Common Stock were held in the treasury of SmarterKids and (iii) no

outstanding as of the date hereof, the plans under which such options were
granted and award agreements pursuant to which "non-plan" options were granted
(collectively, the "SmarterKids Stock Plans"), and the entities or persons to
whom such options were granted. As of the date hereof, warrants to purchase an
aggregate of 217,292 shares of SmarterKids Common Stock were issued and
outstanding the ("SmarterKids Warrants"). The SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule
sets forth the SmarterKids agreements under which the SmarterKids Warrants were
issued and to whom such warrants were granted. Except as set forth on the
SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule, there are no obligations, contingent or
otherwise, of SmarterKids to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares
of SmarterKids Common Stock or make any material investment (in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any other entity. A maximum of

SmarterKids Employee Stock

                                       30
<PAGE>

Purchase Plan, of which 40,666 shares have been purchased pursuant thereto as of
the date hereof.

      (b)   Except as set forth in this Section 4.2 or as reserved for future
grants of options under the SmarterKids Stock Plans or as disclosed on the
SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule, (i) there are no equity securities of any class
of SmarterKids, or any security exchangeable into or exercisable for such equity
securities, issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding; (ii) there are no
options, warrants, equity securities, calls, rights, commitments or agreements
of any character to which SmarterKids is a party or by which it is bound
obligating SmarterKids to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of SmarterKids or
obligating SmarterKids to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of or enter into
any such option, warrant, equity security, call, right, commitment or agreement;
and (iii) to the knowledge of SmarterKids, there are no voting trusts, proxies
or other voting agreements or understandings with respect to the shares of
capital stock of SmarterKids.

      Section 4.3    Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

      (a)   SmarterKids has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party
and to consummate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each of
the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and each of the Transactions Documents to which it is a party and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each of
the Transaction Documents to which it is a party by SmarterKids have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of SmarterKids, subject
only to the approval and adoption of this Agreement by SmarterKids' stockholders
under the DGCL. The stockholders of SmarterKids identified on the SmarterKids
Disclosure Schedule have each executed and delivered the Stockholder Support
Agreement in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto and assuming the due
authorization and execution of the Stockholder Support Agreement by each such
stockholder, the Stockholder Support Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of such stockholders, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. This Agreement and each of the
Transaction Documents to which SmarterKids is a party have been duly executed
and delivered by SmarterKids and constitute the valid and binding obligations of
SmarterKids, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

      (b)   Except as set forth on the SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents
to which it is a party by SmarterKids does not, and the consummation of the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each of the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws of SmarterKids (the "SmarterKids Organizational Documents"), (ii) result
in any violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) a default (or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, or
require a consent or waiver under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement,
instrument or obligation to which SmarterKids is a party or by which it or any
of its properties or assets may

                                       31
<PAGE>

be bound, or (iii) conflict with or violate any permit, concession, franchise,
license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to SmarterKids or any of its properties or assets, except in the case
of (ii) and (iii) for any such conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations,
cancellations or accelerations which are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a SmarterKids Material Adverse Effect. The execution
and delivery of the Stockholder Support Agreement by the stockholders of
SmarterKids party thereto does not conflict with, and will not result in any
violation or breach of, any provision of SmarterKids Organizational Documents.

      (c)   No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by or with
respect to SmarterKids in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or the
consummation of the Transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (i)
the filing of the pre-merger notification report under the HSR Act, if
applicable, (ii) the filing of a Certificate of Merger with respect to the
SmarterKids Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, (iii) the filing of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC in accordance with the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (iv) such consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as
may be required under applicable state or foreign securities laws, and (v) such
other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations which, if
not obtained or made, would not be reasonably likely to have a SmarterKids
Material Adverse Effect. SmarterKids is its own "ultimate parent entity" (as
such term is used in the HSR Act and the Regulations thereunder) and is not a
"$100 million Person" within the meaning of the HSR Act and the Regulations
thereunder.

      Section 4.4    SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

      (a)   SmarterKids has timely filed and made available to Earlychildhood
all forms, reports and documents filed or required to be filed by SmarterKids
with the SEC since the date of its initial public offering (collectively, the
"SmarterKids SEC Reports"). The SmarterKids SEC Reports (including all exhibits
and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) (i) at
the time filed, complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
(ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a
filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated in such SmarterKids SEC Reports or necessary in order to
make the statements in such SmarterKids SEC Reports, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

      (b)   SmarterKids will deliver to Earlychildhood as soon as they become
available true and complete copies of any report or statement mailed by
SmarterKids to its security holders generally or filed by it with the SEC, in
each case subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. As of
their respective dates, such reports and statements (excluding any information
therein provided by Earlychildhood, as to which SmarterKids makes no
representation) will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading and will comply in all material

                                       32
<PAGE>

respects with all applicable requirements of law. The audited financial
statements and unaudited interim financial statements of SmarterKids to be
included or incorporated by reference in such reports and statements will be
prepared in accordance with GAAP and regulations of the SEC applicable to public
companies and will fairly present the financial position of SmarterKids as of
the dates thereof and the results of operations and consolidated cash flows for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of any unaudited interim financial
statements, to normal year-end adjustments and to the extent they may not
include footnotes or may be condensed or summary statements).

      (c)   Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any
related notes) contained in the SmarterKids SEC Reports complied as to form in
all material respects with the applicable published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with GAAP and regulations
of the SEC applicable to public companies applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such
financial statements or, in the case of unaudited statements, in conformity with
the requirements of Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) and fairly presented in
all material respects the financial position of SmarterKids as of the respective
dates and the results of its operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are
subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not
expected to be material in amount. The unaudited balance sheet of SmarterKids as
of September 30, 2000 is referred to herein as the "SmarterKids Balance Sheet."
No financial statements of any other entity are required to be included in the
financial statements of SmarterKids under GAAP.

      Section 4.5    No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed in the
SmarterKids SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or on the SmarterKids
Disclosure Schedule, and except for normal or recurring liabilities incurred
since the date of the SmarterKids Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices, SmarterKids does not have any
liabilities, either accrued, contingent or otherwise (whether or not required to
be reflected in financial statements in accordance with GAAP), and whether due
or to become due, which individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely
to have a SmarterKids Material Adverse Effect.

      Section 4.6    Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents or as disclosed in
the SmarterKids SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth on
the SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule, since the date of the SmarterKids Balance
Sheet, SmarterKids has conducted its businesses only in the ordinary course and
in a manner consistent with past practice and, since such date, there has been
no material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations,
business, assets or properties of SmarterKids (a "SmarterKids Material Adverse

such payments)) or entry into any employment, severance or similar contract with
any such person;

       (d)  adoption of any Employee Benefit Plan or Benefit Arrangement for or
with any employees of SmarterKids or any SmarterKids ERISA Affiliate or any

<PAGE>

      (l)   agreement, whether oral or written, by SmarterKids with respect to
or to do any of the foregoing;

      (m)   other action or event that would have required the consent of
Earlychildhood pursuant to Section 5.1 of this Agreement had such action or
event occurred after the date of this Agreement and that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a SmarterKids Material
Adverse Effect.

      Section 4.7    Taxes.

      (a)   SmarterKids has (i) timely filed all federal, state, local and
foreign Tax returns and reports required to be filed by it prior to the date of
this Agreement (taking into account all applicable extensions) and such Tax
returns are accurate and complete in all material respects, (ii) timely paid or
accrued all Taxes owed (whether or not shown on any Tax returns), and (iii) paid
or accrued all Taxes for which a notice of assessment or collection has been
received (other than amounts being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings). None of the Tax returns filed or Taxes payable by SmarterKids have
been the subject of an audit, action, suit, proceeding, claim, examination,
deficiency or assessment by the IRS or any other governmental authority, and no
such audit, action, suit, proceeding, claim, examination, deficiency or
assessment is currently pending or, to the knowledge of SmarterKids,
contemplated or threatened. The unpaid Taxes of SmarterKids (whether or not yet
payable) attributable to any period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date did not, as of September 30, 2000, exceed the reserve for actual
Taxes (as opposed to any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) as shown on the SmarterKids
Balance Sheet, and will not exceed such reserve as adjusted for the passage of
time through the Closing Date in accordance with the reasonable past custom and
practice of SmarterKids in filing its Tax returns. SmarterKids will not incur
any liability for Taxes from September 30, 2000 through the Closing Date other
than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with reasonable past
practice, and will not incur any Tax liability in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. SmarterKids has not agreed to make
any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code (or any corresponding provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law) by reason of a change in accounting method
or otherwise, and SmarterKids will not be required to make any such adjustment
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. SmarterKids has
timely withheld or collected and paid over to the appropriate governmental
authorities (or is properly holding for such timely payment) all Taxes required
by law to be withheld or collected. SmarterKids has not made an election under
Section 341(f) of the Code. There are no liens for Taxes upon the assets of
SmarterKids (other than liens for Taxes that are not yet due or that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings). No extension of a statute
of limitations relating to any Taxes is in effect with respect to SmarterKids.

      (b)   SmarterKids has not been a member of an affiliated group of
corporations filing a consolidated federal income tax return (or a group of
corporations filing a consolidated, combined or unitary income tax return under
comparable provisions of state, local or foreign tax law) for any taxable
period, other than a group the common parent of which is or was SmarterKids.
SmarterKids has not been and is not a party to or member of any joint venture,
partnership, limited liability company, or other arrangement or contract which
could be treated as

                                       35
<PAGE>

a partnership for federal income tax purposes. SmarterKids is not, and has not
been, a U.S. real property holding corporation (as defined in Section 897(c)(2)
of the Code) during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii)
of the Code.

      (c)   SmarterKids has no obligation under any agreement or arrangement
with any other person or any provision of law with respect to Taxes of such
other person (including pursuant to Treas. Reg. (S) 1.1502-6 or comparable
provisions of state, local or foreign tax law) and including any liability for
Taxes of any predecessor entity.

      Section 4.8    Properties.

      (a)   The SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all
material leases to which SmarterKids is a party as a lessee as of the date
hereof (the "SmarterKids Lease Agreements"), setting forth in the case of any
such lease covering real property, the location of such real property. To the
knowledge of SmarterKids, SmarterKids has a valid and binding leasehold interest
in each of the properties that is the subject of a SmarterKids Lease Agreement
free and clear of all Encumbrances except for (i) any Encumbrances reflected in
the financial statements included in the SmarterKids SEC Reports and the
SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule; (ii) any Encumbrances which, individually or in
the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a SmarterKids Material Adverse
Effect; (iii) zoning laws and other land use restrictions that do not impair the
present or anticipated use or occupancy of the property subject thereto, (iv)
any Encumbrances for taxes, assessments and other governmental charges not yet
due and payable or due but not delinquent or due and being contested in good
faith; (v) any mechanics' workmen's, repairmen's, warehousemen's, carrier's or
other similar liens and encumbrances arising in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice or being contested in good faith and (vi) any
Encumbrances which are matters of public record or are shown by a current title
report and reflected on the SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule (clauses (i) through
(vi) above collectively referred to herein as "SmarterKids Permitted
Encumbrances").

     (b)    SmarterKids is not in default under any SmarterKids Lease Agreement
except where the existence of such defaults, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a SmarterKids Material Adverse
Effect.

     (c)    SmarterKids does not own any real property.

     Section 4.9     Intellectual Property.

     (a)    SmarterKids owns free and clear of all Encumbrances or is licensed
or otherwise possesses legally enforceable rights to use all patents,
trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, and any applications for
such patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, know-how,
computer software programs or applications and tangible or intangible
proprietary information or material that are necessary to conduct the business
of SmarterKids as currently conducted (the "SmarterKids Intellectual Property"),
subject to such exceptions that would not be reasonably likely to have an
SmarterKids Material Adverse Effect. The SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule
contains a list of all of the following that are included in the material within
the SmarterKids Intellectual Property: (i) patents and patent applications; (ii)
trademarks, trade names and service marks and registrations thereof and
applications

                                       36

therefor; and (iii) registered copyrights and applications therefor. The
SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule identifies the owner of each item listed thereon
and, in the case of registrations and applications, the application or
registration number and date.

      (b)   To the knowledge of SmarterKids, SmarterKids is the sole and
exclusive owner or a licensee of all of the material SmarterKids Intellectual
Property. All of the material SmarterKids Intellectual Property will be owned or
available for use by SmarterKids on terms and conditions immediately following
the Effective Time identical to the terms and conditions pertaining to
SmarterKids immediately prior to the Effective Time. SmarterKids has taken
reasonable measures to protect the proprietary nature of the SmarterKids
Intellectual Property and to maintain in confidence the trade secrets and
confidential information that they own or use. No other person has any rights to
any material item of the SmarterKids Intellectual Property or has any rights to
any of the material SmarterKids Intellectual Property, except that the items of
the SmarterKids Intellectual Property identified on the SmarterKids Disclosure
Schedule as licensed to SmarterKids are owned by the respective owners
identified on the SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule, and, to the knowledge of
SmarterKids, no person is infringing, violating or misappropriating any of the
material SmarterKids Intellectual Property.

      (c)   To the knowledge of SmarterKids, none of the activities or business
presently conducted by SmarterKids infringes or violates, or constitutes a
misappropriation of, any intellectual property of any other person, and, if
without the knowledge of SmarterKids, such activities or business presently
conducted by SmarterKids does infringe, violate or constitute a misappropriation
of any intellectual property of any other person, no such infringement,
violation or misappropriation, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably
likely to have a SmarterKids Material Adverse Effect. Neither SmarterKids nor
any Affiliate of SmarterKids has received any complaint, claim or notice
alleging any such infringement, violation or misappropriation.

SmarterKids Employee Plan and there has been no amendment to, written
interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by SmarterKids or any

employee of SmarterKids except for such applicable agreements as set forth on
the SmarterKids Disclosure Schedule (the "SmarterKids Change of Control
Agreements").

(as defined in Section 5.13) and any of SmarterKids' stockholders have taken or

<PAGE>

described in Section 368(a) of the Code and, (ii) taken together with the

of ongoing operations and shall promptly provide the other party or its counsel
with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity and,

commercially reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing Date, any event,
transaction or circumstance, as soon as practical after it becomes known to such
party, that causes or will cause any covenant or agreement of Earlychildhood or

the Closing Date, any violation or breach, as soon as practical after it becomes
known to such party, of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made
by Earlychildhood or SmarterKids. No notice given pursuant to this paragraph
shall have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction
of any condition contained herein.

      Section 5.3    No Solicitation.

      (a) Subject to Section 5.3(b), unless and until this Agreement shall have
been terminated by SmarterKids or Earlychildhood pursuant to and in compliance
with Article VII hereof, SmarterKids shall not, nor will it authorize or permit
any of its officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants, or other representatives or agents to, directly or indirectly
through another person (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage any
inquiries, offers or proposals by or from any Third Party (as defined below)
that constitute, or

                                       48
<PAGE>

could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined
below), (ii) enter into or execute any agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) engage in or continue negotiations or discussions with any Third
Party concerning, or, except pursuant to a governmental request for information,
otherwise communicate or provide any non-public information to any Third Party
relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) make or authorize any public
statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition
Proposal, or (v) take any other action inconsistent with its obligations or
commitments under this Section 5.3. As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition
Proposal" means any (i) transaction pursuant to which any corporation,
partnership, trust, person or other entity or group other than Earlychildhood or
its Affiliates (a "Third Party"), acquires more than 20% of the outstanding
shares of SmarterKids Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer
or otherwise, (ii) merger or other business combination, recapitalization,
restructuring or similar transaction involving SmarterKids, (iii) other
transaction pursuant to which any Third Party acquires control of assets of
SmarterKids having a fair market value equal to more than 20% of the fair market
value of all the assets of SmarterKids immediately prior to such transaction, or
(iv) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to do any of the
foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

      (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, SmarterKids may, and may authorize and
permit its officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants and other representatives or agents, in response to a bona fide,
written, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party which did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.3, to (i) furnish non-public
information to such Third Party; (ii) otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt
by such Third Party to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) agree to
or recommend or endorse any such Acquisition Proposal with or by any Third
Party; (iv) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Earlychildhood, its approval and recommendation of the
SmarterKids Merger and this Agreement; (v) participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Third Party relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and
(vi) cause SmarterKids to enter into an agreement implementing an Acquisition
Proposal, provided that SmarterKids simultaneously terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(f) and pays the Termination Fee (as defined in Section
7.3); provided, however, that SmarterKids shall be permitted to take any one or
more of the actions enumerated in clauses (i)-(vi) above if and only to the
extent that (A) the Board of Directors of SmarterKids reasonably determines in
good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that (X) the Acquisition Proposal is more favorable or is reasonably
likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal that is more favorable to the
SmarterKids stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions,
and (Y) is made by a Third Party reasonably believed by the SmarterKids Board of
Directors to be financially capable of completing such Acquisition Proposal, (B)
the SmarterKids Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith (after
having consulted with and considered the advice of its outside legal counsel)
that the failure to take such actions would cause the members of the SmarterKids
Board of Directors to breach their fiduciary duties to the SmarterKids
stockholders under applicable law, and (C) prior to furnishing or disclosing any
non-public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
such Third Party, it receives from such Third Party an executed confidentiality
agreement with respect to the information to be furnished with terms no less
favorable in the aggregate to it than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement dated as of January 19, 2000 by and between

                                       49
<PAGE>

Earlychildhood and SmarterKids (the "Earlychildhood Confidentiality Agreement"),
but which confidentiality agreement shall not (nor shall any other agreement or
arrangement between SmarterKids, on the one hand, and such Third Party, on the
other hand, or any of their respective representatives or agents) provide for
any exclusive right to negotiate with SmarterKids or any payments by
SmarterKids. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3(b) by any officer, director or
employee of SmarterKids or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other
advisor, representative or agent of SmarterKids shall be deemed to be a breach
of this Section 5.3 by SmarterKids.

      (c) SmarterKids shall (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or similar transaction, and
take all necessary steps to inform such individuals or entities of the
obligations undertaken in this Section 5.3, (ii) as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Earlychildhood in writing of
any Acquisition Proposal or receipt of any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information
relating to it in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to its
properties, books or records by any Third Party that informs SmarterKids' Board
of Directors or any representative thereof that it is considering making, or has
made (or which SmarterKids' Board of Directors reasonably believes may be
considering making or has made) a proposal or offer with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) in such written notice, indicate in reasonable
detail the identity of such Third Party (including the name of such Third Party
and a copy of any offer or proposal and any supporting documentation) and the
terms and conditions of such proposal or offer, all of which information shall
be held in confidence by Earlychildhood, and (iv) as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Earlychildhood in
writing of any determination by its Board of Directors to furnish information or
engage in discussions or negotiations with any Third Party. SmarterKids shall
promptly furnish to Earlychildhood copies of any written information (and advise
it orally of any non-written information) provided to or by any Third Party
relating to an Acquisition Proposal to the extent such information has not
previously been provided to Earlychildhood. If any notice is given or required
to be given in accordance with the second preceding sentence, then SmarterKids
shall thereafter continue to keep Earlychildhood informed, on a current basis,
of the status of any such discussions or negotiations and the terms being
discussed or negotiated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SmarterKids shall not
accept or enter into any agreement concerning an Acquisition Proposal for a
period of at least three business days after Earlychildhood's receipt of the
notification of the terms thereof pursuant to the third preceding sentence (and
only in compliance with the terms of Article VII hereof).

      (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit SmarterKids from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the SmarterKids Board of Directors reasonably determines in good
faith after receiving the advice of its outside legal counsel (who may be its
regularly engaged outside counsel) that the failure to do so would cause the
members of the SmarterKids Board of Directors to breach of their fiduciary
duties to the SmarterKids stockholders under any applicable law, provided,
however, that neither SmarterKids nor the SmarterKids Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof may, except as expressly permitted by Section 5.3(b) or
required by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, withdraw or modify,
or propose publicly to

                                       50
<PAGE>

withdraw or modify, its position with respect to this Agreement or the
SmarterKids Merger or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal.

      Section 5.4    No Negotiation.

      (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, or unless this
Agreement is earlier terminated by SmarterKids or Earlychildhood pursuant to and
in compliance with Article VII, Earlychildhood shall not and shall not permit
its Subsidiaries nor any of its Members or any of their respective Affiliates,
nor will Earlychildhood authorize or permit any of its employees, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants, or other representatives or agents to,
directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate
or encourage any inquiries, offers or proposals by or from any Other Party (as
defined below) that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Earlychildhood Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii) enter into or
execute any agreement with respect to an Earlychildhood Acquisition Proposal,

concerning, or, except pursuant to a governmental request for information,
otherwise communicate or provide any non-public information to any Other Party
relating to, any Earlychildhood Acquisition Proposal, (iv) make or authorize any
public statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any
Earlychildhood Acquisition Proposal, or (v) take any other action inconsistent
with its obligations or commitments under this Section 5.4. As used in this
Agreement, "Earlychildhood Acquisition Proposal" means any (i) transaction
pursuant to which any corporation, partnership, trust, person or other entity or
group other than SmarterKids or its Affiliates (an "Other Party"), acquires more
than 20% of the outstanding LLC Interests, (ii) merger or other business
combination, recapitalization, restructuring or similar transaction involving
Earlychildhood, (iii) other transaction pursuant to which any Other Party
acquires control of assets of Earlychildhood having a fair market value equal to
more than 20% of the fair market value of all the assets of Earlychildhood
immediately prior to such transaction, or (iv) any public announcement of a
proposal, plan or intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to
engage in any of the foregoing.

      (b) Earlychildhood shall (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Earlychildhood Acquisition Proposal or similar
transaction, and take all necessary steps to inform such individuals or entities
of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.4, (ii) as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify SmarterKids
in writing of receipt of any Earlychildhood Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Earlychildhood Acquisition
Proposal or any request for nonpublic information relating to it in connection
with an Earlychildhood Acquisition Proposal or for access to its properties,
books or records by any Other Party that informs Earlychildhood's Management
Committee or any officer of Earlychildhood that is its considering making, or
has made (or which Earlychildhood's Management Committee reasonably believes may
be considering making or has made) a proposal or offer with respect to an
Earlychildhood Acquisition Proposal, (iii) in such written notice indicate in
reasonable detail the identity of such Other Party (including the name of such
Other Party and a copy of any offer or proposal and any supporting
documentation) and the terms and conditions of such proposal or offer, all of
which

                                       51
<PAGE>

information shall be held in confidence by SmarterKids, and (iv) as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify
SmarterKids in writing of any determination by Earlychildhood's Management
Committee or its officers or Affiliates to furnish information or engage in
discussions or negotiations with any Other Party, it being understood that if
Earlychildhood furnishes such information or engages in discussions or
negotiations without SmarterKids' prior written consent, it shall constitute a
breach of this Agreement. During such period, neither the Earlychildhood
Management Committee nor any subcommittee thereof will approve or enter into any
agreement to initiate, facilitate, encourage or implement an Earlychildhood
Acquisition Proposal, or take any other action to contravene, supersede or
modify their approval of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the
Contribution or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

      Section 5.5    Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement.

      (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
SmarterKids shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and Earlychildhood and SmarterKids will cause Holdings to prepare and file with
the SEC the Registration Statement on Form S-4 in which the Proxy

reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective as
soon after such filing as practical and to keep such Registration Statement
effective for so long as is necessary to consummate the Contribution and the
SmarterKids Merger. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of SmarterKids in favor of this
Agreement and the SmarterKids Merger; provided that the Board of Directors of

Earlychildhood and SmarterKids shall each (and Earlychildhood shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, managers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other authorized representatives of the other, access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
personnel, properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during
such period, each of Earlychildhood and SmarterKids shall (and Earlychildhood
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other (a) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other

                                       52
<PAGE>

Earlychildhood and Thomas Weisel Partners (the "SmarterKids Confidentiality
Agreement", and together with the Earlychildhood Confidentiality Agreement, the
"Confidentiality Agreements"). No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the Contribution or the SmarterKids
Merger.

      Section 5.8    SmarterKids Stockholders' Meeting. SmarterKids shall call a
meeting of its stockholders to be held as promptly as practicable for the
purpose of voting upon this Agreement and the SmarterKids Merger. Subject to
Section 5.3, SmarterKids shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its
stockholders approval of such matters and shall coordinate and cooperate with
Earlychildhood with respect to the timing of such meeting and shall use its best
efforts to hold such meeting as soon as practicable after the date hereof. The
only matters SmarterKids shall propose to be acted on by its stockholders at the
stockholders' meeting shall be the approval of this Agreement and the
SmarterKids Merger and related matters incidental to the consummation of the
SmarterKids Merger. Unless otherwise required to comply with the fiduciary
duties of SmarterKids' Board of Directors, as determined by such directors in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel, SmarterKids shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in
favor of such matters including the retention of a proxy solicitation firm.

      (a)  Earlychildhood and SmarterKids shall each use all reasonable efforts
to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary and proper under applicable law to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable,
(ii) obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any consents,
licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be
obtained or made by Earlychildhood or SmarterKids (and in the case of

execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby including, without limitation, the Contribution
and the SmarterKids Merger, (iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary

state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act, if applicable, and (C) any other
applicable law, and (iv) refrain from taking any actions (other than as
expressly permitted under Sections 5.3 or 5.4) which would reasonably be likely

Earlychildhood and SmarterKids shall cooperate with each other in connection
with the making of all such filings, including

                                       53

providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors
prior to filing and, if requested, to accept all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested in connection therewith.

      (b)  Earlychildhood and SmarterKids agree, and Earlychildhood shall cause
 each of its Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their respective best efforts
to obtain any government clearances required for Closing (including through
compliance with the HSR Act), to respond to any government requests for
information, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) (an "Order") that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other federal, state or
foreign antitrust or fair trade law. Earlychildhood and SmarterKids shall
cooperate and work together in any proceedings or negotiations with any
Governmental Entity relating to any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 5.9, neither Earlychildhood nor SmarterKids
shall be required to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
substantially impair the overall benefits expected, as of the date hereof, to be
realized from the consummation of the Transactions.

      (c)  Each of Earlychildhood and SmarterKids shall give any notices to
third parties, and shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain any third party

agree on the form and content of the initial press release regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereafter shall consult with each other

or other public statement with respect to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by law.

      Section 5.12   Non-recognition Exchange. Whether before or after the
Effective Time, none of Earlychildhood, SmarterKids, their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates and Holdings shall knowingly take any action, or
knowingly fail to take any action, that is reasonably likely to jeopardize the
treatment of the SmarterKids Merger and the Contribution as transfers of
property

                                       54
<PAGE>

described in Section 351 of the Code or the SmarterKids Merger as a
reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code.

      Section 5.13   Affiliate Agreements. Upon the execution of this Agreement,
Earlychildhood and SmarterKids will provide each other with a list of those
persons who are, in Earlychildhood's or SmarterKids' respective reasonable
judgment, "affiliates" of Earlychildhood or SmarterKids, as the case may be,
within the meaning of Rule 145 (each such person who is an "affiliate" of
Earlychildhood or SmarterKids within the meaning of Rule 145 is referred to as
an "Affiliate") promulgated under the Securities Act ("Rule 145").
Earlychildhood and SmarterKids shall provide each other such information and
documents as the other party shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing
such list and shall notify the other party in writing regarding any change in
the identity of its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date. Earlychildhood and
SmarterKids shall each use all reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered to each other by November 30, 2000 (and in any case prior to the
Effective Time) from each of its Affiliates, an executed Affiliate Agreement,
substantially similar to the form attached hereto as Exhibit J, by which each
Affiliate of Earlychildhood and each Affiliate of SmarterKids agrees to comply
with the applicable requirements of Rule 145 (an "Affiliate Agreement").
Holdings shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates
evidencing any Holdings Common Stock to be received by such Affiliates of
Earlychildhood or SmarterKids pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to
issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for Holdings
Common Stock, consistent with the terms of the Affiliate Agreements (provided
that such legends or stop transfer instructions shall be removed, when such
shares of Holdings Common Stock are generally transferable without any
restrictions imposed by Rule 145, upon the request of any stockholder that is
not then an Affiliate of Holdings).

      Section 5.14   Nasdaq Quotation. Earlychildhood and SmarterKids shall
cause Holdings to promptly prepare and submit an application to Nasdaq to quote
the shares of Holdings Common Stock to be issued in the Transactions and upon
exercise or conversion of the Earlychildhood Options, the SmarterKids Stock
Options and the SmarterKids Warrants, and shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause such shares to be approved for quotation on Nasdaq, prior to the Effective
Time, subject to official notice of issuance.

      Section 5.15   Stock Plans.

      (a)   At the Effective Time, each outstanding Earlychildhood Option under
the Earlychildhood Option Plans and each outstanding SmarterKids Stock Option
under the SmarterKids Stock Plans, in each case whether vested or unvested,
shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, in the case of
Earlychildhood, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Earlychildhood Option and, in the case of SmarterKids, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such SmarterKids Stock
Option, the same number of shares of Holdings Common Stock as the holder of such
Earlychildhood Option or SmarterKids Stock Option, as the case may be, would
have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Contribution or the SmarterKids
Merger, respectively, had such holder exercised such option in full immediately
prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole number), at a
price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (y) the
aggregate exercise price for the LLC Interests or shares of SmarterKids Common
Stock, as the case may be, purchasable

                                       55
<PAGE>

pursuant to such Earlychildhood Option or such SmarterKids Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (z) the number of full shares
of Holdings Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such Earlychildhood
Option or SmarterKids Stock Option, as the case may be, in accordance with the
foregoing. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Earlychildhood and SmarterKids
shall make any such adjustments to the terms of the Earlychildhood Option Plans
or SmarterKids Stock Plans as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions
of this Section 5.15.

      (b)   As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Holdings shall
