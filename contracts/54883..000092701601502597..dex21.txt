                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of August
20, 2001, is entered into by and among Keane, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation
(the "Buyer"), Veritas Acquisition Corp., a Virginia corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary"), and Metro
Information Services, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the "Company").

     WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Buyer and the Company deem it
advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and their respective
shareholders that the Buyer acquire the Company in order to advance the long-
term business interests of the Buyer and the Company;

     WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger
(the "Merger") of the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including the Plan of Merger
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Plan of Merger"), and the Virginia Stock
Corporation Act (the "VSCA"), as a result of which the Company shall become a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer;

     WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to the Buyer's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, John H. Fain has entered into a Shareholder's Agreement, dated as of
the date of this Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"Shareholder's Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, such
shareholder has agreed to give the Buyer a proxy to vote a certain number of the
shares of capital stock of the Company that such shareholder owns in favor of
the Merger; and

     WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the Company agree as follows:

                                   THE MERGER

     1.1 Effective Time of the Merger. Subject to the provisions of this

Surviving Corporation in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the VSCA
and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the VSCA. The
Merger shall become effective upon the issuance of the Certificate of Merger by

     1.3 Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence
         ---------------------
of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Transitory Subsidiary shall be
merged with and into the Company (the Transitory Subsidiary and the Company are
sometimes referred to herein as the "Constituent Corporations," and the Company
following the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving
Corporation"), (b) the Articles of Incorporation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to be identical to the
Articles of Incorporation of the Transitory Subsidiary as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time except that all references to the name of the

as so amended, such Articles of Incorporation shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance
with the VSCA, and (c) the Bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be amended to be identical to the Bylaws of the
Transitory Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
except that all references to the name of the Transitory Subsidiary shall be

                                  ARTICLE II

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary:

        (a)  Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary. Each share of the
             ------------------------------------------
common stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid

                                       2
<PAGE>

and nonassessable share of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

        (b)  Cancellation of Buyer-Owned Stock. All shares of common stock,
             ---------------------------------
$0.01 par value per share, of the Company, including all shares of Nonvoting
Common Stock ("Company Common Stock"), that are owned by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist and no stock of the Buyer or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

        (c)  Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.2, each
             ----------------------------------
share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 2.1(b)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 0.48 shares (the
"Exchange Ratio") of common stock, $0.10 par value per share, of the Buyer
("Buyer Common Stock") upon surrender of the certificate representing such share
of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.2. As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2, without interest.

     (d)  Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. In the event of any reclassification,
          -----------------------------
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Buyer Common Stock or Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date
is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the
Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect fully such event.

     (e) Unvested Stock. At the Effective Time, any shares of Buyer Common Stock
         --------------
issued in accordance with Section 2.1(c) with respect to any unvested shares of
Company Common Stock awarded to employees, directors, advisors or consultants
pursuant to any of the Company's plans or arrangements and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into unvested shares
of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with the Exchange Ratio and shall remain
subject to the same terms, restrictions and vesting schedule as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent by their terms
such unvested shares of Company Common Stock vest at the Effective Time. The
Company shall not take or permit any action which would accelerate vesting of
any unvested shares, except to the extent required by their terms as in effect
on the date hereof. Copies of the relevant agreements governing such shares and
the vesting thereof have been provided to the Buyer. All outstanding rights
which the Company may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to repurchase

                                       3
<PAGE>

unvested shares of Company Common Stock shall be assigned to the Buyer in the
Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by the Buyer upon the same terms and
conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the
shares purchasable pursuant to such rights and the purchase price payable per
share shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio. The Company
shall take all steps necessary to cause the foregoing provisions of this Section
2.1(e) to occur.

          (f) Treatment of Company Stock Options. Following the Effective Time,
              ----------------------------------
Company Stock Options shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section 6.12.

     2.2 Exchange of Certificates. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
         ------------------------
shares of Company Common Stock for shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:

        (a) Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit
            --------------
with EquiServe LP or another bank or trust company designated by the Buyer and
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders
of shares of the Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing that
number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the aggregate number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (ii) cash in
an amount sufficient to make payments for fractional shares required pursuant to
Section 2.2(e) and (iii) any dividends or distributions to which holders of
shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). The
shares of Buyer Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to
clause (i) above, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto with a record date after the Effective Time, and the cash deposited
pursuant to clause (ii) above being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund."

        (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
            -------------------
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock (the "Certificates")
whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive
shares of Buyer Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Buyer may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for shares of Buyer Common Stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional
shares, if any, of Buyer Common Stock and any dividends or distributions as
provided below). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the
Buyer, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock which
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (B) cash in an
amount sufficient to make payments for fractional shares pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.2(e) and (C) any dividends or distributions pursuant to
the provisions of Section 2.2(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall

                                       4
<PAGE>

immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, (x)
a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Buyer Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (y) the proper amount of cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and (z) any dividends or
distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) may be issued or paid to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender (1) shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c),
(2) cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and (3) any
dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) as contemplated by this
Section 2.2.

        (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
            ------------------------------------------------
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Buyer Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e)
until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate.
Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be issued and paid to the record holder of the
Certificate, (i) certificates representing whole shares of Buyer Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, (ii) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously
paid with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock, without interest,
and (iii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender
and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Buyer Common Stock.

        (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of
            ---------------------------------------------------
Buyer Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof (together with any cash or dividends or other
distributions paid pursuant to Sections 2.2(c) or 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

        (e) No Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing
            --------------------
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of the Buyer.

                                       5
<PAGE>

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after
taking into account all Certificates registered in the name of or delivered by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied
by the average of the last reported sales prices per share of the Buyer Common
Stock on the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX") during the ten consecutive trading
days ending on the last trading day prior to the Closing Date.

        (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
            ----------------------------
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of
Company Common Stock who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall
thereafter look only to the Buyer, as a general unsecured creditor, for payment
of its claim for shares of Buyer Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and any dividends
or distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

        (g) No Liability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
            ------------
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
or Buyer Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares of Buyer Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of
Buyer Common Stock, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to the
holder of such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.2(e) or any dividends or
distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to Section
2.2(c), would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity), all such shares of Buyer Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional
shares or dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Buyer, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

        (h) Withholding Rights. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
            ------------------
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other
applicable provision of law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case
may be.

        (i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
            -----------------
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by

                                       6
<PAGE>

the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the shares of Buyer Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Buyer Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

        (j) Rule 145 Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
            -------------------
contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any affiliate of the Company
(within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act) (each such
person, a "Rule 145 Affiliate") shall not be exchanged until the Buyer has
received an Affiliate Agreement (as such term is defined in Section 6.10 below)
from such Rule 145 Affiliate.

                                  ARTICLE III

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     The Company represents and warrants to the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary that the statements contained in this Article III are true and
correct, except as expressly set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company to the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary on or before
the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule").  The Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding
to the numbered and lettered sections and paragraphs contained in this Article
III, and the disclosure in any section or paragraph shall qualify (1) the
corresponding section or paragraph in this Article III and (2) such other
sections and paragraphs in this Article III only to the extent that it is clear
from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such
other sections or paragraphs.

     3.1  Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.
          ----------------------------------------------

          (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted, and is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, operated or
leased or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary,
except for such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, which have not had and are not reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, event,
circumstance, development or effect that is or is reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on (i) the business, assets, liabilities,
capitalization, prospects, condition (financial or other), or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

                                       7
<PAGE>

Agreement or (iii) the ability of the Buyer to operate the business of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries immediately after the Closing; provided,
however, that for purposes of this Agreement, the following shall not be taken
into account in determining whether there has been or would be a "Company
Material Adverse Effect": (x) any adverse change in the stock price or trading
volume of the Company in and of itself, as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market,
and (y) changes or effects relating to the economy or the IT services business
as a whole not substantially disproportionately affecting the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree
that the terms "material," "materially" or "materiality" as used in this
Agreement with an initial lower case "m" shall have their respective customary
and ordinary meanings, without regard to the meaning ascribed to Company
Material Adverse Effect in the prior sentence of this paragraph.

          (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or
indirectly owns any equity, membership, partnership or similar interest in, or
any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity,
membership, partnership or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership,
joint venture, limited liability company or other business association or
entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has, at any time, been a general partner or managing member of
any general partnership, limited partnership or other entity. Section 3.1(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all
of the Company's Subsidiaries and the Company's direct or indirect equity
interest therein. As used in this Agreement, the term "Subsidiary" means, with
respect to a party, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company or other business association or entity, whether incorporated
or unincorporated, of which (i) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party
is a general partner or a managing member (excluding partnerships, the general
partnership interests of which held by such party and/or one or more of its
Subsidiaries do not have a majority of the voting interest in such partnership),
(ii) such party and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries holds voting power to
elect a majority of the board of directors or other governing body performing
similar functions, or (iii) such party and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, owns or controls more than 50% of the equity,
membership, partnership or similar interests.

          (c) The Company has made available to the Buyer complete and accurate
copies of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company and the
charter, bylaws or other organizational documents of each Subsidiary of the
Company.

     3.2  Capitalization.

(iii) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share ("Company

Company; the name of the applicable shareholder; the lapsing schedule for any
such shares, including the extent to which any such repurchase or redemption
right or right of first refusal has lapsed as of the date of this Agreement,
whether (and to what extent) the lapsing will be accelerated in any way by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by termination of employment or
change in position following consummation of the Merger; and whether such holder
has the sole power to vote and dispose of such shares.

          (b) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the number
of shares of Company Common Stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to stock
options granted and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and the plans
under which such options were granted (collectively, the "Company Stock Plans")
and sets forth a complete and accurate list of all holders of outstanding
options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (such outstanding options,
the "Company Stock Options") under the Company Stock Plans, indicating with
respect to each Company Stock Option the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, the relationship of the holder to
the Company, and the exercise price, the date of grant, vesting schedule and the
expiration date thereof, including the extent to which any vesting has occurred
as of the date of this Agreement. No Company Stock Options will be accelerated
in any way by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by termination
of employment or change in position following consummation of the Merger. The
Company has provided to the Buyer accurate and complete copies of (i) all
Company Stock Plans and (ii) the forms of all stock option agreements evidencing
all Company Stock Options.

          (c) Except (i) as set forth in this Section 3.2 and (ii) as reserved
for future grants under Company Stock Plans, (A) there are no equity securities
of any class of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than equity
securities of any such Subsidiary that are directly or indirectly owned by the
Company), or any security exchangeable into or exercisable for such equity
securities, issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding and (B) there are no
options, warrants, equity securities, calls, rights, commitments or agreements
of any character to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or

cause to be issued, exchanged, transferred, delivered or sold, additional shares
of capital stock or other equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any security or right convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any such shares or other equity interests, or obligating the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of,
otherwise modify or amend or enter into any such option, warrant, equity
security, call, right, commitment or agreement. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has outstanding any stock appreciation rights, phantom stock,
performance-based rights or similar rights or obligations.

<PAGE>

          (d) Other than the Shareholder's Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the
Securities Act) (each, an "Affiliate") is a party to or is bound by any, and to
the knowledge of the Company, there are no, agreements or understandings with
respect to the voting (including voting trusts and proxies) or sale or transfer
(including agreements imposing transfer restrictions) of any shares of capital
stock or other equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Except as contemplated by this Agreement, there are no registration rights, and
there is no rights agreement, "poison pill" anti-takeover plan or other
agreement or understanding to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which it or they are bound with respect to any equity security of
any class of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any
equity security, partnership interest or similar ownership interest of any class
of any of its Subsidiaries. Shareholders of the Company are not entitled to
dissenters' or appraisal rights under applicable state law in connection with
the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (e) All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and all shares
of Company Common Stock subject to issuance as specified in Sections 3.2(b) and
3.2(c) above, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the
instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in
violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,
preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any provision of
the VSCA, the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or any agreement to
which the Company is a party or is otherwise bound. There are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or
the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to provide funds
to or make any material investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution
or otherwise) in the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any other
entity, other than guarantees of bank obligations of Subsidiaries of the Company
entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
(the "Ordinary Course of Business").

          (f) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity
securities or interests of each of the Company's Subsidiaries are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights and all such shares (other than directors' qualifying shares in the case
of non-U.S. Subsidiaries, all of which the Company has the power to cause to be
transferred for no or nominal consideration to the Buyer or the Buyer's
designee) are owned, of record and beneficially, by the Company or another
Subsidiary of the Company free and clear of all security interests, liens,
claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in the Company's voting rights, charges
or other encumbrances of any nature.

          (g)  No consent of the holders of Company Stock Options is required in
connection with the actions contemplated by Section 6.12.

enter into this Agreement and, subject only to the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Plan of Merger (the "Company Voting Proposal") by the
Company's shareholders under the VSCA (the "Company Shareholder Approval"), to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company

of, any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or
the charter, bylaws or other organizational document of any Subsidiary of the
Company, (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or

or loss of any benefit) under, require a consent or waiver under, constitute a
change in control under, require the payment of a penalty under or result in the
imposition of any Lien on the Company's or any of its Subsidiary's assets under,
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, contract or other agreement, instrument or obligation
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them or any of their properties or assets may be bound or (iii) subject to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and compliance with the requirements
specified in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of Section 3.3(c), conflict

injunction, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this
Section 3.3(b) for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations or losses which, individually or in
the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to be material to the Company and its

                                       11
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
lists all consents, waivers and approvals under any of Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' material agreements, licenses or leases required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (c) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization of,
or registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any court, arbitrational
tribunal, administrative agency or commission or other governmental or
regulatory authority, agency or instrumentality, foreign or domestic (a
"Governmental Entity"), is required by or with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the transactions

the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (v) such consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be
required under applicable state securities laws and (vi) such other consents,
licenses, permits, orders, authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations
which, if not obtained or made, would not be reasonably likely, individually or
in the aggregate, to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

          (d) The affirmative vote for approval and adoption of this Agreement
and the Plan of Merger by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock on the record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting is
the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company's capital
stock or other securities necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the
Plan of Merger and for consummation by the Company of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. There are no holders of bonds, debentures, notes
or other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (nor holders of
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company convertible into,
or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which shareholders of the Company may vote.

         (c) Each Company Employee Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws and
the regulations thereunder (including without limitation Section 4980 B of the
Code, Subtitle K, Chapter 100 of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 and
Section 701 et seq. of ERISA) and in accordance with its terms and each of the
Company, the Company's Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates has in all
material respects met its obligations with respect to such Company Employee Plan
and has made all required contributions thereto (or reserved such contributions
on the Company Balance Sheet). All material filings and reports as to each
Company Employee Plan required to have been submitted to the Internal Revenue
Service or to the United States Department of Labor have been timely submitted.
With respect to the Company Employee Plans, no event has occurred, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances in
connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject to
any material liability under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.

         (d) With respect to the Company Employee Plans, there are no material
benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly
accrued and there are no material benefit obligations which have not been
accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with

Employee Plan which is funded are reported at their fair market value on the
books and records of such Employee Benefit Plan.

         (e) All the Company Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination letters from the

income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, no
such determination letter has been revoked and, to the Company's knowledge,
revocation has not been threatened, and no such Employee Benefit Plan has been
amended or operated since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect, and, to the Company's knowledge, no act or
omission has occurred, that would adversely affect its qualification or

compliance with, and satisfies in all material respects the requirements of
Section 401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be, for
each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date.

         (f) Neither the Company, any of the Company's Subsidiaries nor any of
their ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever maintained a Company Employee Plan which was
ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been
obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Company Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or
related to a "voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning
of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No Company Employee Plan holds securities
issued by the Company, any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates.

         (g) Each Company Employee Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally
by the Company and any of the Company's Subsidiaries party thereto or covered
thereby at any time without liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
as a result thereof, and no Company Employee Plan, plan documentation or
agreement, summary plan description or other written communication distributed
generally to employees by its terms prohibits the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries party thereto or covered thereby from amending or
terminating any such Company Employee Plan.

         (h) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the
date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to any oral or written (i) agreement with any shareholder, director,
executive officer or other key employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (A) the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are
materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (B) providing any term of employment or compensation
guarantee or (C) providing severance benefits or other benefits after the
termination of employment of such director, executive officer or key employee or
(ii) agreement or plan binding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including
any stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan,
stock purchase plan or severance benefit plan, any of the benefits of which
shall be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which shall be
accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which shall be calculated on
the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         (i) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree
medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as required by
applicable law.

         (j) There is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or

ordinary course, that would reasonably be expected to result in material
liability to the Company or to such Company Employee Plan.

         (k) The Company has no liability for benefits under any Company
Employee Plan, except as set forth in the Company's financial statements.

country in which the Company or any of its Affiliates has operations and the
number of employees in each such country.

foreign, federal, state or local statute, law or regulation applicable to the
conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of its properties or
assets, except for such failures to comply, violations and notices as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

     3.15  Permits.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all permits,
           -------
licenses and franchises from Governmental Entities material to the conduct of
their businesses as now being conducted or as presently contemplated to be

          -------------
party to or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or
other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization. There
is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, labor strike,

any of its Subsidiaries. Section 3.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed pursuant to a
work permit or visa.

     3.17 Insurance. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries maintains
          ---------
insurance policies (the "Insurance Policies") with reputable insurance carriers
against all risks of a character and in such amounts as, to the Company's
knowledge, are usually insured against by similarly situated companies in the
same or similar businesses. Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets

                                       27
<PAGE>

forth the insurance coverages maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries and
a history of any claims made and claims paid since January 1, 1999. Each
Insurance Policy is in full force and effect and is valid, outstanding and
enforceable, and all premiums due thereon have been paid in full. None of the
Insurance Policies shall terminate or lapse (or be affected in any other
materially adverse manner) by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with the provisions of each Insurance Policy under which it is
the insured party. No insurer under any Insurance Policy has provided the

notice generally disclaiming liability under any such policy or indicated in
writing any intent to do so or not to renew any such policy.

     3.18  Assets.  The Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns or leases all

clear of all mortgages, security interest, pledges, liens and encumbrances
("Liens") except for (a) Liens which are disclosed in the Company SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement and (b) other Liens which,
individually and in the aggregate, do not materially interfere with the ability
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to conduct their business as currently
conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted by the Company and its
Subsidiaries and have not resulted in, and are not reasonably likely to result
in, a Company Material Adverse Effect.  The tangible assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are free from defects, have been maintained
in accordance with normal industry practice, are in good operating condition and
repair (subject to normal wear and tear) and are suitable for the purpose for
which they are presently used, except for any existing defects or needed repairs
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.  Other than general office
supplies, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains any
inventory.

          -----------------------

Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it will stop buying services or products
from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor has any of the largest 50

              REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER AND THE
                             TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY

     The Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary jointly and severally represent and
warrant to the Company that the statements contained in this Article IV are true
and correct, except as expressly set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary to the Company on or before
the date of this Agreement (the "Buyer Disclosure Schedule").  The Buyer
Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding
to the numbered and lettered sections and paragraphs contained in this Article
IV, and the disclosure in any section or paragraph shall qualify (1) the
corresponding section or paragraph in this Article IV and (2) such other
sections and paragraphs in this Article IV only to the extent that it is clear
from a reading of such document that it also qualifies or applies to such other
sections or paragraphs.

                                       30
<PAGE>

     4.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Each of the Buyer and the Transitory
         --------------------------------
Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed
to be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned, operated or leased or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so organized, qualified
or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, which have not had and
are not reasonably likely to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" means any change,
event, circumstance or effect that is or is reasonably likely to be materially
adverse to the business, assets, liabilities, capitalization, prospects,
condition (financial or other), or results of operations of the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that for purposes of this
Agreement, the following shall not be taken into account in determining whether
there has been or would be a "Buyer Material Adverse Effect": (x) any adverse
change in the stock price or trading volume of the Buyer in and of itself, as
quoted on AMEX, and (y) changes or effects relating to the economy or the IT
services business as a whole not substantially disproportionately affecting the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties hereto agree that the terms "material," "materially" or "materiality" as
used in this Agreement with an initial lower case "m" shall have their
respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard to the meaning
ascribed to Buyer Material Adverse Effect in the prior sentences of this
paragraph.

     4.2 Capitalization. All issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
         --------------
the Transitory Subsidiary are held by the Buyer. The authorized capital stock of
the Buyer consists of (a) 200,000,000 shares of Buyer Common Stock, (b) 503,797
shares of class B common stock, $0.10 par value per share ("Buyer Class B Common
Stock"), and (c) 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share
("Buyer Preferred Stock"). The rights and privileges of each class of Buyer's
capital stock are set forth in the Buyer's Articles of Organization. As of the
close of business on August 17, 2001, (i) 67,796,076 shares of Buyer Common
Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) 4,650,025 shares of Buyer Common Stock
were held in the Buyer's treasury, (iii) 284,891 shares of Buyer Class B Common
Stock were issued and outstanding, (iv) no shares of Buyer Class B Common Stock
were held in the Buyer's treasury and (v) no shares of Buyer Preferred Stock
were issued or outstanding. All shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant
to Section 2.1(c) in connection with the Merger, when issued on the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase
option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription
right or any similar right under any provision of the Massachusetts Business
Corporation Law, the Buyer's Articles of Organization or Bylaws or any agreement
to which the Buyer is a party or is otherwise bound. As of August 17, 2001, the
Buyer had reserved an aggregate of 7,000,000 shares of Buyer Common Stock for
issuance pursuant to the Buyer's 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, under which options

                                       31
<PAGE>

are outstanding for no shares of Buyer Common Stock and 7,000,000 shares of
Buyer Common Stock are available for additional grants as of August 17, 2001.

provision of the Articles of Organization or By-laws of the Buyer or the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Transitory Subsidiary, (ii) conflict

benefit) under, require a consent or waiver under, constitute a change in
control under, require the payment of a penalty under or result in the

          -------------------------------------------------------

          (a) The Buyer has filed all registration statements, forms, reports
and other documents required to be filed by the Buyer with the SEC since January
1, 1998 and has made available to the Company copies of all registration
statements, forms, reports and other documents filed by the Buyer with the SEC
since such date. All such registration statements, forms, reports and other

Buyer SEC Reports, and (iii) did not or will not at the time they were or are
filed contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated in such Buyer SEC Reports or necessary in
order to make the statements in such Buyer SEC Reports, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any related notes and schedules) contained or to be contained in the Buyer
SEC Reports at the time filed (i) complied or will comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were or will be

present in accordance with GAAP the consolidated financial position of the Buyer

          (c) The Registration Statement to be filed by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement will comply as to form in all material respects with the Securities
Act (except to the extent relating to information supplied by or on behalf of
the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement, as to which the Buyer makes no representation). The information in
the Registration Statement (except for information supplied by or on behalf of
the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement, as to which the Buyer makes no representation and which shall not
constitute part of the Buyer SEC Reports for purposes of this Agreement) shall
not at the time the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated in the Registration Statement or necessary in order
to make the statements in the Registration Statement not misleading. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Buyer which should
be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement, the Buyer shall
promptly inform the Company.

     4.5 Tax Matters. To the Buyer's knowledge, after consulting with its
         -----------
advisors, neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has taken or agreed to
take any action which would prevent the Merger from constituting a transaction
qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

         ---------------------------------------
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted
its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement. During the period from
the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, the Transitory Subsidiary
shall not engage in any activities except as provided in or contemplated by this
Agreement.

     4.7 Brokers. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
         -------
other firm or person is or shall be entitled as a result of any action,
agreement or commitment of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary, to any
broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, whose fees and expenses shall be paid by the
Buyer.

     4.8 Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Buyer SEC Reports filed before
         ----------
the date of this Agreement, there is no material action, suit, proceeding,
claim, arbitration or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Buyer
and the Transitory Subsidiary, threatened against or affecting the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary which would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the Buyer and/or the Transitory Subsidiary to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

     4.9 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the Buyer
         ------------------------------------
SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since December 31, 2000

that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result

                                       34

in a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any material change by the Buyer in

     6.1  No Solicitation.
          ---------------

          (a) No Solicitation or Negotiation. Except as set forth in this
Section 6.1, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors or representatives (such

<PAGE>

directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants,
other advisors and representatives being hereinafter referred to collectively as
"Representatives") to directly or indirectly:

             (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or take any other action to

restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1(a) by any Representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to
act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 6.1(a) by the Company.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Plan of Merger at the Company Shareholders Meeting (the
"Specified Time"), the Company may, to the extent required by the fiduciary
obligations of the Company Board, as determined in good faith by the Company
Board after consultation with outside counsel (I) in response to a Superior
Proposal that did not result from a breach by the Company of this Section 6.1,
and subject to compliance with Section 6.1(c), (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company to the person making such Superior Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement (including,
but not limited to, the standstill provision set forth therein) (a "Third Party
Confidentiality Agreement") and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with such person and its Representatives regarding any Superior Proposal, and
(II) in response to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach by
the Company of this Section 6.1, and subject to compliance with Section 6.1(c),
request clarifications regarding the terms and conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal from the person making such Acquisition Proposal for the purpose of
ascertaining whether such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, without,
in the case of this clause (II), providing additional information to such
person.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, at no time prior to the termination of this
Agreement shall the Company or the Company Board release or agree to release any
person or entity from a standstill provision contained in any Third Party
Confidentiality Agreement or any other standstill agreement with any third
party.

             (i) except as set forth in this Section 6.1, withdraw or modify, or

intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (an "Alternative Acquisition

circumstances referred to in Section 6.1(a)); or

             (iii) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may, in response to a
Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach by the Company of this
Section 6.1, withdraw or modify the recommendation by the Company Board or any
committee thereof of this Agreement and the Merger, if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that its
fiduciary obligations require it to do so, but only at a time that is prior to
the Specified Time and is after the third business day following the Buyer's
receipt of written notice advising the Buyer that the Company Board desires to
withdraw or modify the recommendation due to the existence of a Superior
Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal.  Nothing in this
Section 6.1 shall be deemed to (A) permit the Company to take any action
described in clauses (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this Section 6.1(b),
although the Company Board may recommend a Superior Proposal to its shareholders
under the circumstances described in the immediately preceding sentence, (B)
affect any obligation of the Company under this Agreement or (C) limit the
Company's obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting, regardless of whether the Company Board has withdrawn or
modified its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger.

          (c) Notices to the Buyer; Additional Negotiations. The Company shall
              ---------------------------------------------
advise the Buyer as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours,
orally and in writing, of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, or of any inquiry with
respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry and the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry. The Company shall not provide any information to or participate in
discussions or negotiations with the person or entity making any Superior
Proposal until three business days after the Company has first notified the
Buyer of such Acquisition Proposal as required by the preceding sentence. The
Company shall (i) keep the Buyer fully informed, on a current basis to the
extent practicable and, in any event, as promptly as practicable, of the status

                                       40
<PAGE>

and details (including any change to the terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry, (ii) provide to the Buyer as soon as practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or
provided to the Company from any third party in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal or sent or provided by the Company to any third party in connection
with any Superior Proposal, and (iii) if the Buyer shall make a counterproposal,
consider and cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate on its behalf
in good faith with respect to the terms of such counterproposal.
Contemporaneously with providing any information to a third party in connection
with any such Superior Proposal or inquiry, the Company shall furnish a copy of
such information to the Buyer.

          (d) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section
              ----------------------------
6.1 or in Section 6.5 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position with respect to a tender offer
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company Board, based on the opinion of outside counsel,
failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable law.

          (e) Cessation of Ongoing Discussions. The Company shall, and shall
              --------------------------------
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately
all discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have all copies of all nonpublic
information it or its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives have
distributed on or prior to the date of this Agreement to other potential
purchasers returned to the Company as soon as possible.

          (f)  Definitions.  For purposes of this Agreement:
               -----------

               "Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any inquiry, proposal or offer

proposal made by a third party to acquire substantially all the equity
securities or assets of the Company, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a
merger, a consolidation or a sale of its assets, (i) on terms that the Company
Board determines in its good faith judgment to be materially more favorable from
a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (based on the written advice of a
recognized independent financial advisor) taking into account all the terms and

                                       41
<PAGE>

conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by the
Buyer to amend the terms of this Agreement) and (ii) that is reasonably capable
of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; provided, however, that no
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Superior Proposal if any financing

determined as provided in this Section 6.12(a) (and otherwise subject to the
terms of the Company Stock Plans (other than the Company ESPP) and the

shares of Buyer Common Stock to be subject to each Buyer Stock Option shall be
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the Exchange Ratio; provided that any fractional shares resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise
price per share of Buyer Common Stock under each Buyer Stock Option shall be

                                       46
<PAGE>

Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time

Time, the Buyer shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such
Buyer Stock Options that are eligible for registration on Form S-8, and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such
Buyer Stock Options remain outstanding.

          (d) Before the Effective Time, the Buyer shall take whatever action is
necessary with respect to its Amended and Restated 1992 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the "Buyer ESPP") to provide for a special offering period commencing at

December 31, 2001 (the "Special ESPP Period") pursuant to which the Buyer shall
allow the Company's employees otherwise eligible to participate in the Buyer
ESPP (based on an adjusted date of hire to coincide with the date of hire by the

the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Buyer is not assuming the

years from the Effective Time, to honor all of the Company's obligations under
Article VII of the Articles of Incorporation of the Company to indemnify and
hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company (the
"Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising

in amount and scope at least as favorable to such persons as the Company's
existing coverage; provided, that in no event shall the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such coverage, which current annual premium is

of such party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality to
be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of the Buyer and
the Transitory Subsidiary or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer,
director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this

to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such party's obligation
to consummate the Merger.

exchange offer, fails to recommend against acceptance of such offer or takes no
position with respect to the acceptance thereof; or (v) the Company shall have

     9.4 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 6.14, this
         ----------------------------
Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or
remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any
person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.

     9.5 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
         ----------
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the
prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such
prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the Buyer and/or the

or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the

validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of

unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination
shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and
this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid
and enforceable term or provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.

Virginia.

           --------
herein expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative with and not
